“I’ve been writing to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> twice a day for the past fortnight, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’t budge.
<PER>Snape</PER> threw off <PER>Snape</PER>'s cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at <PER>Snape</PER>'s white and trembling hands clasped in <PER>Snape</PER>'s lap.
“So, what can I do for you?” <PER>Snape</PER> asked, settling <PER>Snape</PER> in the armchair opposite the two sisters.
“And then he will return to his bedroom.” Wormtail winced as though <PER>Snape</PER> had thrown something at <PER>Snape</PER>.
“This can be easily arranged: I shall speak to <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “I can speak to him myself if I want to!” “Of course you can,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, sneering.
<PER>Snape</PER> refilled <PER>Snape</PER>'s glasses.
<PER>Snape</PER> set <PER>Snape</PER>'s glass down upon the table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Bellatrix’s glowering face.
<PER>Snape</PER> picked up <PER>Snape</PER>'s drink again, sipped it, and continued, “You ask where I was when <PER>Voldemort</PER> fell.
“You ask why I did not attempt to find <PER>Voldemort</PER> when <PER>Voldemort</PER> vanished.
“While I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s pet!” “Not quite,” said <PER>Snape</PER> calmly.
“What useful information have we had from you?” “My information has been conveyed directly to <PER>the Dark Lord</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“No, you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, <PER>Snape</PER>?” “My orders were to remain behind,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Perhaps you disagree with <PER>Voldemort</PER>, perhaps you think that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix?
“He lately, we I am asking you, <PER>Snape</PER>!” “If I had murdered <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, <PER>Voldemort</PER> could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible — ” “You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she jeered.
“And you overlook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s greatest weakness: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has to believe the best of people.
“Even <PER>Snape</PER> says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!” But Even <PER>Snape</PER> had gotten to Even <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk.
“To punish <PER>Lucius</PER>?” “If <PER>Draco</PER> succeeds,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, still looking away from her, “he will be honored above all others.” “But he won’t succeed!” sobbed Narcissa.
“I cannot pretend that <PER>Voldemort</PER> is not angry with <PER>Lucius</PER>.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> does not mean him to succeed, <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants him to be killed trying!” When <PER>Snape</PER> said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed.
Standing up, she staggered to <PER>Snape</PER> and seized the front of <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes.
<PER>Snape</PER> stooped, seized <PER>Snape</PER>'s by the arms, lifted <PER>Snape</PER>'s up, and steered <PER>Snape</PER>'s back onto the sofa.
<PER>Snape</PER> then poured <PER>Snape</PER>'s more wine and forced the glass into <PER>Snape</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Snape</PER> lowered <PER>Snape</PER> so that <PER>Snape</PER> was kneeling opposite Narcissa.
“Will you, Severus, watch over my son, <PER>Draco</PER>, as he attempts to fulfill <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wishes?” “I will,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“And, should it prove necessary if it seems <PER>Draco</PER> will fail ” whispered Narcissa (<PER>Snape</PER>’s hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), “will you carry out the deed that <PER>Voldemort</PER> has ordered <PER>Draco</PER> to perform?” There was a moment’s silence.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter had been sitting in a chair beside <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's bedroom window for the best part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one side of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's face pressed against the cold windowpane, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's glasses askew and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's mouth wide open.
Said Mistress Augusta Longbottom, “My grandson, <PER>Neville</PER> — a good friend of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and — But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong — his reply to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s letter might have gone astray; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could be prevented from collecting <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s letter might turn out not to be from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> at all, but a trick or joke or trap.
The only gesture <PER>Harry</PER> had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut <PER>Harry</PER>'s snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.
Hastily straightening <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and unsticking <PER>Harry</PER>'s cheek from the glass, <PER>Harry</PER> pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped up as though <PER>Harry</PER> had received an electric shock, knocked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair, and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk.
<PER>Harry</PER> had completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might be coming.
Feeling both panicky and close to laughter, <PER>Harry</PER> clambered over the trunk and wrenched open <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, “Good evening.
“Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, <PER>Harry</PER> did not warn you that I was coming,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pleasantly.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not doubt that speech would return to <PER>Harry</PER>, and soon — the vein pulsing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle’s temple was reaching danger point — but something about <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to have robbed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> temporarily of breath.
“Ah, good evening <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER> through <PER>Harry</PER>'s half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression.
“Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction.
“We have corresponded, of course.” <PER>Harry</PER> thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that <PER>Harry</PER> had once sent Aunt Petunia's an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term.
“And this must be your son, <PER>Dudley</PER>?” <PER>Dudley</PER> had that moment peered round the living room door.
“Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> simply, “I shall.” He drew his wand so rapidly that <PER>Harry</PER> barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursley s so that they collapsed upon it in a heap.
As he replaced his wand in his pocket, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s flesh had been burned away.
“Sir — what happened to your — ?” “Later, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, raising his glass to <PER>Harry</PER>, who caught hold of his own and sipped.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not suppress a suspicion that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was rather enjoying <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, turning toward him, “a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> both turned to look at him.
“And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius’s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.” Without realizing what he was doing, <PER>Harry</PER> sprang to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet; the telescope and trainers in <PER>Harry</PER>'s lap rolled across the floor.
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> politely, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand again.
“But it would have been better manners to drink it, you know.” It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but Uncle Vernon merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER> and said nothing, keeping Uncle Vernon's small piggy eyes on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s wand.
“You see,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, turning back to <PER>Harry</PER> and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, “if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited — ” He flicked his wand for a fifth time.
<PER>Dudley</PER> drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though his thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, “What the hell is that?” “Kreacher,” finished <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won’t, won’t, won’t — ” “As you can see, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> loudly, over Kreacher’s continued croaks of “won’t, won’t, won’t,” “Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.” “I don’t care,” said <PER>Harry</PER> again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf.
“I don’t want <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — ” “You would prefer <PER>Harry</PER> to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange?
<PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth still working furiously, He's eyes bulging.
After a few seconds of frantic gulping, <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and feet, giving <PER>Harry</PER> over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.
“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily, hurrying to pick up <PER>Harry</PER>'s fallen telescope and trainers.
It took <PER>Harry</PER> a little over ten minutes to track down everything <PER>Harry</PER> needed; at last <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to extract <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk shut on <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron.
Then, heaving <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig’s cage in the other, <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way back downstairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> was disappointed to discover that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was not waiting in the hall, which meant that <PER>Harry</PER> had to return to the living room.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was humming quietly, apparently quite at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare look at the Dursleys as <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Professor — I’m ready now.” “Good,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“As you will no doubt be aware, <PER>Harry</PER> comes of age in a year’s time — ” “No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s arrival.
“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that <PER>Harry</PER> has powerful protection while <PER>Harry</PER> can still call this house ‘home.’ However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed he houseroom.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER> time for us to be off,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> at last, standing up and straightening his long black cloak.
“Bye,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily to the Dursleys, and followed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who paused beside <PER>Harry</PER>’s trunk, upon which Hedwig’s cage was perched.
“We do not want to be encumbered by these just now,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, pulling out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand again.
When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> waved <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> then waved <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand again, and the front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.
“And now, <PER>Harry</PER>, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.” Despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would indeed come to fetch him, <PER>Harry</PER> felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet Drive together.
The memory of them's last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened <PER>Harry</PER>’s sense of embarrassment; <PER>Harry</PER> had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done <PER>Harry</PER>'s best to smash several of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s most prized possessions.
“This will do, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.
“Well, here we go.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s arm twist away from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and redoubled <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then — he gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes.
“The sensation does take some getting used to.” “I’m fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly.
“So tell me, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Your scar has it been hurting at all?” <PER>Harry</PER> raised a hand unconsciously to <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark.
“Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> has finally realized the dangerous access to Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> again.
“Professor?” “<PER>Harry</PER>?” “Er — where exactly are we?” “This, <PER>Harry</PER>, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.” “And what are we doing here?” “Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Thinking of dementors, <PER>Harry</PER> cast a look over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not consider it rude to call on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had more pressing questions to ask.
“For future reference, <PER>Harry</PER>, it is raspberry although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.” “Er right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the front gate, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stopped dead and <PER>Harry</PER> walked into <PER>Harry</PER>.
he opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, <PER>Harry</PER> at <PER>Harry</PER>'s heels, then pushed the front door very slowly, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand raised and at the ready.
“Lumos.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s wand tip ignited, casting <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s wand tip light up a narrow hallway.
Holding his illuminated wand aloft, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked into the sitting room with <PER>Harry</PER> right behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s small intake of breath made <PER>Dumbledore</PER> look around.
“Yes, something horrible has happened here.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed, gazing around, half-scared of what <PER>Harry</PER> might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.
“Ohol” “This,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, moving forward to make the introduction, “is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER> and directed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> toward a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated, which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp.
<PER>Harry</PER> took the seat with the distinct impression that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, for some reason, wanted to keep <PER>Harry</PER> as visible as possible.
“Here — ” He gave a drink to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at <PER>Harry</PER>, and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence.
If <PER>Harry</PER> had not known who lived there, <PER>Harry</PER> would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady.
“Reactions not what they were, I see.” “You’re quite right,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> serenely, shaking back <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck prickle unpleasantly.
Slughorn’s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw a tiny frown momentarily crease <PER>Harry</PER>'s wide forehead.
Slughorn ’s watery eyes slid over <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar, this time taking in the rest of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Oh, now,” he went on quickly, seeing the expression on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and wagging a stubby finger at <PER>Harry</PER>, “don’t go holding that against me!
“Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and none of the teachers has ever been killed — well, unless you count <PER>Quirrell</PER>, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” he had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which he ignored.
“I reckon the staff are safer than most people while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s headmaster; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s supposed to be the only one <PER>Voldemort</PER> ever feared, isn’t he?” <PER>Harry</PER> went on.
He twiddled He's fat thumbs and fidgeted as He watched <PER>Dumbledore</PER> fasten his traveling cloak, and <PER>Harry</PER> zip up <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s jacket.
As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn ’s voice floated after them, “111 want a pay rise, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> chuckled.
“Well done, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Horace,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, relieving <PER>Harry</PER> of the responsibility to say any of this, “likes his comfort.
When the pressure disappeared and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> able to breathe again, <PER>Harry</PER> was standing in a country lane beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of <PER>Harry</PER>'s second favorite building in the world: the Burrow.
“If you don’t mind, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, as they passed through the gate, “I’d like a few words with you before we part.
A little puzzled, <PER>Harry</PER> followed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> illuminated the tip of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> could tell that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> understood, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might even suspect that until <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s letter arrived, <PER>Harry</PER> had spent nearly all <PER>Harry</PER>'s time at the Dursleys’ lying on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, refusing meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors.
“It’s just hard,” <PER>Harry</PER> said finally, in a low voice, “to realize <PER>Harry</PER> won’t write to <PER>Harry</PER> again.” <PER>Harry</PER> eyes burned suddenly and <PER>Harry</PER> blinked.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to <PER>Harry</PER>, almost like a parent, had been one of the best things about discovering He's godfather and now the post owls would never bring He that comfort again.
“Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mister <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley and Miss <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
He continued, “On a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.” “Private — with you?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, surprised out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s preoccupied silence.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited hopefully, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not elaborate, so <PER>Harry</PER> asked something else that had been bothering <PER>Harry</PER> slightly.
“If I’m having lessons with you, I won’t have to do Occlumency lessons with <PER>Snape</PER>, will I?” “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> — and no, you will not.” “Good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in relief, “because they were a — ” He stopped, careful not to say what He really thought.
“Well, that means I won’t see much of Professor <PER>Snape</PER> from now on,” Professor <PER>Snape</PER> said, “because Professor <PER>Snape</PER> won’t let me carry on Potions unless I get ‘Outstanding’ in my O.W.L., which I know I haven’t.” “Don’t count your owls before they are delivered,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gravely.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knocked three times and <PER>Harry</PER> saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window.
“Declare yourself!” “It is I, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, bringing <PER>Harry</PER>.” The door opened at once.
“Wotcher, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Hi, Tonks.” <PER>Harry</PER> thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was something forced in shis smile.
“Thanks for the tea and sympathy, Molly.” “Please don’t leave on my account,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> courteously, “I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.” “No, no, I need to get going,” said Tonks, not meeting <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyes.
“ ’Night — ” “Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and Mad-Eye are coming — ?” “No, really, Molly thanks anyway Good night, everyone.” Tonks hurried past <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air.
“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Molly closed the door on the empty yard and then steered <PER>Harry</PER> by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine <PER>Harry</PER>'s appearance.
“You’re like <PER>Ron</PER>,” she sighed, looking <PER>Harry</PER> up and down.
“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.” As <PER>Harry</PER> sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and settled there, purring.
“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth so full of hot soup that <PER>Harry</PER> could not speak.
“<PER>Harry</PER> was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I think.
<PER>Harry</PER> swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat blistering.
Hedwig hooted happily at <PER>Harry</PER> from Hedwig's perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; <PER>Harry</PER> knew she had been waiting to see <PER>Harry</PER> before going hunting.
Seconds later, or so it seemed to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open.
Sitting bolt upright, <PER>Harry</PER> heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling sunlight seemed to poke <PER>Harry</PER> hard in both eyes.
Shielding them with one hand, <PER>Harry</PER> groped hopelessly for <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses with the other.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s hand found <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and <PER>Harry</PER> shoved them on, though the light was so bright <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly see anyway.
“All right?” “Never been better,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, rubbing the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and slumping back onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillows.
“We thought — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> flashed a warning look at <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> changed tack at top speed.
“Something wrong, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER>?
“He can’t be worse than <PER>Umbridge</PER>, can He?” “I know someone who’s worse than <PER>Umbridge</PER>,” said a voice from the doorway.
“Hi, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “What’s up with you?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked.
“It’s her,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, plonking herself down on <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed.
“It’s the way she talks to me — you’d think I was about three!” “I know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, dropping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>’s so full of <PER>Hermione</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> was astonished to hear <PER>Hermione</PER> talking about Molly like this and could not blame <PER>Ron</PER> for saying angrily, “Can’t you two lay off Molly's for five seconds?” “Oh, that’s right, defend Molly,” snapped <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Starting to feel that he was missing something, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Who are you — ?” But <PER>Harry</PER>'s question was answered before <PER>Harry</PER> could finish it.
The bedroom door flew open again, and <PER>Harry</PER> instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chin so hard that <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> slid off the bed onto the floor.
“There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself!” “Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees and then swooping to kiss <PER>Harry</PER> on each cheek: <PER>Harry</PER> felt the places where her mouth had touched <PER>Harry</PER> burn.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help noticing how Molly, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were all determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze.
“Well, you do,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but if her jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then ” “It’s pathetic,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> furiously, striding away from <PER>Ron</PER> as far as <PER>Hermione</PER> could go and turning to face him with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arms folded once <PER>Hermione</PER> had reached the wall.
“You don’t really want her around forever?” <PER>Ginny</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> incredulously.
When he merely shrugged, <PER>Ginny</PER> said, “Well, Mum’s going to put a stop to it if <PER>Ginny</PER> can, I bet you anything.” “How’s <PER>Ginny</PER> going to manage that?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t spoken, “I was just saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur — ” “I’d much rather have Tonks in the family,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> thinks it was <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fault he died!” “How does <PER>Hermione</PER> work that one out?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, in spite of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, <PER>Hermione</PER> was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t <PER>Hermione</PER>?
“I know Lupin’s tried to talk <PER>Hermione</PER>'s round, but <PER>Hermione</PER>’s still really down.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” <PER>Ginny</PER> whispered, “come downstairs and help me with the lunch.” “I’m talking to this lot!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, outraged.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was peering into Fred and George’s boxes, though every now and then <PER>Hermione</PER> cast sideways looks at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who was now helping himself to <PER>Harry</PER>’s toast, was still gazing dreamily at the door.
“Dunno,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but if Fred and George’ve left it here, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful.” “Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But he knows your dad was right all along now about <PER>Voldemort</PER> being back — ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I heard him telling your mum, <PER>Ron</PER>.” “Sounds like the sort of mental thing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would say,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> choked on his bit of toast, and <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped.
“<PER>Harry</PER> told me last night in your broom shed.” “Blimey private lessons with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking impressed.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw him and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchange looks.
<PER>Harry</PER> laid down <PER>Harry</PER>'s knife and fork, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart beating rather fast considering that all <PER>Harry</PER> was doing was sitting in bed.
He fixed He's eyes on He's fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into He's lap, and said, “I don’t know exactly why He’s going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.” Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke.
<PER>Harry</PER> continued, still speaking to <PER>Harry</PER>'s fork, “You know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry.” “Nobody knows what it said, though,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly.
“It got smashed.” “Although the Prophet says — ” began <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Shh!” “The Prophet’s got it right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking up at them both with a great effort: <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed frightened and <PER>Ron</PER> amazed.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>!” shouted <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash.
“Don’t worry,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was plainly trying not to laugh, “Mumll fix that, she’s good at healing minor injuries — ” “Oh well, never mind that now!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, oh, <PER>Harry</PER> ” <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on the edge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed again.
“We wondered, after We got back from the Ministry Obviously, We didn’t want to say anything to you, but from what <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> said about the prophecy, how it was about you and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, well, We thought it might be something like this.
he knew that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though him were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than him could ever tell them. "
“Hang on,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as another part of last night’s conversation came back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It just won’t budge,” Molly was saying anxiously, standing over <PER>Hermione</PER> with Molly's wand in Molly's hand and a copy of The Healer’s Helpmate open at “Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This has always worked before, I just can’t understand it.” “It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a funny joke, making sure it can’t come off,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> “But it’s got to come off!” squeaked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers together.
“And when you’ve got your eleven ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L.s ” “Don’t, don’t, don’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, flapping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands hysterically.
“I know I’ve failed everything!” “What happens if we fail?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked the room at large, but it was again <PER>Hermione</PER> who answered.
“We discuss We options with We Head of House, I asked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> at the end of last term.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach squirmed.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had eaten less breakfast.
“They’re definitely owls,” said <PER>Ron</PER> hoarsely, jumping up to join <PER>Hermione</PER> at the window.
“Oh no oh no oh no ” She gripped both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> tightly around the elbows.
To <PER>Harry</PER>'s left, <PER>Ron</PER> was trying to detach his own results; to his right, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hands were shaking so much <PER>Hermione</PER>’s was making <PER>Hermione</PER>’s's whole owl tremble.

<PER>Hermione</PER> had <PER>Hermione</PER>'s back to He and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head bent, but <PER>Ron</PER> was looking delighted.
“Here — swap — ” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced down <PER>Ron</PER>’s grades: There were no “Outstandings” there.
“Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, punching <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder.
“Seven O.W.L.s, that’s more than Fred and George got together!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Ginny</PER> tentatively, for <PER>Hermione</PER> still hadn’t turned around.
“You’re actually disappointed, aren’t you?” <PER>Hermione</PER> shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head, but <PER>Harry</PER> laughed.
“Mum, are there any more sausages?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked back down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s results.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent most of <PER>Harry</PER>'s days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys’ orchard (he and <PER>Hermione</PER> against <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> was dreadful and <PER>Ginny</PER> good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Molly put in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“The man who ran — ” “ — the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” <PER>Harry</PER> interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s included a surprise: <PER>Harry</PER> had been made Quidditch Captain.
“And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!” <PER>Ron</PER> turned to stare incredulously at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into Molly's arms and stormed out of the room.
Bill, who would be staying at home with Fleur (much to <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> mimed vomiting into <PER>Ginny</PER>'s cereal behind Fleur.
<PER>Harry</PER> choked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s cornflakes, and <PER>Ron</PER> thumped <PER>Harry</PER> on the back.
He, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat.
“Ah, good, he’s here!” <PER>Harry</PER> imitated Arthur and peered through the window; <PER>Harry</PER> imitated Arthur's heart leapt.
There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black- bearded form of Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” he boomed, sweeping <PER>Harry</PER> into a bone- crushing hug the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had stepped out of the car.
“Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh should see him, <PER>Harry</PER>, him’s so happy ter be back in the open air — ” “Glad he’s pleased,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning as he massaged his ribs.
He looked up hopefully as they entered, but before He could speak, <PER>Hagrid</PER> said importantly, “Jus’ passin’ through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know.” Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood.
“I think we’d better do Madam Malkin’s first, <PER>Hermione</PER> wants new dress robes, and <PER>Ron</PER>’s showing much too much ankle in <PER>Ron</PER>’s's school robes, and you must need new ones too, <PER>Ron</PER>’s, you’ve grown so much — come on, everyone — ” “Molly, it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin’s,” said Arthur.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, do you think — ?” “Don’ fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid.
Molly did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with Molly's husband and <PER>Ginny</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> set off for Madam Malkin’s.
“I’ll stand guard outside, all right?” So <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the little shop together.
It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> than <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue. "
He strode to the mirror and examined He; it was a few moments before He noticed <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> reflected over He's shoulder.
“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in,” said <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“And I don’t want wands drawn in my shop either!” she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had shown shis <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both standing there with their wands out and pointing at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Put those away,” she said coldly to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Really, you shouldn’t accuse — dangerous thing to say — wands away, please!” But <PER>Harry</PER> did not lower <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“I see that being <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s favorite has given you a false sense of security, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
“I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with <PER>Lucius</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand higher.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” moaned <PER>Hermione</PER>, grabbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm and attempting to push it down by <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
She bent toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was still glaring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’re right, <PER>Draco</PER>,” said Narcissa, with a contemptuous glance at <PER>Hermione</PER>, “now I know the kind of scum that shops here.
She was distracted all through the fitting of <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Harry</PER>’s new robes, tried to sell <PER>Hermione</PER> wizard’s dress robes instead of witch’s, and when She finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them.
“Did you see the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, unconcerned.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard a weak sort of moan beside <PER>Harry</PER> and looked around to see Molly gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster.
“No They won’t!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who, like <PER>Harry</PER>, was laughing.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during the twins's last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf.
A space cleared in the crowd, and <PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box that read: REUSABLE “ ‘Patented Daydream Charms ’ ” <PER>Hermione</PER> had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’ll give you a tour.” <PER>Harry</PER> left <PER>Hermione</PER> dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred bracingly toward the back of the shop, where <PER>Harry</PER> saw a stand of card and rope tricks.
“Take whatever you like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if people ask.” George swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Fred led <PER>Harry</PER> back into the main part of the shop to find <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> both hung back, looking wary.
“But we’re not selling them to we sister,” he added, becoming suddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about five boys on the go from what we’ve — ” “Whatever you’ve heard from <PER>Ron</PER> is a big fat lie,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf.
“But you’re moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren’t you?” <PER>Ginny</PER> turned to look at him, <PER>Ginny</PER>'s hands on <PER>Ginny</PER>'s hips.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was hurrying up the street alone.
As <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> passed Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> glanced over <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s shoulder.
Seconds later, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> said nothing; <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking too hard.
Narcissa <PER>Malfoy</PER> would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; <PER>Malfoy</PER> must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches.
<PER>Harry</PER>, knowing and loathing <PER>Malfoy</PER>, was sure the reason could not be innocent.
“Get under here, quick,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak out of Invisibility Cloak's bag.
“Oh — I don’t know, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking uncertainly toward Molly.
She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, <PER>Malfoy</PER> had disappeared just as successfully as they had.
“He was going in that direction,” murmured <PER>Harry</PER> as quietly as possible, so that the humming <PER>Hagrid</PER> would not hear them.
There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which <PER>Harry</PER> had once hidden to avoid <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s father.
“Extendable Ears, look!” “Fantastic!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ron</PER> unraveled the long, fleshcolored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> shuffled sideways to try and keep He in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.
himself passed so close to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again.
“<PER>Harry</PER> wants something mended and <PER>Harry</PER> wants to reserve something in there.
<PER>Hermione</PER> checked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again.
<PER>Ron</PER> hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Hello, horrible morning, isn’t it?” <PER>Hermione</PER> said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast <PER>Hermione</PER>'s a suspicious look.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the nasty feeling <PER>Harry</PER> knew exactly what <PER>Hermione</PER> was up to.
Apparently <PER>Hermione</PER> felt <PER>Hermione</PER> had been rumbled too because <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly threw caution to the winds.
“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just now, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I want to get he a birthday present, but if he’s already reserved anything, I obviously don’t want to get he the same thing, so um ” It was a pretty lame story in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too.
“Get out!” <PER>Hermione</PER> did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s heels.
“Ah well,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, throwing the cloak back over <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> bickered all the way back to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Molly and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had clearly noticed their absence.
Once in the shop, <PER>Harry</PER> whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Molly’s accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked properly.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s behavior in Knockturn Alley.
What disturbed <PER>Harry</PER> most was the satisfied look on <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face as <PER>Harry</PER> had left the shop.
To his slight annoyance, however, neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed quite as curious about <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s activities as his was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.
“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> a little impatiently.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George’s room with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s new copy of Advanced Rune Translation.
“Remember that shriveled-up arm <PER>Malfoy</PER> had?” “But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep that one safe’?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> for the umpteenth time.
“That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of the broken objects, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> wants both.” “You reckon?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.
When neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> answered, he said, “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s father’s in Azkaban.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in an anxious voice.
“I think he just wanted to get out of there, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
On the landing <PER>Harry</PER> bumped into <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.
The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find The Ministry cars waiting, trunks packed; <PER>Hermione</PER>’s cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; <PER>Ron</PER>’s owl, Pigwidgeon; and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.
<PER>Ron</PER> hurried forward, looking hopeful, but <PER>Ginny</PER> stuck out her foot and <PER>Ron</PER> fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur’s feet.
“<PER>Harry</PER> had better go first, with — ” She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s upper arm, and attempted to steer <PER>Harry</PER> toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.
“I can walk, thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER> irritably, jerking <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm out of the Auror’s grip.
Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, <PER>Harry</PER> motioned to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment.
“We can’t, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking apologetic.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and I’ve got to go to the prefects’ carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.” “Oh yeah, I forgot,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if <PER>Harry</PER> was to tell anyone, Mister Weasley was the right person; firstly, because <PER>Harry</PER> worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly, because <PER>Harry</PER> thought that there was not too much risk of Arthur exploding with anger.
“When we were in Diagon Alley,” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but Mister Weasley forestalled <PER>Harry</PER> with a grimace.
“Am I about to discover where you, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George’s shop?” “How did you — ?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, please.
After a moment he said, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I doubt whether <PER>Voldemort</PER> would allow a sixteen-year-old — ” “Does anyone really know what <PER>Voldemort</PER> would or wouldn’t do?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
“You see, when <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was arrested, we raided <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s house.
“Now, dear, you’re coming to us for Christmas, it’s all fixed with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, so we’ll see you quite soon,” said Molly through the window, as <PER>Harry</PER> slammed the door shut behind <PER>Harry</PER> and the train began to move.
<PER>Harry</PER> supposed <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were cloistered in the prefects’ carriage, but <PER>Ginny</PER> was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends.
“Fancy trying to find a compartment?” “I can’t, <PER>Harry</PER>, I said I’d meet Dean,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> brightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, shis long red hair dancing behind she; <PER>Harry</PER> had become so used to shis presence over the summer that <PER>Harry</PER> had almost forgotten that <PER>Ginny</PER> did not hang around with him, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> while at school.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and looked around: <PER>Harry</PER> was surrounded by mesmerized girls.
“<PER>Neville</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> in relief, turning to see a round- faced boy struggling toward a round- faced boy.
“Hello, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Because us’re with you!” “They’re staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> hoisted <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk into the luggage rack.
“No point now we’ve got rid of <PER>Umbridge</PER>, is there?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting down.
<PER>Neville</PER> bumped <PER>Neville</PER>'s head against the seat as he emerged from under it.
with only an “Acceptable,” <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> without really listening.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s childhood had been blighted by <PER>Voldemort</PER> just as much as <PER>Harry</PER>’s had, but <PER>Neville</PER> had no idea how close <PER>Neville</PER> had come to having <PER>Harry</PER>’s destiny.
The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had chosen to believe that <PER>Harry</PER> was the one meant.
Had <PER>Voldemort</PER> chosen <PER>Neville</PER>, it would be <PER>Neville</PER> sitting opposite <PER>Harry</PER> bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of The prophecy.
Would <PER>Neville</PER>’s mother have died to save <PER>Neville</PER>’s, as Lily had died for <PER>Harry</PER>?
An empty seat where <PER>Neville</PER> now sat and a scarless <PER>Harry</PER> who would have been kissed good- bye by his own mother, not <PER>Ron</PER>’s?
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> caught each other’s eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.
It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the compartment at last.
“Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving,” said <PER>Ron</PER> longingly, slumping into the seat beside <PER>Harry</PER> and rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
Didn’t this look as though <PER>Malfoy</PER> had more important things on <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s mind than bullying younger students?
“I’m supposed to deliver these to <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom and <PER>Harry</PER> P-Potter,” she faltered, as shis eyes met <PER>Harry</PER>’s and she turned scarlet.
Perplexed, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> took the scroll addressed to each of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.
“What is it?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded, as <PER>Harry</PER> unrolled his.
<PER>Harry</PER>, I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C. Sincerely, Professor H. E. F. Slug horn “Who’s Professor Slughorn?” asked <PER>Neville</PER>, looking perplexedly at Who’s Professor Slughorn?”'s own invitation.
<PER>Harry</PER> stowed it regretfully back in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since <PER>Harry</PER> had last walked down the train.
The exception was <PER>Cho</PER> Chang, who darted into her compartment when her saw <PER>Harry</PER> coming.
As <PER>Harry</PER> passed the window, <PER>Harry</PER> saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys <PER>Harry</PER> did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Now, do you know everyone?” Slughorn asked <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course — Blaise Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did <PER>Harry</PER> or <PER>Neville</PER>: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.
<PER>Ginny</PER> grimaced at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> from behind Slughorn’s back.
“I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,” Slughorn told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>, now passing around a basket of rolls.
It was <PER>Neville</PER>’s turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents, well- known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies.
At the end of <PER>Neville</PER>’s interview, <PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on <PER>Neville</PER>, yet to see whether <PER>Harry</PER> had any of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ flair.
“<PER>Neville</PER> and I were both there too, and all this ‘<PER>Cho</PER>sen One’ rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual.” “You were both there too, were you?” said Slughorn with great interest, looking from <PER>Ginny</PER> to <PER>Neville</PER>, but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile.
“I remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) — ” He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but <PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with <PER>Harry</PER>, and that <PER>Harry</PER> had not been convinced by <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Well, off you go, off you go!” As he pushed past <PER>Harry</PER> into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that <PER>Harry</PER> returned with interest.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> followed Zabini back along the train.
“How come you ended up in there, <PER>Ginny</PER>?” “He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
If <PER>Harry</PER> could only enter, unseen, behind <PER>Harry</PER>, what might <PER>Harry</PER> not see or hear?
True, there was little of the journey left — Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows — but nobody else seemed prepared to take <PER>Harry</PER>’s suspicions seriously, so it was down to <PER>Harry</PER> to prove them.
“I’ll see you two later,” said <PER>Harry</PER> under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, pulling out <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over <PER>Harry</PER>.
Zabini was already sliding Zabini shut when <PER>Harry</PER> hastily stuck out <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot to prevent Zabini closing.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized the door and pushed the door open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, <PER>Harry</PER> darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted <PER>Harry</PER> up into the luggage rack.
It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of <PER>Harry</PER> remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s forehead, smirking as Pansy did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in Pansy's place.
“Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at ‘the <PER>Cho</PER>sen One,’ ” sneered <PER>Malfoy</PER>, “but that Weasley girl!
<PER>Malfoy</PER> sank back across <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s lap and allowed <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s to resume the stroking of his hair.
What would <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> say about this?
“We’d better get We robes on.” <PER>Harry</PER> was so busy staring at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> did not notice Goyle reaching up for <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk; as <PER>Harry</PER> swung it down, it hit <PER>Harry</PER> hard on the side of the head.
<PER>Harry</PER> let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not afraid of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> would take his things out onto the platform for <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> was stuck where <PER>Harry</PER> was until the compartment had quite emptied.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> were alone in the compartment.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> then bent down over <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s trunk and opened <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s trunk again.
<PER>Harry</PER> peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart pumping a little faster.
“Petrificus Totalusl” Without warning, <PER>Malfoy</PER> pointed <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was instantly paralyzed.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose break; blood spurted everywhere.
“See you around, Potter or not.” And taking care to tread on <PER>Harry</PER>’s fingers, <PER>Malfoy</PER> left the compartment.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose flow, hot and wet, over <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never hated <PER>Malfoy</PER> more than as <PER>Harry</PER> lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into <PER>Harry</PER>'s open mouth.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would think that himself had left the train without them.
A feeling of hopelessness spread through he as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage <PER>Malfoy</PER> was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on <PER>Harry</PER> to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.
The train lurched, causing <PER>Harry</PER> to roll over onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off he and a voice overhead said, “Wotcher, <PER>Harry</PER>.” There was a flash of red light and <PER>Harry</PER>’s body unfroze; he was able to push he into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised face with the back of his hand, and raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibility Cloak she had just pulled away.
“Who did it?” “<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
“I can fix your nose if you stand still.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not think much of this idea; <PER>Harry</PER> had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom <PER>Harry</PER> had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so <PER>Harry</PER> stayed stock-still and closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
As <PER>Harry</PER> swung the cloak back over <PER>Harry</PER>, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.
“Was that a Patronus?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, who had seen <PER>Dumbledore</PER> send messages like this.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at Tonks under <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak.
He reflected uncomfortably that <PER>Hermione</PER> would have suggested He say something consoling about Sirius to <PER>Hermione</PER>, that it hadn’t been <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fault at all, but He couldn’t bring He to do it.
<PER>Harry</PER> was cold, <PER>Harry</PER> was hungry, and <PER>Harry</PER> was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind.
But when <PER>Harry</PER> put out a hand to push open the gates, <PER>Harry</PER> found them chained shut.
“Alohomora\” <PER>Harry</PER> said confidently, pointing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> bewitched them <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around.
<PER>Harry</PER> was so pleased to see it <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> could even endure Filch’s wheezy criticisms of <PER>Harry</PER>'s tardiness and rants about how <PER>Harry</PER>'s timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews.
It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak so that <PER>Harry</PER> could be seen, that <PER>Harry</PER> recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.” “I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but <PER>Snape</PER> cut across <PER>Harry</PER>.
“The new one looks weak.” As <PER>Snape</PER> swung the lantern about, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonks’s face.
“Good night,” <PER>Harry</PER> called to shis over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, as <PER>Harry</PER> began the walk up to the school with <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Thanks for everything.” “See you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Snape</PER> did not speak for a minute or so.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that <PER>Snape</PER> could not feel them burning <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> had loathed <PER>Snape</PER> from their first encounter, but <PER>Snape</PER> had placed <PER>Snape</PER> forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of <PER>Harry</PER>’s forgiveness by <PER>Snape</PER>'s attitude toward Sirius.
Whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER> had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that <PER>Snape</PER> ’s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting <PER>Voldemort</PER> had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died.
<PER>Harry</PER> clung to this notion, because it enabled <PER>Harry</PER> to blame <PER>Snape</PER>, which felt satisfying, and also because <PER>Harry</PER> knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness.
“And with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect.” Still <PER>Harry</PER> remained silent, though Still <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest might explode.
Still <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Snape</PER> had come to fetch <PER>Harry</PER> for this, for the few minutes when Still <PER>Harry</PER> could needle and torment <PER>Harry</PER> without anyone else listening.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Harry</PER> could slip <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining Invisibility Cloak's seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed.
As though <PER>Harry</PER> had read <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, however, <PER>Snape</PER> said, “No cloak.
It was all a shimmering blur to <PER>Harry</PER>, however, who walked so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time people were standing up to get a good look at him, him had spotted <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, sped along the benches toward them, and forced his way in between them.
“Why, what’s wrong with it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grabbing a spoon and squinting at <PER>Harry</PER>'s distorted reflection.
“Come here <PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, said “Tergeol” and siphoned off the dried blood.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, feeling <PER>Harry</PER>'s now clean face.
He was very conscious that <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop.
“Not now, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in a darkly significant voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> hoped very much that they would all assume <PER>Harry</PER> had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor.
Of course, <PER>Malfoy</PER> would spread the story as far and wide as <PER>Harry</PER> could, but there was always a chance it wouldn’t reach too many Gryffindor ears.
“You missed the Sorting, anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ron</PER> dived for a large chocolate gateau.
“More of the same, really advising us all to unite in the face of our enemies, you know.” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> mentioned <PER>Voldemort</PER> at all?” “Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast, doesn’t he?
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> was only a few minutes late,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Look, he’s waving at you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at the staff table and grinned at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was indeed waving at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Head of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting.
<PER>Harry</PER> was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s other side; she rarely left shis tower room, and <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen shis at the start-of-term feast before.
Having always considered shis a bit of a fraud, <PER>Harry</PER> had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> to kill <PER>Harry</PER>’s parents and attack <PER>Harry</PER> himself.
The knowledge had made <PER>Harry</PER> even less eager to find <PER>Harry</PER> in her company, but thankfully, this year <PER>Harry</PER> would be dropping Divination.
Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in <PER>Harry</PER>'s direction; <PER>Harry</PER> hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s gaze to <PER>Harry</PER>'s treacle tart, <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides burning again.
What he would not give to fight <PER>Malfoy</PER> one-on-one “So what did Professor Slughorn want?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked.
“People were interrogating us about it on the train, weren’t they, <PER>Ron</PER>?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“All wanting to know if you really are ‘the <PER>Cho</PER>sen One’ — ” “There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts,” interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward <PER>Harry</PER> so that it wobbled dangerously on it ruff.
“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,” said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet at the staff table.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s right hand was as blackened and dead- looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch <PER>Harry</PER> from the Dursleys.
Whispers swept the room; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s purple-and-gold sleeve over his injury.
“Potions?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, turning to stare at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But you said — ” “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, meanwhile,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, raising <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s voice so that it carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.” “No!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, so loudly that many heads turned in <PER>Harry</PER>'s direction.
Hadn’t it been widely known for years that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not trust <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to do it?
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I thought he was!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, racking <PER>Harry</PER>'s brains to remember when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> this, but now that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> came to think of it, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was unable to recall <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ever telling <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what Slughorn would be teaching.
<PER>Snape</PER>, who was sitting on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s right, did not stand up at the mention of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s name; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> could detect a look of triumph on the features <PER>Harry</PER> loathed so much.
“<PER>Snape</PER> ’ll be gone by the end of the year.” “What do you mean?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that <PER>Snape</PER> had finally achieved his heart’s desire.
“Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength.” The silence seemed to tauten and strain as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was not looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but making <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the headmaster’s words unworthy of the headmaster's attention.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to <PER>Malfoy</PER> to allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw ahead of him.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had darted ahead to fulfill <PER>Hermione</PER>'s prefect’s duty of shepherding the first years, but <PER>Ron</PER> remained with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Listen to what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying before <PER>Harry</PER> found out I was there.
With what <PER>Harry</PER> considered pure pigheadedness, however, <PER>Ron</PER> was unimpressed.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was just showing off for Parkinson.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> uses that name,” said <PER>Harry</PER> stubbornly.
“Yeah, well, tha’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, innit?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> mysteriously.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Ron</PER> was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself.
“And you’re not either, are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head too.
“And <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “she’s not, is she?” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> met <PER>Hermione</PER> in the common room before breakfast next morning.
Hoping for some support for his theory, <PER>Harry</PER> lost no time in telling <PER>Hermione</PER> what <PER>Harry</PER> had overheard <PER>Malfoy</PER> saying on the Hogwarts Express.
“But <PER>Harry</PER> was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn’t <PER>Harry</PER>?” interjected <PER>Ron</PER> quickly, before <PER>Hermione</PER> could say anything.
The boy, who had been muttering something about <PER>Harry</PER> behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to <PER>Harry</PER>'s friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm.
“Today’s going to be a real doss, I reckon.” “Hold it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past <PER>Hermione</PER>'s with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand.
<PER>Ron</PER> waited for The scowling boy to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s grip.
“Excellent, I’ve always wanted one of these.” <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found <PER>Ron</PER>’s remark highly amusing.
While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> about their embarrassing conversation with <PER>Hagrid</PER> the previous evening.
They avoided <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s eye and returned <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's cheery wave only halfheartedly when <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s left the staff table ten minutes later.
<PER>Neville</PER> took a little longer to sort out; <PER>Neville</PER>'s round face was anxious as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked down Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s application and then consulted Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s O.W.L.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> peered at him through Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s square spectacles.
“It’s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she’s got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have — particularly after what happened at the Ministry.” <PER>Neville</PER> turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had never paid Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> a compliment before.
“Take Charms,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because her failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.” Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on <PER>Neville</PER>’s face, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> tapped a blank schedule with the tip of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to <PER>Neville</PER>.
“So, Potter, Potter ” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, consulting her notes as she turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Look,” said <PER>Ron</PER> delightedly, gazing at his schedule, “we’ve got a free period now and a free period after break and after lunch excellent.” They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that <PER>Harry</PER> had joined in <PER>Harry</PER>'s first year.
“We got so much homework for Runes,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said anxiously, when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> joined <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I bet <PER>Snape</PER> gives us loads.” The classroom door opened as she spoke, and <PER>Snape</PER> stepped into the corridor, <PER>Snape</PER>'s sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair.
<PER>Snape</PER> had imposed <PER>Snape</PER>'s personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight.
“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily dropped <PER>Hermione</PER>'s copy of Confronting the Faceless back into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag and stowed it under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s chair.
“You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.” You believe like you haven’t watched them all come and go, <PER>Snape</PER>, hoping you’d be next, thought <PER>Harry</PER> scathingly.
“Is it definite, is he using them?” “The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, “which means you would be well-advised to assume <PER>Snape</PER> might use them again.
<PER>Snape</PER> took <PER>Snape</PER>'s time looking around at everybody else, making sure <PER>Snape</PER> had no choice, before saying curtly, “Very well — Miss Granger?” “Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you’re about to perform,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “which gives you a split-second advantage.” “An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,” said <PER>Snape</PER> dismissively (over in the corner, <PER>Malfoy</PER> sniggered), “but correct in essentials.
<PER>Snape</PER> refused to drop <PER>Snape</PER>'s gaze, but glowered at <PER>Snape</PER> until <PER>Snape</PER> looked away.
Typically, ten minutes into the lesson <PER>Hermione</PER> managed to repel <PER>Neville</PER>’s muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly, but which <PER>Snape</PER> ignored.
<PER>Harry</PER> swept between them as them practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> struggling with the task.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who was supposed to be jinxing <PER>Harry</PER>, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save his from the temptation of muttering the incantation.
<PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.
“Here — let me show you — ” He turned He's wand on <PER>Harry</PER> so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “Protegol” <PER>Harry</PER> Shield Charm was so strong <PER>Snape</PER> was knocked off-balance and hit a desk.
The whole class had looked around and now watched as <PER>Snape</PER> righted <PER>Snape</PER>, scowling.
Behind <PER>Snape</PER>, however, <PER>Ron</PER>, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively.
“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, frowning at <PER>Ron</PER>.
Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, unrolling the parchment as he went.
“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had read the message over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder and was looking perplexed.
<PER>Hermione</PER> said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted to teach <PER>Harry</PER> advanced Defensive magic.
After break, <PER>Hermione</PER> went off to Arithmancy while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> returned to the common room, where they grudgingly started <PER>Snape</PER>’s homework.
This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when <PER>Hermione</PER> joined them for them's after-lunch free period (though <PER>Hermione</PER> considerably speeded up the process).
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” Ernie said portentously, holding out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand as <PER>Harry</PER> approached, “didn’t get a chance to speak in Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons.
This left <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> to share a table with Ernie.
They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents <PER>Harry</PER> had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded <PER>Harry</PER> simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> might have smelled at the Burrow.
<PER>Harry</PER> found that <PER>Harry</PER> was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion’s fumes seemed to be filling <PER>Harry</PER> up like drink.
A great contentment stole over <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> grinned across at <PER>Ron</PER>, who grinned back lazily.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, m’boy?” “I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s <PER>Ron</PER> — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see — ” “Ah, yes, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> did mention not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER> slightly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside his seat.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else’s; Slughorn pointed at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the second cauldron, but did not resent <PER>Hermione</PER> getting the credit for answering the question; <PER>Hermione</PER>, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> looked rather as <PER>Malfoy</PER> had done the time <PER>Hermione</PER> had punched <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the face.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER> with a radiant expression and whispered, “Did you really tell <PER>Harry</PER> I’m the best in the year?
“You are the best in the year — I’d’ve told <PER>Harry</PER> so if him’d asked me!” <PER>Hermione</PER> smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying.
Now all <PER>Harry</PER> could see of <PER>Malfoy</PER> was the back of his sleek blond head, because his was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> riffling feverishly through <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent <PER>Harry</PER>.
To <PER>Harry</PER>'s annoyance <PER>Harry</PER> saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions.
Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) <PER>Harry</PER> hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what <PER>Harry</PER> needed.
As <PER>Harry</PER> dashed back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> cutting up valerian roots as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
Having finished chopping his roots, <PER>Harry</PER> bent low over <PER>Harry</PER>'s book again.
“Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table.
“Yes,” said Slughorn, without looking at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, “I was sorry to hear <PER>Harry</PER> had died, although of course it wasn’t unexpected, dragon pox at <PER>Harry</PER>'s age.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent back over <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron, smirking.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had expected to be treated like <PER>Harry</PER> or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type <PER>Harry</PER> had learned to expect from <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> crushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s bean with the flat side of the dagger.
<PER>Harry</PER> stirred counterclockwise, held <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, and stirred once clockwise.
<PER>Harry</PER> shrugged and continued what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing.
As far as <PER>Harry</PER> could see, no one else’s potion had turned as pale as <PER>Harry</PER>.
At last he reached the table where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Ernie were sitting.
“Got lucky, I suppose,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Malfoy</PER> was within earshot.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent low to retrieve the book, and as <PER>Harry</PER> did so, <PER>Harry</PER> saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.
For the rest of the week’s Potions lessons <PER>Harry</PER> continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince’s instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about <PER>Harry</PER>’s abilities, saying that <PER>Harry</PER> had rarely taught anyone so talented.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> was delighted by this.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> had offered to share <PER>Harry</PER>'s book with both of them, <PER>Ron</PER> had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than <PER>Harry</PER> did, and could not keep asking <PER>Harry</PER> to read aloud or it might look suspicious.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what <PER>Hermione</PER> called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.
Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented <PER>Harry</PER> from reading the whole of <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion-Making, <PER>Harry</PER> had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making.
“Or herself,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> irritably, overhearing <PER>Harry</PER> pointing some of these out to <PER>Ron</PER> in the common room on Saturday evening.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Ooooh!” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking up at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> proceeded through deserted corridors, though <PER>Harry</PER> had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as herself shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as herself walked.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited until <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall.
“Acid Pops,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind the gargoyle slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which <PER>Harry</PER> stepped, so that <PER>Harry</PER> was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
“You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!” “Er,” began <PER>Harry</PER> awkwardly, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not look too stern.
“I have arranged with Professor <PER>Snape</PER> that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who had more pressing matters on his mind than S nape’s detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was planning to do with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> this evening.
The circular office looked just as The circular office always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle- legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching <PER>Harry</PER> with bright interest.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, in a businesslike voice.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> straightened up, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“This time, you enter the Pensieve with me and, even more unusually, with permission.” “Where are we going, sir?” “For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, pulling from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery- white substance.
“Shall — shall I, sir?” “No matter, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand at the bottle and the cork flew out.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged <PER>Harry</PER>'s face into the silvery substance.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet leave the office floor; <PER>Harry</PER> was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, <PER>Harry</PER> was blinking in dazzling sunlight.
Before <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes had adjusted, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> landed beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew this must be Ogden; <PER>Harry</PER> was the only person in sight, and <PER>Harry</PER> was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one- piece bathing costume.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> had time to do more than register <PER>Harry</PER>'s bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> followed.
As <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> passed the wooden sign, <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at its two arms.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> lengthened <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s stride, and <PER>Harry</PER> hurried to keep up.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as <PER>Harry</PER> had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance.
<PER>Harry</PER> soon discovered that <PER>Harry</PER> was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had left behind.
Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand.
As the dark shadows of the trees slid over <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake.
Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast <PER>Harry</PER> stood on the tails of <PER>Harry</PER>'s frock coat and stumbled.
his might have looked comical, but his did not; the effect was frightening, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before <PER>Harry</PER> spoke.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making <PER>Harry</PER> very clear in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion, particularly as <PER>Harry</PER> was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other.
“You understand <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sure, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
her looked a little cleaner than the two men, but <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen a more defeated-looking person.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that <PER>Harry</PER> was showing Ogden the ugly, black- stoned ring <PER>Harry</PER> was wearing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s middle finger, waving it before Ogden’s eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> indicated that they ought to follow and <PER>Harry</PER> obeyed, Merope ’s screams echoing in his ears.
“I think that will do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER> by the elbow and tugged.
“What happened to the girl in the cottage?” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand.
“Merope, or whatever her name was?” “Oh, she survived,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, reseating himself behind himself's desk and indicating that <PER>Harry</PER> should sit down too.
“I am glad to see you’re keeping up.” “That old man was — ?” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s grandfather, yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Yes, that was Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.” “And they ended up married?” <PER>Harry</PER> said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love.
“I think that will do for tonight, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> after a moment or two.
“Sir is it important to know all this about <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s past?” “Very important, I think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Sir, am I allowed to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> everything you’ve told me?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> considered <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a moment, then said, “Yes, I think Arthur and Miss Granger have proved Arthur and Miss Granger trustworthy.
“But isn’t it sir, isn’t it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> bowed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head.
“A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle’s, in fact.” “That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?” “Around that time, yes, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated.
<PER>Harry</PER> barely understood half of what Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said to them these days; even <PER>Hermione</PER> had had to ask <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to repeat instructions once or twice.
Incredibly, and to <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s increasing resentment, <PER>Harry</PER>’s best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.
<PER>Harry</PER> frequently looked over at <PER>Harry</PER>'s classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though them had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that them were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud.
One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had so far been unable to find time to go and visit <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“We’ve got to go and explain,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking up at <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at breakfast.
<PER>Harry</PER> too was missing <PER>Hagrid</PER>, although like <PER>Ron</PER> he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives.
“I dunno why the team’s this popular all of a sudden.” “Oh, come on, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, suddenly impatient.
<PER>Hermione</PER> spared him one look of disdain before turning back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot over the summer either,” <PER>Hermione</PER> finished, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had received no mail since the start of term; <PER>Harry</PER>'s only regular correspondent was now dead and although <PER>Harry</PER> had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, <PER>Harry</PER> had so far been disappointed.
“I’ll give Slughorn back the new one, Slughorn can’t complain, it cost nine Galleons.” <PER>Hermione</PER> pressed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lips together, looking angry and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s carrying that day’s copy of the Daily Prophet.
“Anyone we know dead?” asked <PER>Ron</PER> in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every time <PER>Hermione</PER> opened her paper.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> came to think of it, <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen <PER>Dumbledore</PER> since their private lesson a week ago.
“I think <PER>Harry</PER>’s left the school to do something with the Order,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low voice.
“Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.” “You didn’t try out last year, did you?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that <PER>Harry</PER> would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving.
The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls <PER>Harry</PER> had ever encountered, who, when <PER>Harry</PER> blew <PER>Harry</PER>'s whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another.
After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, <PER>Harry</PER> had found <PER>Harry</PER> three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot.
Pleased though he was with his choices, <PER>Harry</PER> had also shouted <PER>Harry</PER> hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced over at <PER>Ron</PER>, who had always had a problem with nerves; <PER>Harry</PER> had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: <PER>Ron</PER> was a delicate shade of green.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around, expecting to see <PER>Hermione</PER>, but it was Lavender Brown.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have quite liked to have hidden <PER>Harry</PER>'s face in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch <PER>Ron</PER> do his trial.
Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to McLaggen to tell <PER>Harry</PER> that, most unfortunately, <PER>Ron</PER> had beaten <PER>Harry</PER>, only to find McLaggen’s red face inches from his own.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned around to find <PER>Harry</PER>'s new team beaming at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You flew really well — ” “You did brilliantly, <PER>Ron</PER>!” This time it really was <PER>Hermione</PER> running toward them from the stands; <PER>Harry</PER> saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as himself grinned at the team and at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> bade good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt extremely hungry; <PER>Harry</PER> hoped there would be something to eat at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
“How are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> in a low voice, moving forward to stroke the feathery head.
“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast the door open!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, pulling out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding shocked.
“Stand back — ” But before <PER>Harry</PER> could say anything else, the door flew open again as <PER>Harry</PER> had known it would, and there stood <PER>Hagrid</PER>, glowering down at <PER>Harry</PER> and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.
<PER>Hermione</PER> scurried in after <PER>Harry</PER>, looking rather frightened.
“Well?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> grumpily, as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying Fang's head immediately upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s knee and drooling all over his robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> was hungry enough even for <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cooking, and took one at once.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done he a great personal wrong, “we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> gave another great snort.
There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a tiny shriek, and <PER>Ron</PER> leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed.
“What are they, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down <PER>Harry</PER>'s rock cake all the same.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders.
<PER>Harry</PER> had known <PER>Hagrid</PER> to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and <PER>Ron</PER> had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>’s frantic grimaces and head- shakings.
“I don’ think there is, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” choked <PER>Hagrid</PER>, attempting to stem the flood of his tears.
<PER>Ron</PER> merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but <PER>Harry</PER> caught <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s arm and held her back.
“But you should have heard the way he was talking about <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>!
“Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, and they hurried after <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, just the man I was hoping to see!” he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly.
“He’s got no chance of persuading <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot.
“This detention’s already been postponed once; <PER>Snape</PER> did it for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but <PER>Snape</PER> won’t do it for anyone else.” “Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hermione</PER> was thinking about McLaggen.
“I doubt you’ll be alone, <PER>Ginny</PER>’ll probably be invited,” snapped <PER>Ron</PER>, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn.
“Oh, look, your dad’s in here, <PER>Ron</PER> — he’s all right!” she added quickly, for <PER>Ron</PER> had looked around in alarm.
“Can you think of any way <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ?” “Oh, drop it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited <PER>Hermione</PER> and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, firing up.
“Well, as I’m not invited to any parties,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, getting to his feet again, “I think I’ll go to bed.” He stomped off toward the door to the boys’ dormitories, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> staring after <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> rarely appeared at meals anymore, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Hermione</PER> was right in thinking that <PER>Harry</PER> was leaving the school for days at a time.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> forgotten the lessons <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was supposed to be giving <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; <PER>Harry</PER> had felt bolstered, comforted, and now <PER>Harry</PER> felt slightly abandoned.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion- Making.
He did not usually lie in bed reading He's textbooks; that sort of behavior, as <PER>Ron</PER> rightly said, was indecent in anybody except <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was simply weird that way.
The more <PER>Harry</PER> pored over the book, the more <PER>Harry</PER> realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were earning <PER>Harry</PER> such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which <PER>Harry</PER> was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.
There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (<PER>Harry</PER> had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which <PER>Harry</PER> had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard.
The only person who did not find these charms amusing was <PER>Hermione</PER>, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if <PER>Harry</PER> had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity.
There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble: Levicorpus (nvbl) While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and <PER>Neville</PER> snored loudly, <PER>Harry</PER> stared at the letters in brackets.
Nvbl that had to mean “nonverbal.” <PER>Harry</PER> rather doubted <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to bring off this particular spell; <PER>Harry</PER> was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something <PER>Snape</PER> had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A.
<PER>Harry</PER> sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; <PER>Ron</PER> was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.
“Sorry!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and <PER>Neville</PER> picked <PER>Neville</PER> up from the floor, having fallen out of bed.
“Hang on — I’ll let you down — ” He groped for the potion book and riffled through the potion book in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last He located the potion book and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counter-jinx, <PER>Harry</PER> thought Liberacorpus\ with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might.
“Tomorrow,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a muffled voice, “I’d rather you set the alarm clock.” By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Molly’s hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, <PER>Ron</PER>’s shock had subsided and he had decided that <PER>Harry</PER>’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that <PER>Harry</PER> lost no time in regaling <PER>Hermione</PER> with the story as they sat down for breakfast. "
<PER>Hermione</PER> had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> frowned at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And also,” she added, as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> rolled their eyes, “because I’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.” Both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> shouted her down at once.
“Just a laugh, <PER>Hermione</PER>, that’s all!” “Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“I — Lupin told me.” This last part was not true; in fact, <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER>'s father use the spell on <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had never told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about that particular excursion into the Pensieve.
“Maybe your dad did use it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but he’s not the only one.
“If he’d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ would he?” Even as he said it, <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had been pure-blood, but <PER>Harry</PER> pushed the thought out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind; <PER>Harry</PER> would worry about that later.
“Thanks, <PER>Ginny</PER> It’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s next lesson!” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents.
<PER>Harry</PER> wrapped <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarf over <PER>Harry</PER>'s lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb.
More than once <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko’s Joke Shop had been boarded up, <PER>Harry</PER> took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun.
<PER>Ron</PER> pointed, with a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> staggered in his wake into the crowded shop.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed now!” said Slughorn, poking <PER>Harry</PER> genially in the chest.
This strategy meant that <PER>Ron</PER> was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with <PER>Ginny</PER>, imagining <PER>Hermione</PER> shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.
“Ah, well you can’t evade me forever, <PER>Harry</PER>!” And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of <PER>Ron</PER> as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters.
“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shaking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
“Oh, look — They’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those would last hours!” Glad that <PER>Hermione</PER> had changed the subject, <PER>Harry</PER> showed much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than <PER>Harry</PER> would normally have done, but <PER>Ron</PER> continued to look moody and merely shrugged when <PER>Hermione</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> where <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to go next.
As <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms.
Holding <PER>Harry</PER> fast with one hand, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” squealed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I — no — ” “Give it to me!” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you mustn’t!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>, as Mundungus started to turn blue.
There was a bang, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands fly off Mundungus’s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> swore at the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone.
The moment he was inside, <PER>Harry</PER> burst out, “<PER>Harry</PER> was nicking Sirius’s stuff.” “I know, <PER>Harry</PER>, but please don’t shout, people are staring,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Go and sit down, I’ll get you a drink.” <PER>Harry</PER> was still fuming when <PER>Hermione</PER> returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.
“Can’t they at least stop <PER>Harry</PER> stealing everything that’s not fixed down when <PER>Harry</PER>’s at headquarters?” “Shh!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at <PER>Harry</PER> with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’d be annoyed too, I know it’s your things <PER>Harry</PER>’s stealing — ” <PER>Harry</PER> gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, what are you staring at?” “Nothing,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, hastily looking away from the bar, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.
<PER>Harry</PER> was thinking about Sirius, and how <PER>Harry</PER> had hated those silver goblets anyway.
<PER>Hermione</PER> drummed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers on the table, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes flickering between <PER>Ron</PER> and the bar.
The moment <PER>Harry</PER> drained the last drops in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bottle she said, “Shall we call it a day and go back to school, then?” The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts strayed to <PER>Ginny</PER> as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush.
It was a little while before <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to <PER>Harry</PER> on the wind, had become shriller and louder.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katie’s legs, Katie fell on top of them; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> managed to catch Katie's but Katie was writhing so much they could hardly hold Katie.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat.
“Jus’ bin visitin’ Grawp, he’s cornin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ — ” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or something — ” “Wha?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, bending lower to hear what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying over the raging wind.
It took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Leanne were all trying to quiet her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hurried over to Katie’s wailing friend and put an arm around <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> bent down, his hand outstretched, but <PER>Harry</PER> seized his arm and pulled him back.
<PER>Hermione</PER> patted <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoulder gently.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t say who’d given it to <PER>Hermione</PER>, Leanne?” “No Leanne wouldn’t tell me and I said No Leanne was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but No Leanne just wouldn’t listen and and then I tried to grab it from No Leanne's and — and — ” No Leanne let out a wail of despair.
As they followed <PER>Hermione</PER> and Leanne up the road, <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking furiously.
They had just entered the grounds when <PER>Harry</PER> spoke, unable to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts to <PER>Harry</PER> any longer.
“Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes and didn’t that girl say Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?” “She said She came back from the bathroom with it, She didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — ” “<PER>McGonagall</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> warningly.
“Good lord,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Take this necklace to Professor <PER>Snape</PER> at once, but be sure not to touch this necklace, keep this necklace wrapped in the scarf!” <PER>Harry</PER> and the others followed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> upstairs and into her office.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> closed the door and swept around her desk to face <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the still sobbing Leanne.
“All right,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, not unkindly, “go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.” When Leanne had left the room, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> turned back to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What happened when Katie touched the necklace?” “Katie rose up in the air,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, before either <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> could speak, “and then began to scream, and collapsed.
“But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, I’m sure!” For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> did not invite confidences; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild.
“I think <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> gave Katie that necklace, Professor.” On one side of him, <PER>Ron</PER> rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, <PER>Hermione</PER> shuffled <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Do you have any proof?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but ” and <PER>Harry</PER> told her about following <PER>Malfoy</PER> to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Mister Borgin.
“Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> despairingly, “it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it!
“Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> purely because Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased.
<PER>Harry</PER> was angry with the other two for siding with <PER>McGonagall</PER>; nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER> felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> must be one of their top targets.
“Crabbe or Goyle — or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he’ll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up — ” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged looks that plainly said There’s no point arguing with him.
“It wasn’t very well thought-out at all.” “But since when has <PER>Malfoy</PER> been one of the world’s great thinkers?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> answered him.
Katie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that Katie had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target.
“Oh, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> knows, of course,” said <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever <PER>Harry</PER> mentioned his <PER>Malfoy</PER>-Is-a-Death-Eater theory.
<PER>Harry</PER> had wondered whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would return from wherever <PER>Harry</PER> had been in time for Monday night’s lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, <PER>Harry</PER> presented <PER>Harry</PER> outside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s office at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to enter.
There sat <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looking unusually tired; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand was as black and burned as ever, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gestured to <PER>Harry</PER> to sit down.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes, I expect so,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand.
“Sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> tentatively, “I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.” “Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered contempt,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, frowning a little.
“Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, after a short pause, “did Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> tell you what I told Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s after Katie got hurt?
“But what concerns me now, <PER>Harry</PER>, is our lesson.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second?
However, <PER>Harry</PER> said no more about <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but watched as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long-fingered hands.
“You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton.
“Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, “but she had a choice, didn’t she, not like my mother — ” “Your mother had a choice too,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gently.
“Yes, Merope <PER>Riddle</PER> chose death in spite of a son who needed she, but do not judge shis too harshly, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Nice suit, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> merely chuckled as they followed <PER>Harry</PER>'s younger self a short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings.
<PER>Harry</PER> and the older <PER>Dumbledore</PER> followed.
“Good afternoon,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, holding out <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand.
She invited <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to sit on a rickety chair and seated She behind a cluttered desk, eyeing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nervously.
“I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> and arrangements for his future,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Apparently <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thought so too, for <PER>Harry</PER> now saw <PER>Harry</PER> slip <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand out of the pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s velvet suit, at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mistress Cole’s desktop.
Smacking her lips frankly, her smiled at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for the first time, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t hesitate to press <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s advantage.
“You’ll be taking <PER>Dumbledore</PER> away, whatever?” “Whatever,” repeated <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gravely.
She squinted at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as though deciding whether or not to trust <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> drew up the hard wooden chair beside <PER>Riddle</PER>, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.
“I am Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “ ‘Professor?” repeated <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“Hogwarts,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> went on, as though he had not heard <PER>Riddle</PER>’s last words, “is a school for people with special abilities — ” “I’m not mad!” “I know that you are not mad.
<PER>Riddle</PER> had frozen, <PER>Riddle</PER>'s face expressionless, but <PER>Riddle</PER>'s eyes were flickering back and forth between each of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, as though trying to catch one of them lying.
“Are you a wizard too?” “Yes, I am.” “Prove it,” said <PER>Riddle</PER> at once, in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said, “Tell the truth.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyebrows.
To his great surprise, however, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drew <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand from an inside pocket of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick.
<PER>Riddle</PER> jumped to his feet; <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly blame <PER>Harry</PER> for howling in shock and rage; all <PER>Harry</PER>'s worldly possessions must be in there.
But even as <PER>Riddle</PER> rounded on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.
<PER>Riddle</PER> stared from the wardrobe to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; then, <PER>Riddle</PER>'s expression greedy, <PER>Riddle</PER> pointed at the wand.
<PER>Riddle</PER> threw <PER>Dumbledore</PER> a long, clear, calculating look.
<PER>Riddle</PER> took off the lid and tipped the contents onto <PER>Riddle</PER>'s bed without looking at them.
“You will return they to their owners with your apologies,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly, putting <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand back into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s jacket.
When he had finished, he turned to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and said baldly, “I haven’t got any money.” “That is easily remedied,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, drawing a leather money-pouch from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s pocket.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would insist upon accompanying <PER>Riddle</PER>, but once again <PER>Harry</PER> was surprised.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> handed <PER>Riddle</PER> the envelope containing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s list of equipment, and after telling <PER>Riddle</PER> exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “You will be able to see it, although Muggles around you — non-magical people, that is — will not.
“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t have died,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>, more to <PER>Riddle</PER> than <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet and held out <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand again.
“It is unusual,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, after a moment’s hesitation, “but not unheard of.” His tone was casual but His's eyes moved curiously over <PER>Riddle</PER>’s face.
“Sit down,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, landing beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> obeyed, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind still full of what <PER>Harry</PER> had just seen.
“<PER>Harry</PER> believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, when you told <PER>Harry</PER> was a wizard,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I didn’t believe <PER>Hagrid</PER> at first, when <PER>Harry</PER> told me.” “Yes, <PER>Riddle</PER> was perfectly ready to believe that he was — to use his word — ‘special,’ ” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, for <PER>Harry</PER> had come to a halt.
“But I thought you might have the mouth organ or something.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> beamed at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, peering over the top of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s half-moon spectacles.
“Very astute, <PER>Harry</PER>, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ.” And on that enigmatic note he waved to <PER>Harry</PER>, who understood himself to be dismissed.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been unable to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about <PER>Harry</PER>'s lesson with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but <PER>Harry</PER> filled them in as them walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.
“Wow, scary thought, the boy <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this term’s project, and began pulling on their protective gloves.
“But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says it’s all important and it’ll help me survive.” “I think it’s fascinating,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> earnestly.
“You’re lagging behind, everybody else has started, and <PER>Neville</PER>’s already got <PER>Neville</PER>’s's first pod!” They looked around; sure enough, there sat <PER>Neville</PER> with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of <PER>Neville</PER>'s face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.
“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, adding quietly, when she had turned away again, “should’ve used Muffliato, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “No, we shouldn’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once, looking, as <PER>Hermione</PER> always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his spells.
One tangled itself in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hair, and <PER>Ron</PER> beat it back with a pair of secateurs; <PER>Harry</PER> succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; <PER>Hermione</PER> plunged <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and <PER>Hermione</PER> snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like <PER>Neville</PER>’s.
“Pass me a bowl,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, holding the pulsating pod at arm’s length; <PER>Harry</PER> handed one over and <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped the pulsating pod into it with a look of disgust on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“Anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to have a Christmas party, <PER>Harry</PER>, and there’s no way you’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.” <PER>Harry</PER> groaned.
Meanwhile, <PER>Ron</PER>, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, “And this is another party just for Slughorn’s favorites, is it?” “Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to retrieve The pod; when <PER>Harry</PER> got back, <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying, “Look, !
“Reparo,” <PER>Harry</PER> said hastily, poking the pieces with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and the bowl sprang back together again.
The crash, however, appeared to have awoken <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>’s presence.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for <PER>Hermione</PER>'s copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; <PER>Ron</PER>, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.
“Hand that over, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hurriedly.
It was not as though he was really surprised, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure how <PER>Harry</PER> felt about it.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER> were now too embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> started going out together, then split up?
Could <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER>'s friendship survive it?
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; <PER>Harry</PER> had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between they.
“Gotcha!” yelled <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling a second pod from the stump just as <PER>Hermione</PER> managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER>'s two friends more closely over the next few days, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual.
<PER>Harry</PER> supposed <PER>Harry</PER> would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn’s dimly lit room on the night of the party.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not think <PER>Harry</PER> could stand another full- House tryout.
Over Dean’s shoulder, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Seamus Finnigan slamming <PER>Harry</PER>'s books into Seamus Finnigan's bag, looking sour.
One of the reasons why <PER>Harry</PER> would have preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that <PER>Harry</PER> knew Seamus would not like it.
There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> had now chosen two of <PER>Harry</PER>'s classmates for the team.
As <PER>Harry</PER> had endured much worse mutterings than this in <PER>Harry</PER>'s school career, <PER>Harry</PER> was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin.
If Gryffindor won, <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized <PER>Harry</PER> and swear that they had always known it was a great team.
If they lost well, <PER>Harry</PER> thought wryly, <PER>Harry</PER> had still endured worse mutterings.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no reason to regret <PER>Harry</PER>'s choice once <PER>Harry</PER> saw Dean fly that evening; <PER>Harry</PER> worked well with <PER>Ginny</PER> and Demelza.
<PER>Harry</PER> had known all along that <PER>Ron</PER> was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all <PER>Harry</PER>'s old insecurities.
“You prat, <PER>Ron</PER>, look at the state of her!” “I can fix that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelza’s mouth, and saying “Episkey.” “And <PER>Ginny</PER>, don’t call <PER>Ron</PER> a prat, you’re not the Captain of this team — ” “Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should — ” <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> not to laugh.
“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind <PER>Ginny</PER>.
When <PER>Harry</PER> pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, their found their looking at Dean and <PER>Ginny</PER>, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together.
It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach, clawing at <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides: Hot blood seemed to flood <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly.
Dean gave <PER>Harry</PER> a shifty grin that <PER>Harry</PER> did not return, as the newborn monster inside <PER>Harry</PER> was roaring for Dean’s instant dismissal from the team.
“Right,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at <PER>Ron</PER>, “let’s get this straight once and for all.
“D’you think I want people saying my sister’s a — ” “A what?” shouted <PER>Ginny</PER>, drawing <PER>Ginny</PER>'s wand.
“A what, exactly?” “He doesn’t mean anything, <PER>Ginny</PER> — ” said <PER>Harry</PER> automatically, though the monster was roaring its approval of <PER>Ron</PER>’s words.
“No, I will not!” yelled <PER>Ginny</PER>, beside <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” <PER>Ron</PER> roared, trying to get a clear shot at <PER>Ginny</PER> around <PER>Harry</PER>, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched.
“Just because I don’t do it in public — !” <PER>Ginny</PER> screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push <PER>Harry</PER> out of the way.
“Don’t be stupid — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>’s snogged <PER>Cho</PER> Chang!” shouted <PER>Ginny</PER>, who sounded close to tears now.
“And <PER>Hermione</PER> snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something disgusting, <PER>Ron</PER>, and that’s because you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!” And with that, she stormed away.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly let go of <PER>Ron</PER>; the look on his face was murderous.
<PER>Harry</PER> hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; <PER>Harry</PER> felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this.
The monster in his chest purred but then his saw <PER>Ron</PER> ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on <PER>Harry</PER>, shouting things like “betrayal of trust” “supposed to be my friend” “D’you think <PER>Hermione</PER> did snog Krum?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave a guilty start and wrenched <PER>Harry</PER>'s imagination away from a corridor in which no <PER>Ron</PER> intruded, in which <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> were quite alone — “What?” <PER>Harry</PER> said confusedly.
However, <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to gather the worst from the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
Neither of they mentioned <PER>Ginny</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster and trying to convince <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings for <PER>Ginny</PER> were entirely elder- brotherly.
She’s <PER>Ron</PER>’s sister, <PER>Harry</PER> told himself firmly.
<PER>Harry</PER> awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which <PER>Ron</PER> had chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday <PER>Harry</PER> would have happily exchanged the dream <PER>Ron</PER> for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered <PER>Hermione</PER> with an icy, sneering indifference.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent the day attempting to keep the peace between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> with no success; finally, <PER>Hermione</PER> departed for bed in high dudgeon, and <PER>Ron</PER> stalked off to the boys’ dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s dismay, <PER>Ron</PER>’s new aggression did not wear off over the next few days.
“ENOUGH!” bellowed <PER>Harry</PER>, who had seen <PER>Ginny</PER> glowering in <PER>Ron</PER>’s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat- Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand.
Nothing <PER>Harry</PER> tried boosting <PER>Ron</PER>’s confidence all through dinner, but <PER>Ron</PER> was too busy being grumpy and surly with <PER>Hermione</PER> to notice.
<PER>Harry</PER> persisted in the common room that evening, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s assertion that the whole team would be devastated if <PER>Ron</PER> left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about <PER>Ron</PER> and casting <PER>Harry</PER> nasty looks.
Finally <PER>Harry</PER> tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking <PER>Ron</PER> into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; <PER>Ron</PER> went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it <PER>Harry</PER>'s first as Captain, but <PER>Harry</PER> was determined to beat <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> at Quidditch even if <PER>Harry</PER> could not yet prove <PER>Harry</PER>'s suspicions about <PER>Harry</PER>.
If only there was something he could do to make <PER>Ron</PER> pull himself together make him play at the top of himself's form something that would ensure that <PER>Ron</PER> had a really good day.
The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> approached.
<PER>Harry</PER> grinned and waved; <PER>Ron</PER> grimaced weakly and shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
A few minutes later <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had become so tired of <PER>Ron</PER>’s recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on shis way up the table.
“Fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who was concentrating on handing <PER>Ron</PER> a glass of pumpkin juice.
“Don’t drink that, <PER>Ron</PER>!” Both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked up at her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Hermione</PER> could not believe <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, I warn you, don’t drink it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said again, alarmed, but <PER>Ron</PER> picked up the glass, drained the glass in one gulp, and said, “Stop bossing me around, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked scandalized.
“Pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> and Demelza were already wearing <PER>Ginny</PER> and Demelza's Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room.
“Conditions look ideal,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
“They’re playing Harper instead; Harper’s in my year and Harper’s an idiot.” <PER>Harry</PER> smiled back vaguely, but as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> had once before claimed <PER>Malfoy</PER> could not play due to injury, but on that occasion <PER>Malfoy</PER> had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> not playing?” “Lucky, I call it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking slightly more animated.
“My drink my pumpkin juice you didn’t ?” <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyebrows, but said nothing except, “Well be starting in about five minutes, you’d better get your boots on.” They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos.
“Captains shake hands,” she said, and <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart.
<PER>Harry</PER> soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> craned around on <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom to look toward the commentator’s podium.
With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, <PER>Ron</PER> having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and <PER>Ginny</PER> having scored four of Gryffindor’s six goals.
This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because <PER>Harry</PER> liked them, and <PER>Harry</PER> started on Peakes and Coote instead.
“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a Beater,” said Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a bit more muscle — ” “Hit a Bludger at Coote!” <PER>Harry</PER> called to Coote as <PER>Harry</PER> zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing <PER>Harry</PER> in the opposite direction.
“Thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?” said a snide voice, and <PER>Harry</PER> was nearly knocked off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom as Harper collided with <PER>Harry</PER> hard and deliberately.
<PER>Harry</PER> shoulder aching, <PER>Harry</PER> raced after <PER>Harry</PER>, determined to ram <PER>Harry</PER> back .
But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky — Smith was right and <PER>Harry</PER> was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at random; Harper had spotted what <PER>Harry</PER> had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.
<PER>Harry</PER> accelerated; the wind was whistling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears so that it drowned all sound of Smith’s commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of Harper, and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost and now Harper was feet from it, Harper's hand outstretched.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, where ’re you going?” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team, but <PER>Ginny</PER> sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, <PER>Ginny</PER> collided with the commentator’s podium.
As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring; <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ginny</PER> saying blithely to an irate Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.” Laughing, <PER>Harry</PER> broke free of the rest of the team and hugged <PER>Ginny</PER>, but let go very quickly.
“C’mon, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Demelza!” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> were the last two in the changing room.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was twisting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Gryffindor scarf in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands and looked upset but determined.
“What are you two talking about?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, turning away to hang up <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes so that neither of them would see <PER>Harry</PER> grinning.
“Yes you did, <PER>Harry</PER>, and that’s why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing and <PER>Ron</PER> saved everything!” “I didn’t put it in!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning broadly.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that <PER>Hermione</PER> had seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand that morning.
“I wanted <PER>Ron</PER> to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.” He looked at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on <PER>Hermione</PER>, imitating her voice.
“Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER> into the sudden silence; <PER>Harry</PER> had not expected <PER>Harry</PER>'s plan to backfire like this, “shall shall we go up to the party, then?” “You go!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, blinking back tears.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great sense of letdown; <PER>Harry</PER> had been sure that if <PER>Ron</PER> won the match, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would be friends again immediately.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not see how <PER>Harry</PER> could possibly explain to <PER>Hermione</PER> that what <PER>Hermione</PER> had done to offend <PER>Ron</PER> was kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred so long ago.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see <PER>Hermione</PER> at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when <PER>Harry</PER> arrived.
Renewed cheers and clapping greeted <PER>Harry</PER>'s appearance, and <PER>Harry</PER> was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating <PER>Harry</PER>.
What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled <PER>Harry</PER>, laughing at <PER>Harry</PER>'s least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned away from <PER>Ron</PER>, who did not look like <PER>Harry</PER> would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing.
With a sinking feeling, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight.
He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed <PER>Ron</PER>, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “<PER>Ron</PER> seems to be enjoying the celebrations.” “Er does he?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Don’t pretend you didn’t see <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s horror, <PER>Ron</PER> came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.
“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was staring at <PER>Ron</PER>, who refused to look at <PER>Hermione</PER>, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, “Hi, <PER>Harry</PER>!
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> spun around to see <PER>Hermione</PER> pointing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at <PER>Ron</PER>, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward <PER>Ron</PER>, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh the birds could reach.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard a sob before it slammed.
Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time <PER>Harry</PER> went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however, <PER>Harry</PER>’s frequent nighttime wanderings had given <PER>Harry</PER> an unusually good knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that <PER>Harry</PER> was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> much preferred this new laughing, joking <PER>Ron</PER> to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved <PER>Ron</PER> came at a heavy price.
Firstly, <PER>Harry</PER> had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing <PER>Ron</PER> as a moment wasted; and secondly, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again.
<PER>Ron</PER>, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone.
Determined as he was to remain friends with both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight.
“I never promised <PER>Hermione</PER> anything,” <PER>Ron</PER> mumbled.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s voice tailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> caught the words “Krum” and “can’t complain” again.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s schedule was so full that <PER>Harry</PER> could only talk to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s properly in the evenings, when <PER>Ron</PER> was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> refused to sit in the common room while <PER>Ron</PER> was there, so <PER>Harry</PER> generally joined <PER>Hermione</PER>'s in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice might soon vanish from lack of use.
“And incidentally,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, after a few moments, “you need to be careful.” “For the last time,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, speaking in a slightly hoarse whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence, “I am not giving back this book, I’ve learned more from the Half-Blood Prince than <PER>Snape</PER> or Slughorn have taught me in — ” “I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hitched up the long roll of parchment on which <PER>Hermione</PER> was writing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s quill.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Hermione</PER>'s with <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind a long way away.
“I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” “And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, still concentrating on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s essay.
“It’s part of all the owls's Owl Order Service.” “You know a lot about it.” <PER>Hermione</PER> gave him the kind of nasty look <PER>Hermione</PER> had just given him's copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
“ — so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a cough potion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead; <PER>Harry</PER> had heard it too.
“Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct — what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?” “It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily, snatching <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand.
She looked as though She might have a seizure; <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had hastily packed Shis things, grabbed <PER>Harry</PER> by the arm and frogmarched <PER>Harry</PER> away.
“Sooner you ask someone, sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you can — ” But <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face suddenly turned blank; <PER>Hermione</PER> had just spotted <PER>Ron</PER> and Lavender, who were entwined in the same armchair.
“Well, good night, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though it was only seven o’clock in the evening, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left for the girls’ dormitory without another word.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to bed comforting <PER>Harry</PER> that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn’s party, after which he and <PER>Ron</PER> would depart together for the Burrow.
It now seemed impossible that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of them's behavior .
<PER>Hermione</PER> laughed unkindly at <PER>Ron</PER>’s disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give he a spectacular handlebar mustache; <PER>Ron</PER> retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of <PER>Hermione</PER> jumping up and down in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s seat every time Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced <PER>Hermione</PER> to the verge of tears again.
She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half Shis things behind; <PER>Harry</PER>, deciding that Shis need was greater than <PER>Ron</PER>’s just now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her.
“Oh yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a choked voice, taking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that <PER>Hermione</PER> was wiping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s pencil case.
“Anyonel And you chose Loony Lovegood?” “Don’t call her that, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Ginny</PER>, pausing behind <PER>Harry</PER> on her way to join friends.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to feel pleased that <PER>Ginny</PER> was glad <PER>Harry</PER> was taking Luna to the party, but could not quite manage it.
A long way along the table, <PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting alone, playing with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s stew.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed <PER>Ron</PER> looking at her furtively.
Squeezing her in between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, Lavender flung her arms around <PER>Ron</PER>’s neck.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at <PER>Hermione</PER> in Transfiguration.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw that <PER>Hermione</PER> was beaming back, if possible even more brightly.
“Hi, Parvati!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER> and Lavender completely.
<PER>Hermione</PER> acted as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had not seen or heard anything.
“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with a most un-<PER>Hermione</PER>-ish giggle.
When <PER>Harry</PER> arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night, <PER>Harry</PER> found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at <PER>Harry</PER> resentfully as <PER>Harry</PER> approached Luna.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna had squeezed in through the door.
Gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so tightly <PER>Harry</PER> might have been hoping to Disapparate with <PER>Harry</PER>, Slughorn led <PER>Harry</PER> purposefully into the party; <PER>Harry</PER> seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend Sanguini.” Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
“I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, ‘Where is the biography of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter for which we have all been waiting?’ ” “Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “were you?” “Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple.
“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea — ” “I’m definitely not interested,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, “and I’ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled Luna after <PER>Harry</PER> into the crowd; <PER>Harry</PER> had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters.
“I thought he’d annoy <PER>Ron</PER> most,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> dispassionately.
Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, <PER>Harry</PER> drew closer to <PER>Hermione</PER> and said, “Let’s get something straight.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, if you can ask out McLaggen — ” “There’s a difference,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with dignity.
“I’ve got no plans to tell <PER>Ron</PER> anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.” “Good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> fervently.
“Because <PER>Harry</PER>’ll just fall apart again, and we’ll lose the next match — ” “Quidditch!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily.
“No, sorry,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> turned quickly to join in Luna’s conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.
“You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death — never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think even you, Severus — ” “Really?” said <PER>Snape</PER> quietly, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes still boring into <PER>Harry</PER>, who felt a certain disquiet.
Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, his saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.
And why was <PER>Snape</PER> looking at <PER>Malfoy</PER> as though both angry and was it possible?
But almost before <PER>Harry</PER> had registered what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath; <PER>Malfoy</PER> had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and <PER>Snape</PER>’s face was smoothly inscrutable again.
It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; him had watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> do that to <PER>Snape</PER> for a long time.
This was the first time he had seen <PER>Malfoy</PER> close up for ages; he now saw that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin.
“I’d like a word with you, <PER>Draco</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER> suddenly.
“Follow me, <PER>Draco</PER>.” They left, <PER>Snape</PER> leading the way, <PER>Malfoy</PER> looking resentful.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, “I’ll be back in a bit, Luna — er — bathroom.” “All right,” she said cheerfully, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard she, as <PER>Harry</PER> hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested.
What was more difficult was finding <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran down the corridor, the noise of <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn ’s office behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
Perhaps <PER>Snape</PER> had taken <PER>Malfoy</PER> to <PER>Snape</PER>'s office in the dungeons or perhaps <PER>Snape</PER> was escorting <PER>Snape</PER> back to the Slytherin common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear against door after door as <PER>Harry</PER> dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, <PER>Harry</PER> crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. "
What had happened to make <PER>Malfoy</PER> speak to <PER>Snape</PER> like this — <PER>Snape</PER>, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?
Then <PER>Snape</PER> said, “You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things.” “You’d better stop telling me to come to your office then!” “Listen to me,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, his voice so low now that <PER>Harry</PER> had to push <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear very hard against the keyhole to hear.
Hardly daring to breathe, <PER>Harry</PER> remained crouched down as <PER>Snape</PER> emerged slowly from the classroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> expression unfathomable, <PER>Harry</PER> returned to the party.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained on the floor, hidden beneath the cloak, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind racing.
“So <PER>Snape</PER> was offering to help <PER>Snape</PER>?
“Yes, <PER>Snape</PER> was offering to help himl” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He said He’d promised <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s mother to protect him, that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something — “An Unbreakable Vow?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking stunned.
“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, <PER>Ron</PER>ald,” said George, “what is this we hear from <PER>Ginny</PER> about you and a young lady called — unless our information is faulty — Lavender Brown?” <PER>Ron</PER> turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts.
“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the attic, and if Fleur shares with <PER>Ginny</PER> — ” “ — that’ll make <PER>Ginny</PER>’s Christmas — ” muttered Fred.
“I promised <PER>Dumbledore</PER> I wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here.” “Oh yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> peeled a few more sprouts and then said, “Are you going to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what you heard <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> saying to each other?” “Yep,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No one’s that good an actor, not even <PER>Snape</PER>.” “Yeah I’m just saying, though,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to him's new evidence; him could hear <PER>Hermione</PER> now: Obviously, <PER>Harry</PER>, him was pretending to offer help so him could trick <PER>Malfoy</PER> into telling him what him’s doing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had disappeared from Slughorn’s parry before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room.
Still, even <PER>Hermione</PER> would not be able to deny one thing: <PER>Malfoy</PER> was definitely up to something, and <PER>Snape</PER> knew it, so <PER>Harry</PER> felt fully justified in saying “I told you so,” which <PER>Harry</PER> had done several times to <PER>Ron</PER> already.
Fred, George, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as Fred pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted to say; as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> marshaled <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called “You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.” “Arthur, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?” “I checked, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Arthur at once.
It’s left me for a spell “Has it occurred to you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Arthur, “that <PER>Snape</PER> was simply pretending — ?” “Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s up to?” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, I am speaking the truth,” he added, as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled a skeptical expression.
<PER>Harry</PER>, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had reminded <PER>Harry</PER> that there was something <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half- Blood Prince?” “The Half-Blood what?” “Prince,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching <PER>Harry</PER> closely for signs of recognition.
“I saw <PER>Harry</PER> in the Pensieve, <PER>Harry</PER> used it on <PER>Snape</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure <PER>Harry</PER> had achieved the right effect; Lupin’s smile was a little too understanding.
“Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “but <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t the only one.
“Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.” He looked into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and then said quietly, “James was a pureblood, <PER>Harry</PER>, and I promise you, James never asked us to call James ‘Prince.’ ” Abandoning pretense, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “And it wasn’t Sirius?
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> climbed all the way up to <PER>Ron</PER>’s attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> fell asleep almost immediately, but <PER>Harry</PER> delved into <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed.
There <PER>Harry</PER> turned its pages, searching, until <PER>Harry</PER> finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published.
Feeling disappointed, <PER>Harry</PER> threw the book back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and <PER>Snape</PER>, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children.
He hesitated a moment, then said, “Is <PER>Hermione</PER> really going out with McLaggen?” “I dunno,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> would,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“But let’s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.” A moment later, <PER>Harry</PER> had given a loud yell and leapt out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.
“Very thoughtful.” “I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, which sobered <PER>Ron</PER> up at once.
“Parsnips, Remus?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; “<PER>Harry</PER> felt goose bumps erupt up “<PER>Harry</PER>'s neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.
<PER>Harry</PER> guessed that <PER>Harry</PER> had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house.
Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know <PER>Harry</PER>’s name convincing, or find it natural that <PER>Harry</PER> should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when <PER>Ginny</PER>, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up Percy's family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to <PER>Harry</PER> alone.
“Wonderful!” said Scrimgeour, standing back to let <PER>Harry</PER> pass through the door ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Percy had, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, been Head of the Auror office; <PER>Harry</PER> looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bowler hat.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that Scrimgeour was watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted all these whispers of a prophecy of you being ‘the <PER>Cho</PER>sen One’” They were getting near it now, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here. "
I assume that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has discussed these matters with you?” <PER>Harry</PER> deliberated, wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> ought to lie or not.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see, out of the corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye, Scrimgeour squinting at <PER>Harry</PER>, so <PER>Harry</PER> pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron.
“And what has <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Sorry, but that’s between us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
He kept He's voice as pleasant as He could, and Scrimgeour’s tone, too, was light and friendly as He said, “Oh, of course, if it’s a question of confidences, I wouldn’t want you to divulge no, no and in any case, does it really matter whether you are ‘the <PER>Cho</PER>sen One’ or not?” ” <PER>Harry</PER> had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding.
The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and <PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes fixed upon it.
<PER>Harry</PER> was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to the gnome, “Funny little chaps, aren’t they?
“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, “you’d like to give the impression that I’m working for the Ministry?” “It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that <PER>Harry</PER> had cottoned on so quickly.
“Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the Ministry!” “Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck people in prison,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper rising now.
There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER> had forced Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER> to carve into Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s own flesh: !
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s man through and through, aren’t you, Potter?” “Yeah, I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts.
“Don’t cry, Mum,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, patting <PER>Ginny</PER>'s on the back as Molly sobbed into Molly's shoulder.
When <PER>Ginny</PER> had arrived, all three of them trooped out of <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s office and off toward Gryffindor Tower.
In the distance, <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> feeding Buckbeak in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin.
“Did you have a good Christmas?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER> at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim — ” “I’ve got something for you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, neither looking at <PER>Ron</PER> nor giving any sign that she had heard him.
“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, rolling <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes as <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way into the packed common room.
Leaving <PER>Ron</PER> and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match, <PER>Harry</PER> led <PER>Hermione</PER> over to the spare table.
“Look, <PER>Hermione</PER>, can’t you — ?” “No, I can’t,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said flatly.
When he had finished, <PER>Hermione</PER> sat in thought for a moment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?” “ — he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick <PER>Malfoy</PER> into telling he what he’s doing?” “Well, yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad and Lupin think so,” <PER>Harry</PER> said grudgingly.
“And he’s acting on <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s orders, just like I said!” “Hmm did either of them actually mention <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name?” <PER>Harry</PER> frowned, trying to remember.
“I’m not sure <PER>Snape</PER> definitely said your master,’ and who else would that be?” “I don’t know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, biting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip.
“How’s Lupin?” “Not great,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> told her all about Lupin’s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing.
“Unless “Oh, come on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in exasperation, “you can’t get round this one!” “Well there is the possibility it was an empty threat.” “You’re unbelievable, you are,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom.
<PER>Ron</PER> was just taking out his quill to sign after <PER>Hermione</PER> when Lavender crept up behind him, slipped Lavender's hands over him's eyes, and trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” <PER>Harry</PER> turned to see <PER>Hermione</PER> stalking off; <PER>Harry</PER> caught up with <PER>Hermione</PER>, having no wish to stay behind with <PER>Ron</PER> and Lavender, but to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surprise, <PER>Ron</PER> caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled.
Without a word, <PER>Hermione</PER> sped up to walk with <PER>Neville</PER>.
“So — Apparition,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his tone making it perfectly plain that <PER>Harry</PER> was not to mention what had just happened.
“Fred and George did.” “Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?” “Yeah, but “Charlie’s bigger than me” — <PER>Ron</PER> held his arms out from — <PER>Ron</PER>'s body as though he was a gorilla — “so Fred and George didn’t go on about it much not to his face anyway ” “When can we take the actual test?” “Soon as we’re seventeen.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s already Apparated,” <PER>Ron</PER> told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of himself's wand and set Seamus lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.” “Dum — er — someone took him.
All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when <PER>Harry</PER> told All of them how uncomfortable it was, and <PER>Harry</PER> was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to lie and say that <PER>Harry</PER> needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for <PER>Harry</PER>'s lesson with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
It did not seem to have healed at all and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said that <PER>Harry</PER> would know eventually and there was, in any case, another subject <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to discuss.
But before <PER>Harry</PER> could say anything about <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke.
“After <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” “I told <PER>Cornelius</PER> there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when <PER>Cornelius</PER> left office.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s intense embarrassment, <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own knees.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke, however, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s voice was quite steady.
“I am very touched, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you’re not at Hogwarts,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still looking fixedly at his knees.
“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now sounding cheerful, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought it safe to look up again.
“It’s about <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.” “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Yes, sir.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished <PER>Harry</PER> did not speak for a few moments, then said, “Thank you for telling me this, <PER>Harry</PER>, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind.
“Professor, did you understand — ?” “Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, a little sharply.
Did this mean that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had indeed ordered <PER>Snape</PER> to find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was doing, in which case he had already heard everything <PER>Harry</PER> had just told him from <PER>Snape</PER>?
“So, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in what <PER>Harry</PER> hoped was a polite, calm voice, “you definitely still trust — ?” “I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not sound very tolerant anymore.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ignored <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
As though he had read <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head.
“I have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of both is, I think, the most important I have collected.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not say anything to this; <PER>Harry</PER> still felt angry at the reception <PER>Harry</PER>'s confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further.
“So,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, in a ringing voice, “we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER> was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered for a moment whether <PER>Harry</PER> was dead.
There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy <PER>Harry</PER> recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and handsome — the teenage <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“ Who are you, then?” “I’m Morfin, ain’t 1?” “ Marvolo’ s son?” “ ’Course I am, then ” Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see <PER>Riddle</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> wore Marvolo’s black-stoned ring on his right hand.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was gazing at Morfin as though appraising <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s possibilities.
Now <PER>Voldemort</PER> moved a little closer and said, “<PER>Riddle</PER> came back?” “Ar, <PER>Voldemort</PER> left her, and serve her right, marrying filth\” said Morfin, spitting on the floor again.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s fingers closed tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and they were soaring back into the present again.
The soft golden light in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office seemed to dazzle <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes after that impenetrable darkness.
“Why did it go dark, what happened?” “Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, gesturing <PER>Harry</PER> back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
“When <PER>Harry</PER> awoke next morning, <PER>Harry</PER> was lying on the floor, quite alone.
“So if you’re underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard’s house, the Ministry won’t know?” “They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing but the face of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who was standing beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Harry</PER> had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.
“Time to go.” And <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the mg in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said that this was the most important memory of all, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could not see what was so significant about it.
“As you might have noticed,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, reseating himself behind his desk, “that memory has been tampered with.” “Tampered with?” repeated <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting back down too.
“Good night, sir.” As he closed the study door behind he, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, “I can’t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry.
The next day <PER>Harry</PER> confided in both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the task that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had set him, though separately, for <PER>Hermione</PER> still refused to remain in <PER>Ron</PER>’s presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look.
<PER>Ron</PER> thought that <PER>Harry</PER> was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all.
“After all, when has Won- Won’s judgment ever been faulty?” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, can’t you — ?” “iVo!” she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> alone and ankle-deep in snow.
Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had to share a desk.
Today, <PER>Hermione</PER> moved <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cauldron around the table so that <PER>Hermione</PER> was close to Ernie, and ignored both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What’ve you done?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s haughty profile.
which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion’s ingredients by Scarpin’s Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that added component that will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements — ” <PER>Ron</PER> was sitting beside <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth half open, doodling absently on <PER>Harry</PER>'s new copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
<PER>Ron</PER> kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on <PER>Hermione</PER> to help he out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on. "
He glanced around at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything <PER>Harry</PER> had done.
“You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s trusty copy of Advanced Potion- Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now waving <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand enthusiastically over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cauldron.
Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell <PER>Hermione</PER> was doing because <PER>Hermione</PER> was now so good at nonverbal incantations that <PER>Hermione</PER> did not need to say the words aloud.
Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, “Specialis Reveliol” over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hastened to imitate him.
It took <PER>Harry</PER> only five minutes to realize that <PER>Harry</PER>'s reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s expression could not have been any smugger; <PER>Hermione</PER> had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s poison into ten different crystal phials.
“A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.” It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had <PER>Snape</PER> still been their teacher, <PER>Harry</PER> would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures.
<PER>Harry</PER> hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged within the store cupboard, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until <PER>Harry</PER> found, at the very back, a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized one, put the box back in the cupboard, and hurried back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron.
Nobody had finished the task, although <PER>Hermione</PER> was trying to cram a few more ingredients into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bottle before Slughorn reached her.
“What have you got to show me?” <PER>Harry</PER> held out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, the bezoar sitting on <PER>Harry</PER>'s palm.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered, for a moment, whether <PER>Harry</PER> was going to shout at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> threw back <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and roared with laughter.
“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed.
“Come on, now, <PER>Harry</PER>, you’ll be late for your next lesson,” said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on <PER>Harry</PER>'s dragon- skin briefcase.
“Sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, reminding himself irresistibly of <PER>Voldemort</PER>, “I wanted to ask you something.” “Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> was at all sympathetic when <PER>Harry</PER> told them of this disastrous interview.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was still seething at the way <PER>Harry</PER> had triumphed without doing the work properly.
<PER>Ron</PER> was resentful that <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too.
Infuriated by him's failure and by <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s attitudes, <PER>Harry</PER> brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn.
<PER>Harry</PER> decided that, for the time being, <PER>Harry</PER> would let Slughorn think that <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack.
When <PER>Harry</PER> did not question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual affectionate treatment of <PER>Harry</PER>, and appeared to have put the matter from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
<PER>Harry</PER> awaited an invitation to one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if <PER>Harry</PER> had to reschedule Quidditch practice.
<PER>Harry</PER> checked with <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>: Neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as them knew, had anybody else.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as <PER>Harry</PER> appeared, simply determined to give <PER>Harry</PER> no additional opportunities to question <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was so shocked, <PER>Hermione</PER> even forgot that <PER>Hermione</PER> was annoyed at <PER>Harry</PER> for <PER>Harry</PER>'s trick with the bezoar.
When <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived in the Hall (<PER>Ron</PER> had come down with Lavender), they found that the tables had disappeared.
Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as them assembled in front of Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout — the Heads of Houses — and a small wizard whom <PER>Harry</PER> took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished <PER>Harry</PER>'s substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> had flushed a dull pink; <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked furious as <PER>Malfoy</PER> stepped away from Crabbe, with whom <PER>Malfoy</PER> appeared to have been having a whispered argument.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced quickly at <PER>Snape</PER>, who also looked annoyed, though <PER>Harry</PER> strongly suspected that this was less because of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s rudeness than the fact that <PER>McGonagall</PER> had reprimanded one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s House.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, where are you going?” demanded <PER>Hermione</PER>.
But <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer; <PER>Harry</PER> was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, <PER>Harry</PER> managed to position <PER>Harry</PER> right at the back of the crowd, directly behind <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous.
“I don’t know how much longer, all right?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> shot at him, oblivious to <PER>Harry</PER> standing right behind him.
“Look, it’s none of your business what I’m doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you’re told and keep a lookout!” “I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want my friends to keep a lookout for me,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, just loud enough for <PER>Malfoy</PER> to hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> spun around on the spot, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hand flying to <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand, but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, “Quiet!” and silence fell again.
<PER>Harry</PER> gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by <PER>Harry</PER>'s hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else.
This proved impossible, as <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stop puzzling over what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was doing that needed lookouts.
<PER>Harry</PER> bit back a laugh and hastily returned <PER>Harry</PER>'s gaze to <PER>Harry</PER>'s own hoop.
“— two — ” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to fix <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts on <PER>Harry</PER>'s hoop again; <PER>Harry</PER> had already forgotten what the three D’s stood for.
The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; <PER>Neville</PER> was flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until his caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at Dean Thomas.
“How did you do?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, hurrying toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glancing over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder to see where <PER>Malfoy</PER> was, and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall.
They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until They set fire to They's own pants, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> simply turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts.
“Up here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys’ staircase.
<PER>Harry</PER> flung open <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and began to rummage in it, while <PER>Ron</PER> watched impatiently.
“<PER>Harry</PER> ” “<PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts.
“Help me find <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> urgently.
<PER>Harry</PER> laid the map upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned over it, searching.
“And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he’s — ” he broke off as <PER>Neville</PER> entered the dormitory, bringing with <PER>Neville</PER> a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in <PER>Neville</PER>'s trunk for a fresh pair of pants.
Despite his determination to catch <PER>Malfoy</PER> out, <PER>Harry</PER> had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> consulted the map as often as <PER>Harry</PER> could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, <PER>Harry</PER> did not once see <PER>Malfoy</PER> anywhere suspicious.
Admittedly, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times <PER>Malfoy</PER> was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> toyed with the possibility that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how <PER>Harry</PER> could be doing it, given the very high level of security now operating within the castle.
<PER>Harry</PER> could only suppose that <PER>Harry</PER> was missing <PER>Malfoy</PER> amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map.
As for the fact that <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle appeared to be going Crabbe, and Goyle's different ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older — <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> reflected sadly, were living proof.
“Happy birthday, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast.
“Have a present.” He threw the package across onto <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed, where the package joined a small pile of them that must, <PER>Harry</PER> assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night.
“Cheers,” said <PER>Ron</PER> drowsily and, as he ripped off the paper, <PER>Harry</PER> got out of bed, opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s own trunk, and began rummaging in it for the Marauder’s Map, which <PER>Harry</PER> hid after every use.
<PER>Harry</PER> turfed out half the contents of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk before <PER>Harry</PER> found half the contents of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which <PER>Harry</PER> was still keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.
“Nice one, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper’s gloves <PER>Harry</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No problem,” said <PER>Harry</PER> absentmindedly, as <PER>Harry</PER> searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Want one?” said <PER>Ron</PER> thickly, holding out a box of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Cauldrons.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s gone again!” “Can’t have done,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as his slid out of bed to get dressed.
<PER>Harry</PER> tapped the map with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, muttered, “Mischief managed,” though it hadn’t been, and got dressed, thinking hard.
The best way of finding out would be to tail he, but even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea: <PER>Harry</PER> had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework, and Apparition; <PER>Harry</PER> could not follow <PER>Malfoy</PER> around school all day without <PER>Harry</PER>'s absence being remarked upon.
“I thought you just said — ?” “Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed <PER>Ron</PER>, “but I don’t want to eat.” <PER>Harry</PER> scrutinized him suspiciously.
“You’ve just eaten half a box of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Cauldrons, haven’t you?” “It’s not that,” <PER>Ron</PER> sighed again.
“You you wouldn’t understand.” “Fair enough,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, albeit puzzled, as <PER>Harry</PER> turned to open the door.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> suddenly.
“What?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, I can’t stand it!” “You can’t stand what?” asked “<PER>Harry</PER>, now starting to feel definitely alarmed.
<PER>Harry</PER> gaped at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not expected this and was not sure <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to hear this.
“Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, walking up to <PER>Ron</PER> to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, “okay Say that again with a straight face.” “I love her,” repeated <PER>Ron</PER> breathlessly.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s fist was drawn right back; <PER>Ron</PER>’s's face was contorted with rage; <PER>Ron</PER>’s was about to strike again.
<PER>Harry</PER> reacted instinctively; <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Levicorpus\ <PER>Ron</PER> yelled as Levicorpus\ <PER>Ron</PER>'s heel was wrenched upward once more; Levicorpus\ <PER>Ron</PER> dangled helplessly, upside down, Levicorpus\ <PER>Ron</PER>'s robes hanging off Levicorpus\ <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What’s got into — ?” And then <PER>Harry</PER> saw the box lying open on <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed, and the truth hit <PER>Harry</PER> with the force of a stampeding troll.
“Where did you get those <PER>Cho</PER>colate Cauldrons?” “They were a birthday present!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free.
But on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, <PER>Ron</PER> had not been himself when himself had attacked, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought that himself would deserve another punching if himself permitted <PER>Ron</PER> to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.
“I’m going to let you down now, okay?” <PER>Harry</PER> sent <PER>Ron</PER> crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but <PER>Ron</PER> simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.” And without another word to her, <PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s way out of the portrait hole.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but <PER>Harry</PER> answered <PER>Harry</PER>'s office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed.
“Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, somewhat distracted by the fact that <PER>Ron</PER> was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, “well, I’ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right, <PER>Ron</PER> might’ve done something serious — ” Helpfully, <PER>Ron</PER> chose this moment to moan, “I can’t see her, <PER>Harry</PER> — is he hiding her?” “Was this potion within date?” asked Slughorn, now eyeing <PER>Ron</PER> with professional interest.
“They can strengthen, you know, the longer They’re kept.” “That would explain a lot,” panted <PER>Harry</PER>, now positively wrestling with <PER>Ron</PER> to keep him from knocking Slughorn over.
“Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph — ” “<PER>Ron</PER> — ” whispered <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ — and may you have many more — ” “<PER>Ron</PER>\” <PER>Ron</PER> had dropped his glass; his half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt over a low table and sprinted toward Slughorn ’s open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of <PER>Ron</PER>’s gargling breath filled the room.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> found it — the shriveled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from <PER>Harry</PER> in Potions.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurtled back to <PER>Ron</PER>’s side, wrenched open <PER>Harry</PER>'s jaw, and thrust the bezoar into his mouth.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were sitting around him; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> had spent all day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out.
“This isn’t how we imagined handing over our present,” said George grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on <PER>Ron</PER>’s bedside cabinet and sitting beside <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“How exactly did it happen, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> retold the story <PER>Harry</PER> had already recounted, it felt like a hundred times to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to <PER>McGonagall</PER>, to Madam Pomfrey, to <PER>Hermione</PER>, and to <PER>Ginny</PER>. "
and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they brought <PER>Ron</PER> up here.
Having hurtled, white-faced, up to <PER>Harry</PER> outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened, <PER>Hermione</PER> had taken almost no part in <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s obsessive discussion about how <PER>Ron</PER> had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightened-looking, until at last them had been allowed in to see him.
“Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once; <PER>Harry</PER> at once could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again.
“Slughorn poured it out — ” “Would he have been able to slip something into <PER>Ron</PER>’s glass without you seeing?” “Probably,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but why would Slughorn want to poison <PER>Ron</PER>?” “No idea,” said Fred, frowning.
“The poison could have been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself.” “Who’d want to kill Slughorn?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> reckons <PER>Voldemort</PER> wanted Slughorn on his side,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And maybe <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants <PER>Voldemort</PER> out of the way, maybe <PER>Voldemort</PER> thinks <PER>Voldemort</PER> could be valuable to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for Christmas,” <PER>Ginny</PER> reminded him.
“So the poisoner could just as easily have been after <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Then the poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had a bad head cold.
“I don’ believe this,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at <PER>Ron</PER>.
they both had done no more than satisfy they both that <PER>Ron</PER> would make a full recovery on they both's last visit to the ward; now Molly seized hold of <PER>Harry</PER> and hugged him very tightly.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s told us how you saved <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with the bezoar,” she sobbed.
“Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when <PER>Ron</PER> decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed; he and <PER>Hermione</PER> rose at once to leave and <PER>Hagrid</PER> decided to go with them, leaving <PER>Ron</PER> with his family.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s angry with <PER>Snape</PER>?” “I never said tha’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway.
“Look at the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I need ter — ” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, why is <PER>Dumbledore</PER> angry with <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked loudly.
“What’s <PER>Snape</PER> done?” “I dunno, <PER>Harry</PER>, I shouldn’ta heard it at all!
“Well — I jus’ heard <PER>Snape</PER> sayin’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> took too much fer granted an’ maybe <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — <PER>Snape</PER> — didn’ wan’ ter do it anymore — ” “Do what?” “I dunno, <PER>Harry</PER>, it sounded like <PER>Snape</PER> was feelin’ a bit overworked, tha’s all — anyway, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told him flat out him’d agreed ter do it an’ that was all there was to it.
“All the Heads o’ Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business — ” “Yeah, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s not having rows with the rest of them, is <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I know what yeh’re like abou’ <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, an’ I don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more inter this than there is.” “Look out,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tersely.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not need telling twice; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both hurried off; <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s and Filch’s raised voices echoed behind them as them ran.
It did not seem that people knew about <PER>Ron</PER> yet; <PER>Harry</PER> was very relieved: <PER>Harry</PER> had been interrogated enough that day.
<PER>Hermione</PER> bade <PER>Harry</PER> good night and set off for the girls’ dormitory.
So <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had argued with <PER>Snape</PER>.
In spite of all he had told <PER>Harry</PER>, in spite of <PER>Harry</PER>'s insistence that <PER>Harry</PER> trusted <PER>Snape</PER> completely, <PER>Harry</PER> had lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper with him.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not think that <PER>Snape</PER> had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
Was it because <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not want <PER>Harry</PER> to do anything foolish, to take matters into <PER>Harry</PER>'s own hands, that <PER>Harry</PER> had pretended there was nothing in <PER>Harry</PER>’s suspicions?
It might even be that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not want anything to distract <PER>Harry</PER> from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from Slughorn.
Perhaps <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not think it right to confide suspicions about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s staff to sixteen- year-olds.
“There you are, Potter!” <PER>Harry</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet in shock, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the ready.
“Look, why don’t you talk to <PER>Ron</PER> about all this?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what <PER>Ron</PER> had said about her new dress robes to whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Ron</PER> considered his relationship with Lavender to be “serious.” “Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and see him!” said Lavender fretfully.
“Is he?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, surprised, for he had found <PER>Ron</PER> perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>’s row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as possible.
“Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hurriedly, and <PER>Harry</PER> dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take <PER>Harry</PER> off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let <PER>Harry</PER> go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite <PER>Harry</PER>.
“So how’s McLaggen shaping up?” he asked <PER>Harry</PER> nervously, apparently forgetting that <PER>Harry</PER> had already asked the same question twice.
“I’ve told you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> patiently, “<PER>Harry</PER> could be world-class and I wouldn’t want to keep <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s already gone down to the pitch with <PER>Ginny</PER>.” “Oh,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking rather glum.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> stopped short at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, then gave a short, humorless laugh and continued walking.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> pushed past <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s friend followed at a trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.
This was infuriating; <PER>Harry</PER> was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was <PER>Malfoy</PER>, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: <PER>Harry</PER>’s best chance yet of discovering what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was up to.
The silent seconds trickled past, and <PER>Harry</PER> remained where <PER>Harry</PER> was, frozen, gazing at the place where <PER>Malfoy</PER> had vanished.
“Where have you been?” demanded <PER>Ginny</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted into the changing rooms.
“I met <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> told her quietly, as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarlet robes over his head.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam Hooch’s whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of <PER>Harry</PER>'s team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch.
Beside Luna, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was looking slightly uncomfortable, as though Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment. "
“McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you’re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!” bellowed <PER>Harry</PER>, wheeling around to face <PER>Harry</PER>'s Keeper.
A blinding, sickening pain a flash of light distant screams and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel And the next thing <PER>Harry</PER> knew, <PER>Harry</PER> was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head awkwardly.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s head felt strangely heavy; <PER>Harry</PER>’s raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, <PER>Harry</PER>'s recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> came in to visit while you were unconscious,” he said, after a long pause, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which <PER>Ginny</PER>, weeping over <PER>Harry</PER>'s lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Ron</PER> gave them his blessing.
“Yeah well, I saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn’t look like they wanted to be with him, and that’s the second time him’s made sure him isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; him skipped the last match too, remember?” <PER>Harry</PER> sighed.
“You couldn’t have missed a Quidditch match just to follow <PER>Malfoy</PER>, you’re the Captain!” “I want to know what he’s up to,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And don’t tell me it’s all in my head, not after what I overheard between he and <PER>Snape</PER> — ” “I never said it was all in your head,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at <PER>Harry</PER>, “but there’s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place!
If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour’s power, he would have been able to set a tail upon <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but unfortunately <PER>Harry</PER> did not have an office full of Aurors at <PER>Harry</PER>'s command.
It was easiest to feign sleep; <PER>Harry</PER> rolled over onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved shis wand.
This was, <PER>Harry</PER> reflected in the darkness, the third time that <PER>Harry</PER> had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury.
Last time <PER>Harry</PER> had fallen off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch, and the time before that, all the bones had been removed from <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm by the incurably inept Professor Lockhart.
That had been his most painful injury by far his remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the — <PER>Harry</PER> sat bolt upright, the — <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart pounding, the — <PER>Harry</PER>'s bandage turban askew.
“What’s going — ?” <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey’s office and muttered, “MuffliatoV’ so that Madam Pomfrey’s would not come running.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both leapt out of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both's beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both continued to try and kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squealing, “Stick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies — ” <PER>Harry</PER> aimed his wand at Peeves and said, “Langlockl” Peeves clutched at Langlockl's throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that Langlockl's tongue had just glued itself to the roof of Langlockl's mouth.
“Okay then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.
“Master called me?” croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he gave <PER>Harry</PER> a look that plainly wished <PER>Harry</PER> a painful death.
“I’ve got a job for you.” “Kreacher will do whatever Master wants,” said Kreacher, sinking so low that Master's lips almost touched Master's gnarled toes, “because Kreacher has no choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes “Dobby will do it, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” squeaked Dobby, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!
“Dobby would be honored to help <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” “Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Okay then I want you to tail <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.” Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face, <PER>Harry</PER> went on, “I want to know where <PER>Harry</PER>’s going, who <PER>Harry</PER>’s meeting, and what <PER>Harry</PER>’s doing.
“And if Dobby does it wrong, Dobby will throw Dobby off the topmost tower, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” “There won’t be any need for that,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily.
After a moment or two, and to <PER>Harry</PER>’s great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and said, with bitter resentment, “Master thinks of everything, and Kreacher must obey “Master even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy, oh yes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s the news that <PER>Ginny</PER> had argued with Dean.
The drowsing creature in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest suddenly raised The drowsing creature in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest head, sniffing the air hopefully.
“It’s all right!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> kindly, hurrying forward to help <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Here ” <PER>Hermione</PER> tapped the broken scales with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand and said, “Reparo.” The girl did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; <PER>Ron</PER> glanced back at The girl.
“What did <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean row about, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadn’t caught <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> could have been very badly hurt!” “Yeah, well, there was no need for <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean to split up over it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still trying to sound casual.
“Or are they still together?” “Yes, they are — but why are you so interested?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, giving <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> a sharp look.
“I just don’t want my Quidditch team messed up again!” he said hastily, but <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, “<PER>Harry</PER>!” giving “<PER>Harry</PER> an excuse to turn “<PER>Harry</PER>'s back on her.
I’ve been told to give you this.” It was a small roll of parchment, which <PER>Harry</PER> recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Tonight,” he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, once he had unrolled it.
“C’mon,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Hermione</PER>, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, “Why didn’t you tell me you were getting out today?
<PER>Hermione</PER> was acting as though <PER>Hermione</PER> was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> saw an inexplicable smirk cross <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
All that day <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room <PER>Hermione</PER> even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) <PER>Harry</PER>’s Herbology essay, something <PER>Hermione</PER> had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because <PER>Hermione</PER> had known that <PER>Harry</PER> would then let <PER>Ron</PER> copy his work.
“Thanks a lot, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o’clock.
“Enter,” called <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but as <PER>Harry</PER> put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside.
“Aha!” she cried, pointing dramatically at <PER>Harry</PER> as she blinked at <PER>Harry</PER> through shis magnifying spectacles.
“So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “My dear Sybill,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in a slightly exasperated voice, “there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but <PER>Harry</PER> does have an appointment, and I really don’t think there is any more to be said — ” “Very well,” said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice.
“Please close the door and sit down, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sounding rather tired.
<PER>Harry</PER> obeyed, noticing as <PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual seat in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory.
What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and <PER>Ron</PER> being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was up to, <PER>Harry</PER> had almost forgotten about the memory <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had asked <PER>Harry</PER> to extract from Professor Slughorn.
“I see,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> eventually, peering at <PER>Harry</PER> over the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s half-moon spectacles and giving <PER>Harry</PER> the usual sensation that <PER>Harry</PER> was being X-rayed.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s voice, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not even sound angry, but <PER>Harry</PER> would have preferred <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything.
“Sir,” Sir said, a little desperately, “it isn’t that I wasn’t bothered or anything, I’ve just had other — other things ” “Other things on your mind,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> finished the sentence for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I see.” Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence <PER>Harry</PER> had ever experienced with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt strangely diminished, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had shrunk a little since <PER>Harry</PER> had entered the room.
When <PER>Harry</PER> could stand it no longer <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I’m really sorry.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> killed <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s father and <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it.
“Now, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?” “Yes, sir.” “Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what <PER>Voldemort</PER> did until the age of seventeen?” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
“But now, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “now things become murkier and stranger.
“I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.” The idea that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> valued <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s opinion this highly made <PER>Harry</PER> feel even more deeply ashamed that <PER>Harry</PER> had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and <PER>Harry</PER> shifted guiltily in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it.
“Firstly, and very importantly, <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, I believe, more attached to this school than <PER>Voldemort</PER> has ever been to a person.
“And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tapped a bottle with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand, the cork flew out, and wand tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as wand did so, “After you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until <PER>Harry</PER>'s face touched them.
<PER>Harry</PER> could only assume that it was down in Hokey’s contract that she must lie through shis teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in <PER>Harry</PER>'s opinion.
The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man <PER>Harry</PER> had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw a red gleam in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dark eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah’s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s handsome features.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> reached out <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Voldemort</PER> was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.
“So there you are, Tom, dear, and I hope you enjoyed that!” She looked <PER>Voldemort</PER> full in the face and for the first time, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Shis foolish smile falter.
“Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, resuming <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s seat and indicating that <PER>Harry</PER> should do the same.
“It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused — ” “<PER>Voldemort</PER> modified shis memory, just like he did with Morfin!” “Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society <PER>Hermione</PER> had set up, S.P.E.W.
“I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, <PER>Harry</PER>, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that him saw the locket, at least, as rightfully him.” “The locket maybe,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but why take the cup as well?” “It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
And <PER>Harry</PER> dived after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office <PER>Harry</PER> had just left.
There was Fawkes slumbering happily on Fawkes's perch, and there behind the desk was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who looked very similar to the <PER>Dumbledore</PER> standing beside <PER>Harry</PER>, though both hands were whole and undamaged and <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was, perhaps, a little less lined.
The younger <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and The younger <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “Enter.” <PER>Harry</PER> let out a hastily stifled gasp.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> features were not those <PER>Harry</PER> had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet <PER>Voldemort</PER> was no longer handsome Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was wearing a long black cloak, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was as pale as the snow glistening on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders.
“Won’t you sit down?” “Thank you,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> took the seat to which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had gestured — the very seat, by the looks of it, that <PER>Harry</PER> had just vacated in the present.
“I have come a long way.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood and swept over to the cabinet where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> now kept the Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles.
Having handed <PER>Voldemort</PER> a goblet of wine and poured one for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned to the seat behind <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s desk.
“So, Tom to what do I owe the pleasure?<PER>Voldemort</PER> did not answer at once, but merely sipped <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wine.
Nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER> felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s refusal to use <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s chosen name was a refusal to allow <PER>Voldemort</PER> to dictate the terms of the meeting, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Voldemort</PER> took it as such.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for <PER>Voldemort</PER> to talk first.
“Certainly,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s eyes seemed to burn red.
“I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed — ” “Of some kinds of magic,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> corrected <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
“But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,” suggested <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“You are omniscient as ever, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lightly.
“Now, Tom ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> set down Tom ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s empty glass and drew Tom ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> up in Tom ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s seat, the tips of Tom ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fingers together in a very characteristic gesture.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s hand close over <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm again and moments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s hand was blackened and dead-looking once more.
“Why?” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, looking up into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s face.
“When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear to both of us.” <PER>Harry</PER> was still burning with curiosity and even though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had walked to the door and was holding it open for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not move at once.
“Don’t start, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“If it hadn’t been for the Prince, <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn’t be sitting here now.” “He would if you’d just listened to <PER>Snape</PER> in our first year,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> dismissively.
<PER>Harry</PER> ignored <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just found an incantation (“ Sectumsempral”) scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words “For Enemies,” and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but <PER>Harry</PER>, who would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the test whether ready or not.
Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, <PER>Ron</PER> was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for <PER>Snape</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already completed.
<PER>Harry</PER> fully expected to receive low marks on <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Harry</PER> had disagreed with <PER>Snape</PER> on the best way to tackle dementors, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not care: Slughorn’s memory was the most important thing to <PER>Harry</PER> now.
‘Tm telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help you with this, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, more loudly.
“It can’t be B — U — M — ” “No, it isn’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling <PER>Ron</PER>’s essay toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Don’t say I’ll have to write the whole thing out again!” “It’s okay, we can fix it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling the essay toward <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and taking out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand.
“I love you, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t let Lavender hear you saying that.” “I won’t,” said <PER>Ron</PER> into his hands.
“You and <PER>Cho</PER> just — ” “Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> “Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” said <PER>Ron</PER> gloomily, watching <PER>Hermione</PER> silently tapping each of <PER>Harry</PER>'s misspelled words with the end of <PER>Cho</PER>'s wand, so that they corrected they on the page.
“Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion?” <PER>Harry</PER>, who had found nothing useful in the Half- Blood Prince’s notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>'s essay.
The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and <PER>Ron</PER> scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using <PER>Hermione</PER>’s quill.
<PER>Hermione</PER> let out a little shriek; <PER>Ron</PER> spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Kreacher!” The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes.
“Dobby has been helping too, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!
“And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see <PER>Harry</PER> Potter so they can make their reports together!” “What is this?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances.
“What’s going on, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated before answering, because <PER>Harry</PER> had not told <PER>Hermione</PER> about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail <PER>Malfoy</PER>; house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her.
“Dobby has not slept for a week, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” said Dobby proudly, swaying where <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!
“Master <PER>Malfoy</PER> moves with a nobility that befits Master <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s pure blood,” croaked Kreacher at once.
“His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of — ” “<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> is a bad boy!” squeaked Dobby angrily.
“Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.” Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master <PER>Malfoy</PER> eats in the Great Hall, “Master <PER>Malfoy</PER> sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, “Master <PER>Malfoy</PER> attends “Master <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s classes in a variety of — ” “Dobby, you tell me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, cutting across Kreacher.
“Has he been going anywhere he shouldn’t have?” “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, “the <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but the <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy is still keen to avoid detection.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at him.
“If you need it to be Unplottable, it will be.” “Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s doing?” said <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> got into our headquarters there last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.” “But I don’t think you will, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> slowly.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t “<PER>Malfoy</PER>, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed.
“You’ve done brilliantly, Dobby.” “Kreacher’s done well too,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> kindly; but far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted Kreacher's huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, “The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear — ” “Get out of it,” <PER>Harry</PER> snapped at <PER>Harry</PER>, and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated.
“You’d better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.” “Thank you, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir!” squeaked Dobby happily, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter too vanished.
“How good’s this?” said <PER>Harry</PER> enthusiastically, turning to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the moment the room was elf-free again.
<PER>Hermione</PER> pulled it toward <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and began siphoning the ink off with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand.
“Hmmm the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> skeptically, rolling up <PER>Ron</PER>’s dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.
“Yes, we will,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, getting to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet and stretching.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how <PER>Malfoy</PER> was using the Room of Requirement and what <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, would see when <PER>Harry</PER> went in there the following day, for whatever <PER>Hermione</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that if <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been able to see the headquarters of the D.A., <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to see <PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s what could it be?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s mind worked feverishly and <PER>Harry</PER>'s dreams, when <PER>Harry</PER> finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who turned into Slughorn, who turned into <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning; <PER>Harry</PER> had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in <PER>Harry</PER>'s whispered plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Hermione</PER> might be a lot of help if <PER>Hermione</PER> wanted to.
“I haven’t forgotten about Slughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldn’t I find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s doing?” “I’ve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Yes!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, causing both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to gag on their breakfast.
<PER>Hermione</PER> set off immediately for Ancient Runes; <PER>Ron</PER> for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on <PER>Snape</PER>’s dementor essay; and <PER>Harry</PER> for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak once <PER>Harry</PER> had found an empty passage, but <PER>Harry</PER> need not have bothered.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached <PER>Harry</PER>'s destination <PER>Harry</PER> found it deserted.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure whether <PER>Harry</PER>'s chances of getting inside the room were better with <PER>Malfoy</PER> inside it or out, but at least <PER>Harry</PER>'s first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl.
I need you to become the place you become for <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> did not immediately open <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes when <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had finished <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s patrolling; <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was listening hard, as though <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> might hear the door pop into existence.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds outside.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> opened <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried every variation of “I need to see what <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> is doing inside you” that <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was forced to concede that <PER>Hermione</PER> might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Frustrated and annoyed, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak and stuffing Invisibility Cloak into <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s bag as he went.
“Late again, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, as <PER>Harry</PER> hurried into the candlelit classroom.
“Ten points from Gryffindor.” <PER>Harry</PER> scowled at <PER>Snape</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> flung himself into the seat beside <PER>Ron</PER>; half the class was still on its feet, taking out books and organizing their things; himself could not be much later than any of them.
“But sir, I heard people talking — ” “If you had actually read the article in question, Mister Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.” “I thought <PER>Snape</PER> and Mundungus were on the same side,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest “But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, Potter's black eyes fixed on <PER>Harry</PER> “Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.” The whole class looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, who hastily tried to recall what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn.
<PER>Harry</PER> took a deep breath and continued calmly, though <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides were boiling, “Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren’t they?
“I would expect nothing more sophisticated from you, <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.” “IVo!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, grabbing <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm as <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth furiously.
When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> (<PER>Hermione</PER> mysteriously melted out of sight as <PER>Hermione</PER> approached) and abused <PER>Snape</PER> hotly for <PER>Snape</PER>'s jibe about <PER>Ron</PER>’s Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER> shook her off by making a detour into the boys’ bathroom with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s right, though, isn’t he?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two.
“You’re right,” he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, “I’ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.” And so the following weekend, <PER>Ron</PER> joined <PER>Hermione</PER> and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; <PER>Harry</PER> missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time.
“You’d do better,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, when he confided this plan to <PER>Ron</PER> and her in the entrance hall, “to go straight to Slughorn’s office and try and get that memory from him.” “I’ve been trying!” said <PER>Harry</PER> crossly, which was perfectly true.
<PER>Harry</PER> had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> had not been able to catch <PER>Harry</PER>.
Twice, <PER>Harry</PER> had gone to <PER>Harry</PER>'s office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone.
“<PER>Harry</PER> doesn’t want to talk to me, <PER>Hermione</PER>!
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever <PER>Hermione</PER> said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement.
Once out of sight of the entrance hall, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Marauder’s Map and <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak from his bag.
Laughing, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance.
It gave <PER>Harry</PER> a most agreeable feeling of power as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to remember what form of words <PER>Harry</PER> had not yet tried.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt frustrated beyond belief; <PER>Malfoy</PER> might be just feet away from <PER>Harry</PER>, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing in there.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> might have broken <PER>Harry</PER>'s toe; as <PER>Harry</PER> clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
“You haven’t had any letters from anyone in the Order recently?” “No one from the Order writes to me anymore,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “not since Sirius — ” <PER>Harry</PER> saw that her eyes had filled with tears.
“Well I’ll see you around, <PER>Harry</PER> ” And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to stare after she.
After a minute or so, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed <PER>Harry</PER>'s efforts to get into the Room of Requirement, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was not in it.
Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would soon be back for lunch made his abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to <PER>Malfoy</PER> who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.
He found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.
“I did it — well, kind of!” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> enthusiastically when he caught sight of him.
“How’d you do, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer.
“Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should’ve heard Twycross going on about Twycross's — I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t pop the question soon — ” “And what about you?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
“She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she suddenly abandoning shis post to come and see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when he’s not even here?” “I had a thought,” said <PER>Harry</PER> tentatively.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt strange about voicing it; this was much more <PER>Hermione</PER>’s territory than <PER>Harry</PER>.
“For the last time, just forget about <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> firmly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet — Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them — for Them were taking Them's tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves.
<PER>Ron</PER> gave a start and tried to hide behind <PER>Hermione</PER> as a girl came around the corner.
Once the girl was out of earshot he said, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said we wouldn’t be having any more lessons until I got the memory!” “Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?” suggested <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> unrolled the parchment; but rather than finding <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run.
Dear <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, Aragog died last night <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, you met <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, and you know how special <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> was.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, I know you’d have liked <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> “Look at this,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, handing the note to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you can’t be thinking of going,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I s’pose <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’ll have to bury Aragog without us.” “Yes, he will,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking relieved.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, that’s it — get lucky!” “What d’you mean?” “Use your lucky potion!” “<PER>Ron</PER>, that’s — that’s it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding stunned.
“What on earth is more important than this memory, <PER>Harry</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of <PER>Harry</PER>'s imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved <PER>Ginny</PER> splitting up with Dean, and <PER>Ron</PER> somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of Dean's brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking .
“Oh, stop that,” <PER>Ron</PER> begged she, “I feel sick enough as it is — quick, hide me!” “It isn’t Lavender!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> impatiently, as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and <PER>Ron</PER> dived behind <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Cool,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, peering over <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder to check.
“Good luck.” “And you too!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a significant look, as <PER>Harry</PER> headed off to the dungeons.
There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: <PER>Harry</PER>, Ernie, and <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Undoubtedly, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, watching <PER>Harry</PER> over the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own book, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was begrudging the time <PER>Harry</PER> could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement.
Cheered by this thought, <PER>Harry</PER> skimmed through <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion-Making and found a heavily corrected Half-Blood Prince’s version of “An Elixir to Induce Euphoria,” which seemed not only to meet Slughorn ’s instructions, but which might (<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn into such a good mood that <PER>Harry</PER> would be prepared to hand over that memory if <PER>Harry</PER> could persuade <PER>Harry</PER> to taste some.
Ernie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine <PER>Harry</PER> for once, <PER>Harry</PER> had most rashly invented <PER>Harry</PER>'s own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely “passable.” The bell rang and both Ernie and <PER>Malfoy</PER> left at once.
“Sir,” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder; when <PER>Harry</PER> saw that the room was empty but for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried away as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
Disappointed, <PER>Harry</PER> emptied the cauldron, packed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> returned in the late afternoon.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” cried <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed through the portrait hole.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I passed!” “Well done!” <PER>Harry</PER>!” said.
“And <PER>Ron</PER>?” “He — He just failed,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ron</PER> came slouching into the room looking most morose.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER> — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded.
<PER>Harry</PER> took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle.
“Well, here goes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> raised the little bottle and took a carefully measured gulp.
Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> could have done anything, anything at all and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, smiling, brimming with confidence.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER> — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m going to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, I’ve got a good feeling about going to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.” “You’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, looking stunned.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak out of Invisibility Cloak's bag.
“I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?” “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, both looking positively alarmed now.
“You haven’t got another little bottle full of — I don’t know “Essence of Insanity?” suggested <PER>Ron</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> swung his cloak over his shoulders.
<PER>Harry</PER> laughed, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked even more alarmed.
“I know what I’m doing or at least” — he strolled confidently to the door — “Felix does.” he pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hurrying along behind him.
“What were you doing up there with her?” shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through <PER>Harry</PER> at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> emerging together from the boys’ dormitories.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them.
Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean came through it, and <PER>Harry</PER> was able to slip between <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not have to creep along, for <PER>Harry</PER> met nobody on <PER>Harry</PER>'s way, but this did not surprise <PER>Harry</PER> in the slightest: This evening, <PER>Harry</PER> was the luckiest person at Hogwarts.
Why <PER>Harry</PER> knew that going to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s was the right thing to do, <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea.
It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time: <PER>Harry</PER> could not see the final destination, <PER>Harry</PER> could not see where Slughorn came in, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was going the right way to get that memory.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the entrance hall <PER>Harry</PER> saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door.
It was when <PER>Harry</PER> reached the bottom step that it occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on <PER>Harry</PER>'s walk to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to <PER>Harry</PER> that this was a whim on which <PER>Harry</PER> should act, so <PER>Harry</PER> directed <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout.
“Good evening, Professor.” “Merlin’s beard, <PER>Harry</PER>, you made me jump,” said Slughorn, stopping dead in <PER>Harry</PER>'s tracks and looking wary.
“But I know that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts <PER>Hagrid</PER> to the hilt, so I’m sure he can’t be up to anything very dreadful.
“Well,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, with a most convincing hesitancy, “well, if you wanted to come, Professor, <PER>Hagrid</PER> would probably be really pleased.
“Yeh came,” croaked <PER>Hagrid</PER>, when Yeh opened the door and saw <PER>Harry</PER> emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yeah — <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> couldn’t, though,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of <PER>Hagrid</PER> he could easily reach.
“Are we going to bury him here, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, in your garden?” “Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> in a choked voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak, though <PER>Hagrid</PER>, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing.
“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,” said Slughorn, who like <PER>Harry</PER> could reach no higher than <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s elbow, but patted it all the same.
“Why don’t I say a few words?” He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as <PER>Harry</PER> stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, “Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t forget!
“I have had it all tested for poison,” he assured <PER>Harry</PER>, pouring most of the first bottle into one of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s bucket- sized mugs and handing it to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.” <PER>Harry</PER> saw, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind’s eye, the expression on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s face if <PER>Hermione</PER> ever heard about this abuse of house-elves, and decided never to mention it to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Well” — he raised his mug high — “to Aragog.” “Aragog,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> together.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, with the way ahead illuminated for <PER>Harry</PER> by Felix Felicis, knew that <PER>Harry</PER> must not drink, so <PER>Harry</PER> merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until well ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face darkened and <PER>Harry</PER> knew why: Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> had contrived to have <PER>Hagrid</PER> thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets.
“That’s never unicorn hair, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “Oh, yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> indifferently.
“It’s dead useful very strong, see.” Slughorn took another deep draught from Slughorn's mug, his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, for more treasures that <PER>Harry</PER> might be able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak- matured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smoking jackets.
<PER>Harry</PER> refilled <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s mug and <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, and questioned <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how <PER>Hagrid</PER> was able to look after them all.
The Felix Felicis gave <PER>Harry</PER> a little nudge at this point, and <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that <PER>Harry</PER> might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, <PER>Harry</PER> grinned to <PER>Harry</PER> as, unnoticed by either <PER>Hagrid</PER> or Slughorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.
After an hour or so, <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to elf-made wine, and to — “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, slopping some of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!”'s fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it.
“Me dad was no age ter go nor were yer mum an’ dad, <PER>Harry</PER>” Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s crinkled eyes again; <PER>Harry</PER> grasped <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and shook <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
“Can’t carry a tune to save my life.” “<PER>Hagrid</PER> wasn’t talking about your singing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s heavy snores.
“Yeah <PER>Voldemort</PER> murdered him and then stepped over him's body toward my mum,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Really, my dear boy, enough I’m an old man I don’t need to hear I don’t want to hear “I forgot,” lied <PER>Harry</PER>, Felix Felicis leading <PER>Harry</PER> on.
“You are the <PER>Cho</PER>sen One?” “Of course I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER> calmly.
“But then my dear boy you’re asking a great deal you’re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy — ” “You don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, of course I do, but — ” “You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?” Slughorn said nothing; Slughorn looked terrified.
Then, very slowly, Slughorn put <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s other hand inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak and took out a small, empty bottle.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as <PER>Harry</PER> crept back into the castle.
The front door had remained unlocked for <PER>Harry</PER>, but on the third floor <PER>Harry</PER> met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s shortcuts.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> returned to the school an hour ago.” Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward <PER>Harry</PER>, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff.
“him appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.” “Where is he?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart leaping.
“I believe, from what the Baron said, that the Baron had business to attend to before turning in — ” “Yeah, he has,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling <PER>Dumbledore</PER> he had secured the memory.
“Enter,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> knocked.
“Good gracious, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in surprise.
“And now,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, placing the stone basin upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> landed beside <PER>Harry</PER> just as <PER>Riddle</PER> asked, “Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?” “Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at <PER>Riddle</PER>, though winking at the same time.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Harry</PER> was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to <PER>Harry</PER> as their leader.
His voice was carefully controlled, but <PER>Harry</PER> could sense <PER>Harry</PER>'s excitement.
“Thank you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat too and waited for <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to speak.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard.
“You heard <PER>Voldemort</PER>: What <PER>Voldemort</PER> particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes.
“The diary, <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.” “I don’t understand, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But don’t you see, <PER>Harry</PER>, that if <PER>Harry</PER> intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, <PER>Harry</PER> was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of <PER>Harry</PER>'s soul concealed within it.
“Why couldn’t <PER>Harry</PER> make a Sorcerer’s Stone, or steal one, if <PER>Harry</PER> was so interested in immortality?” “Well, we know that <PER>Harry</PER> tried to do just that, five years ago,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I think you have earned that right.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart lift.
The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s decision; <PER>Harry</PER> saw a few of them shaking them's heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted.
“I can love!” It was only with difficulty that he stopped he adding, “Big deal!” “Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>, you can love,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what <PER>Harry</PER> had just refrained from saying.
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because <PER>Voldemort</PER> made it so.
Pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s black, withered hand, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “You are setting too much store by the prophecy!” “But,” spluttered <PER>Harry</PER>, “but you said the prophecy means — ” “If <PER>Voldemort</PER> had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled?
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> killed my mum and dad!” “You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> loudly.
“Yes.” But he understood at last what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been trying to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew — and so do I, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world.
Exhausted but delighted with <PER>Harry</PER>'s night’s work, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> everything that had happened during next morning’s Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them).
They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told They about <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s Horcruxes and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s promise to take <PER>Harry</PER> along, should he find another one.
“Wow,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> had finally finished telling them everything; <PER>Ron</PER> was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing.
Lavender Brown, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, glared at <PER>Hermione</PER> from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and <PER>Hermione</PER> immediately let go of <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm.
“We split up,” he told <PER>Harry</PER> out of the corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
“It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn’t have to finish it.” “Coward,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> looked amused.
“If <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean aren’t speaking ” “Oh — oh yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and <PER>Hermione</PER> was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s were still murky brown.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s vinegar turned to ice; <PER>Ron</PER>’s flask exploded.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed cheery too, though when asked what <PER>Hermione</PER> was grinning about <PER>Hermione</PER> simply said, “It’s a nice day.” Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s brain: She’s <PER>Ron</PER>’s sister.
He’s your best mate\ <PER>Harry</PER> barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until <PER>Hermione</PER> cried, “Katie!
“So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “to be in the ladies’ bathroom.” “Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “and have a go at the Room of Requirement again.” “That would be a complete waste of potion,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> flatly, putting down the copy of Spellman’s Syllabary <PER>Hermione</PER> had just taken out of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was about to put <PER>Harry</PER>'s book away again when <PER>Harry</PER> noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned “For Enemies,” that he had marked a few weeks previously.
he took the blow stoically enough when <PER>Harry</PER> told he, merely grunting and shrugging, but <PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct feeling as <PER>Harry</PER> walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
<PER>Ginny</PER> did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, <PER>Ginny</PER> was the life and soul of the team.
<PER>Ginny</PER> imitations of <PER>Ron</PER> anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of <PER>Harry</PER> bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused.
<PER>Harry</PER>, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at <PER>Ginny</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because <PER>Harry</PER> had not been keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes on the Snitch.
The battle still raged inside his head: <PER>Ginny</PER> or <PER>Ron</PER>?
Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender <PER>Ron</PER> might not mind too much if the post-Lavender <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Ginny</PER> out, but then the post-Lavender <PER>Ron</PER> remembered <PER>Ron</PER>’s expression when the post-Lavender <PER>Ron</PER> had seen <PER>Ginny</PER>'s kissing Dean, and was sure that <PER>Ron</PER> would consider it base treachery if <PER>Harry</PER> so much as held her hand.
Yet <PER>Harry</PER> could not help <PER>Harry</PER> talking to <PER>Ginny</PER>, laughing with <PER>Ginny</PER>, walking back from practice with <PER>Ginny</PER>; however much <PER>Harry</PER>'s conscience ached, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> wondering how best to get <PER>Ginny</PER>'s on <PER>Ginny</PER>'s own.
Once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> considered asking for <PER>Hermione</PER>’s help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when <PER>Hermione</PER> spotted he staring at <PER>Ginny</PER> or laughing at her jokes.
And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask <PER>Ginny</PER> out soon: he and <PER>Ron</PER> were at least agreed on the fact that <PER>Ginny</PER> was too popular for <PER>Ginny</PER>'s own good.
The balmy days slid gently through May, and <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to be there at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder every time <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause <PER>Ron</PER> to realize that nothing would make <PER>Harry</PER> happier than <PER>Harry</PER>'s best friend and <PER>Harry</PER>'s sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds.
There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; <PER>Ron</PER> wanted to talk tactics with <PER>Harry</PER> all the time and had little thought for anything else.
If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, would ever, ever let <PER>Harry</PER> forget that it had been <PER>Harry</PER> who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries.
Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind with success or failure in <PER>Harry</PER>'s plans for <PER>Ginny</PER>.
In the midst of all his preoccupations, <PER>Harry</PER> had not forgotten <PER>Harry</PER>'s other ambition: finding out what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was up to in the Room of Requirement.
He was still checking the Marauder’s Map, and as He was unable to locate <PER>Malfoy</PER> on it, deduced that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was still spending plenty of time within the room.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> was losing hope that <PER>Harry</PER> would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, <PER>Harry</PER> attempted it whenever <PER>Harry</PER> was in the vicinity, but no matter how <PER>Harry</PER> reworded <PER>Harry</PER>'s request, the wall remained firmly doorless.
A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> walking down to dinner alone from the common room, <PER>Ron</PER> having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and <PER>Hermione</PER> having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake <PER>Hermione</PER> thought <PER>Hermione</PER> might have made in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s last Arithmancy essay.
More out of habit than anything, <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder’s Map as <PER>Harry</PER> went.
For a moment he could not find <PER>Malfoy</PER> anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys’ bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle.
<PER>Harry</PER> only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when <PER>Harry</PER> walked right into a suit of armor.
The loud crash brought <PER>Harry</PER> out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, <PER>Harry</PER> dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below.
Outside the bathroom, <PER>Harry</PER> pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear against the door.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing with <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s back to the door, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hands clutching either side of the sink, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s white- blond head bowed.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw <PER>Harry</PER> staring at <PER>Harry</PER> over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> wheeled around, drawing <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand.
Instinctively, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hex missed <PER>Harry</PER> by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> sideways, thought Levicorpus\ and flicked <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> blocked the jinx and raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand for another — “No!
Slipping and staggering, <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and plunged toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood- soaked chest.
“No — I didn’t — ” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying; <PER>Harry</PER> fell to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees beside <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own blood.
<PER>Snape</PER> stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Go,” <PER>Snape</PER> said to Myrtle, and <PER>Snape</PER> swooped back into <PER>Snape</PER>'s toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Snape</PER> was going to do and <PER>Harry</PER> had never been able to prevent it.
The bathroom seemed to shimmer before <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes; <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to block out all thought, but try as <PER>Harry</PER> might, the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making swam hazily to the forefront of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> was staring at <PER>Snape</PER> again, in the midst of this wrecked, soaked bathroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared into <PER>Snape</PER>’s black eyes, hoping against hope that <PER>Snape</PER> had not seen what <PER>Snape</PER> feared, but — “Bring me your schoolbag,” said <PER>Snape</PER> softly, “and all of your schoolbooks.
Most people were walking the other way; Most people gaped at <PER>Harry</PER>, drenched in water and blood, but <PER>Harry</PER> answered none of the questions fired at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> ran past.
Would <PER>Snape</PER> tell Slughorn — <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach churned — how <PER>Harry</PER> had been achieving such good results in Potions all year?
Would <PER>Harry</PER> confiscate or destroy the book that had taught <PER>Harry</PER> so much the book that had become a kind of guide and friend?
<PER>Harry</PER> wrenched it open, flung <PER>Harry</PER> inside, and slammed it shut.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused for a moment, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter.
Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, <PER>Harry</PER> stood the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statue’s head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where <PER>Harry</PER> slammed the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and it turned at once back into stone.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming <PER>Ron</PER>’s copy of Advanced Potion- Making into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag as <PER>Harry</PER> did so.
A minute later, he was back in front of <PER>Snape</PER>, who held out his hand wordlessly for <PER>Harry</PER>’s schoolbag.
<PER>Harry</PER> handed it over, panting, a searing pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest, and waited.
One by one, <PER>Snape</PER> extracted <PER>Harry</PER>’s books and examined them.
“Then why,” asked <PER>Snape</PER>, “does it have the name ‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front cover?” <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart missed a beat.
“Poor Gryffindor fourth place this year, I fear ” And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than <PER>Ron</PER> had ever felt in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
“Leave it, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never made it to dinner; <PER>Harry</PER> had no appetite at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just finished telling <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need.
The news had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken The news upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story; <PER>Malfoy</PER> had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying <PER>Harry</PER> far and wide, and <PER>Snape</PER> had told the staff precisely what had happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who had told <PER>Harry</PER> he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly <PER>Snape</PER> ’s punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term.
“I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, evidently unable to stop <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was having a bad enough time without <PER>Hermione</PER> lecturing <PER>Harry</PER>; the looks on the Gryffindor team’s faces when He had told them He would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “how can you still stick up for that book when that spell — ” “Will you stop harping on about that book!” snapped <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Give it a rest, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was so amazed, so grateful, <PER>Harry</PER> looked up.
“By the sound of it, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad <PER>Harry</PER> had something good up <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleeve!” “Well, of course I’m glad <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t cursed!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, clearly stung.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked nervously at <PER>Harry</PER>, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind a book.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, little though <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening.
By Saturday morning, whatever himself might have told <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and the others.
“Ah, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> had knocked on <PER>Harry</PER>'s door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that <PER>Snape</PER>, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls.
It was, as <PER>Harry</PER> had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as <PER>Snape</PER> had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant <PER>Harry</PER> had just read <PER>Harry</PER>'s father or Sirius’s names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.
And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have just started <PER>Ginny</PER> playing Seeker against <PER>Cho</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall.
<PER>Snape</PER>, who had not spoken at all since setting <PER>Harry</PER> his task, finally looked up at ten past one.
<PER>Harry</PER> gaped as people began to scream at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>; several hands pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into the room.
“We won!” yelled <PER>Ron</PER>, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over the top of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in Dean Thomas's hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was beaming, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes sought <PER>Ron</PER>.
For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then <PER>Ron</PER> gave a tiny jerk of the head that <PER>Harry</PER> understood to mean, Well — if you must.
The fact that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter was going out with <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks.
After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making <PER>Harry</PER> happier than <PER>Harry</PER> could remember being for a very long time, rather than because <PER>Harry</PER> had been involved in horrific scenes of Dark Magic.
“You’d think people had better things to gossip about,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, as <PER>Ginny</PER> sat on the common room floor, leaning against <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs and reading the Daily Prophet “Three dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both roared with laughter.
“And what did you tell her <PER>Ron</PER>’s got?” “A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.” <PER>Ron</PER> scowled as <PER>Hermione</PER> rolled around laughing.
“Watch it,” he said, pointing warningly at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
But <PER>Ron</PER>’s tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s time together was becoming increasingly restricted.
<PER>Ginny</PER>’s O.W.L.s were approaching and <PER>Ginny</PER> was therefore forced to study for hours into the night.
On one such evening, when <PER>Ginny</PER> had retired to the library, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing <PER>Harry</PER>'s Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with <PER>Ginny</PER> at lunchtime, <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped into the seat between him and <PER>Ron</PER> with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.
“I want to talk to you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “What about?” said <PER>Harry</PER> suspiciously.
Only the previous day, <PER>Hermione</PER> had told him off for distracting <PER>Ginny</PER> when <PER>Hermione</PER> ought to be working hard for <PER>Hermione</PER>'s examinations.
“Will you please drop it?” He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve He's book, and He's performance in Potions was suffering accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of <PER>Ginny</PER>, had jocularly attributed this to <PER>Harry</PER> being lovesick).
But <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that <PER>Snape</PER> had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Prince’s book, and was determined to leave it where it was while <PER>Snape</PER> remained on the lookout.
“Prince, <PER>Hermione</PER>, PrinceV’ “Right!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, red patches blazing in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cheeks as <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And the first place I’ll look,” <PER>Hermione</PER> shot at him, as <PER>Hermione</PER> reached the portrait hole, “is records of old Potions awards!” <PER>Harry</PER> scowled after her for a moment, then continued <PER>Harry</PER>'s contemplation of the darkening sky.
“Thanks to <PER>Snape</PER> ” “You still got detention with <PER>Snape</PER> this Saturday?” <PER>Ron</PER> continued.
“And <PER>Harry</PER>’s hinting now that if I don’t get all the boxes done by the end of term, we’ll carry on next year.” he was finding these detentions particularly irksome because these detentions cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether <PER>Snape</PER> did not know this, for he was keeping <PER>Harry</PER> later and later every time, while making pointed asides about <PER>Harry</PER> having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.
<PER>Harry</PER> was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at <PER>Harry</PER>'s side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment.
“Thanks, Jimmy Hey, it’s from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning the parchment.
“You don’t reckon he hasn’t found ?” “Better go and see, hadn’t I?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, jumping to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
he hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at <PER>Harry</PER> in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged <PER>Harry</PER>’s defensive jinx.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped in <PER>Harry</PER>'s tracks, listening.
“How — dare — you — aaaaargh!” The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted toward The noise, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the ready, hurtled around another corner, and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, Professor Trelawney's head covered in one of Professor Trelawney's many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken.
“The Inner Eye,” said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, “was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily; <PER>Harry</PER> had heard about Professor Trelawney’s Inner Eye all too often before.
“I think you’d better tell Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m going to see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> right now,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You were never much of a Seer but you were a wonderful Object <PER>Harry</PER> did not reply; a wonderful Object <PER>Harry</PER> had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawney’s continual predictions of doom.
but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus <PER>Snape</PER>!” “What?” “Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with <PER>Snape</PER>, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I’m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips!
<PER>Harry</PER> was standing stock- still as waves of shock crashed over <PER>Harry</PER>, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from <PER>Harry</PER> for so long .
It was <PER>Snape</PER> who had carried the news of the prophecy to <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> and Peter Pettigrew together had sent <PER>Voldemort</PER> hunting after Lily and James and <PER>Snape</PER> and Peter Pettigrew Pettigrew together's son.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — I thought we were going to see the headmaster together?” “You stay here,” said <PER>Harry</PER> through numb lips.
“But dear I was going to tell <PER>Harry</PER> how I was assaulted in the Room of — ” “You stay here!” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated angrily.
She looked alarmed as <PER>Harry</PER> ran past She, around the corner into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not knock upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s door, <PER>Harry</PER> hammered; and the calm voice answered, “Enter” after <PER>Harry</PER> had already flung <PER>Harry</PER> into the room.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing at the window looking out at the grounds, a long, black traveling cloak in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s arms.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>, I promised that you could come with me.” For a moment or two, <PER>Harry</PER> did not understand; the conversation with Trelawney had driven everything else out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain seemed to be moving very slowly.
“Come with you ?” “Only if you wish it, of course.” “If I ” And then <PER>Harry</PER> remembered why <PER>Harry</PER> had been eager to come to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office in the first place.
“How is it protected?” “I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hesitated, then said, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.” “I’m coming,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, almost before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had finished speaking.
This seemed to show on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, for <PER>Dumbledore</PER> moved away from the window and looked more closely at <PER>Harry</PER>, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows.
“What has upset you?” “I’m not upset.” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you were never a good Occlumens — ” The word was the spark that ignited <PER>Harry</PER>’s fury.
“<PER>Snape</PER>!” <PER>Snape</PER> said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them.
“AND YOU LET HIM Breathing hard as though he was fighting, <PER>Harry</PER> turned away from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s knuckles in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused, biting <PER>Harry</PER>'s lip, and looked into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s lined face.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> made a terrible — ” “Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!” “Please let me finish.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> waited until <PER>Harry</PER> had nodded curtly, then went on.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> hated my dad like Professor <PER>Snape</PER> hated Sirius!
“And isn’t <PER>Voldemort</PER> convinced that Professor <PER>Snape</PER>’s on Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s side, even now?
“He’s up to something with <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> right now, right under your nose, and you still — ” “We have discussed this, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and now he sounded stern again.
“I have told you my views.” “You’re leaving the school tonight, and I’ll bet you haven’t even considered that <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> might decide to — ” “To what?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his eyebrows raised.
“What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?” “I they’re up to something!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands curled into fists as he said it.
“I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.” <PER>Harry</PER> bit back <PER>Harry</PER>'s retort, scared that <PER>Harry</PER> had gone too far, that <PER>Harry</PER> had ruined <PER>Harry</PER>'s chance of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> went on, “Do you wish to come with me tonight?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
“Very well, then: Listen.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drew <PER>Dumbledore</PER> up to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s full height.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were sitting together in the common room when He came back.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, are you okay?” <PER>Hermione</PER> added anxiously.
<PER>Harry</PER> dashed up the stairs and into <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory, where <PER>Harry</PER> flung open <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and pulled out the Marauder’s Map and a pair of balled-up socks.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat, looking stunned.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not pause either for <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s gasps of horror or for <PER>Ron</PER>’s hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for they later.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’t be here tonight, so <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s going to have another clear shot at whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s up to.
“You’ve got to watch <PER>Malfoy</PER> and you’ve got to watch <PER>Snape</PER> too.
“Take this as well — ” <PER>Harry</PER> thrust the socks into <PER>Ron</PER>’s hands.
“We don’t want it, you take it, who knows what you’re going to be facing?” “I’ll be fine, I’ll be with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned as <PER>Harry</PER> came skidding out onto the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
“I would like you to wear your cloak, please,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> waited until <PER>Harry</PER> had thrown it on before saying, “Very good.
“But what will people think when people see you leaving, Professor?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind on <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, “will we be Apparating?” “Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair as <PER>Harry</PER> looked out at moonlit sea and star-strewn sky.
<PER>Harry</PER> was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were standing, looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> might have been asking <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Lumos,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reached the boulder closest to the cliff face.
“You see?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly, holding <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand a little higher.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak, stuffed it into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket, and followed.
The water was icy; <PER>Harry</PER>’s waterlogged clothes billowed around <PER>Harry</PER>’s and weighed <PER>Harry</PER>’s down.
Taking deep breaths that filled <PER>Harry</PER>'s nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, <PER>Harry</PER> struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff.
<PER>Harry</PER> continued to swim in <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s wake, the tips of <PER>Harry</PER>'s benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Dumbledore</PER> rising out of the water ahead, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s silver hair and dark robes gleaming.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the spot <PER>Harry</PER> found steps that led into a large cave.
<PER>Harry</PER> clambered up them, water streaming from <PER>Harry</PER>'s soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing in the middle of the cave, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand held high as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not tell whether the shivers <PER>Harry</PER> was experiencing were due to <PER>Harry</PER>'s spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things <PER>Harry</PER> could not see.
Twice <PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as Twice <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could, occasionally pausing, running Twice <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally Twice <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stopped, Twice <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand pressed flat against the wall.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stepped back from the cave wall and pointed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand at the rock.
“You’ve d-done it!” said <PER>Harry</PER> through chattering teeth, but before the words had left <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m so sorry, I forgot,” <PER>Harry</PER> said; <PER>Harry</PER> now pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at <PER>Harry</PER> and at once, <PER>Harry</PER>’s clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.
“Thank you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> gratefully, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had already turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s attention back to the solid cave wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> stayed quite still; <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to break <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s concentration.
“Blood, if I am not much mistaken.” “Blood?” “I said it was crude,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> had fallen short of the standards <PER>Dumbledore</PER> expected.
“Professor!” protested <PER>Harry</PER>, hurrying forward as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s knife.
“You are very kind, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now passing the tip of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as <PER>Snape</PER> had healed <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wounds.
“After me, I think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked through the archway with <PER>Harry</PER> on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s heels, lighting <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own wand hastily as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> went.
“Certainly we could,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, stopping so suddenly that <PER>Harry</PER> almost walked into <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was still thundering as <PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Aha,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stopped again; this time, <PER>Harry</PER> really did walk into <PER>Harry</PER>; for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> toppled on the edge of the dark water, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s uninjured hand closed tightly around <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s upper arm, pulling <PER>Dumbledore</PER> back.
This time <PER>Harry</PER> was running <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, not over the rocky wall, but through the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip something invisible.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> moved closer to the water; <PER>Harry</PER> watched nervously as the tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim.
Keeping <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand clenched in midair, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> tapped the chain, which began to slide through <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water.
<PER>Harry</PER> gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I think <PER>Voldemort</PER> would have been prepared to risk what was, to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s lake.
They were crammed in together; <PER>Harry</PER> could not comfortably sit, but crouched, <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began to move at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw the reflected gold of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” “I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand!” “Yes, I am sure you did,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“So that thing that jumped out of the water — ?” But <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s answer before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, <PER>Harry</PER>'s open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair and <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes swirling around <PER>Harry</PER> like smoke.
“There are bodies in here!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
“Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> placidly, “but we do not need to worry about them at the moment.” “At the moment?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, tearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s gaze from the water to look at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not pretend now that <PER>Harry</PER> was not scared.
The great black lake, teeming with the dead It seemed hours and hours ago that <PER>Harry</PER> had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> Felix Felicis.
Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that <PER>Harry</PER> could not see at first, but when <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s illuminated wand <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake.
“Careful not to touch the water,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> again as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed out of the boat.
<PER>Harry</PER> squinted at it; at first, <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then <PER>Harry</PER> saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> approached the basin and <PER>Harry</PER> followed.
“Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pushed back the sleeve of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s robe over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s burned fingers toward the surface of the potion.
“Out of the way, please, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring soundlessly.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained silent while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> worked, but after a while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> withdrew <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt it was safe to talk again.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion.
“Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> would not want to kill the person who reached this island.” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe it.
“Sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice reasonable, “sir, this is <PER>Voldemort</PER> we’re — ” “I’m sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>; I should have said, <PER>Harry</PER> would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> corrected <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how them managed to penetrate so far through <PER>Harry</PER>'s defenses and, most importantly of all, why them were so intent upon emptying the basin.
Was this why <PER>Harry</PER> had been invited along — so that <PER>Harry</PER> could force-feed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> a potion that might cause him unendurable pain?
“You remember,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “the condition on which I brought you with me?” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin.
“But what if — ?” “You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?” “Yes, but — ” “I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but — ” “Well, then,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, “you have my orders.” “Why can’t I drink the potion instead?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> desperately.
“Once and for all, <PER>Harry</PER>, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?” “Couldn’t — ?” “Do I have it?” “But — ” “ Your word, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “I — all right, but — ” Before <PER>Harry</PER> could make any further protest, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lowered the crystal goblet into the potion.
For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> hoped that <PER>Harry</PER> would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lifted the glass to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mouth.
“Your good health, <PER>Harry</PER>.” And <PER>Harry</PER> drained the goblet.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched, terrified, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingertips were numb.
“How do you feel?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes closed.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Harry</PER> was in pain.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, his voice strained.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> face was twitching as though Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> panted and then spoke in a voice <PER>Harry</PER> did not recognize, for <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard <PER>Dumbledore</PER> frightened like this.
“I don’t want Don’t make me ” <PER>Harry</PER> stared into the whitened face <PER>Harry</PER> knew so well, at the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what to do. "
<PER>Harry</PER> tipped the contents of the goblet into <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s open mouth.
“Please make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and I’ll never, never again ” “This will make it stop, Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice cracking as <PER>Harry</PER> tipped the seventh glass of potion into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s mouth.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from <PER>Harry</PER>’s trembling hands as <PER>Harry</PER> moaned, “Don’t hurt them, don’t hurt them, please, please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead ” “Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, and once again <PER>Dumbledore</PER> obeyed <PER>Harry</PER>, opening <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth even as <PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot.
“Please, please, please, no not that, not that, I’ll do anything ” “Just drink, Professor, just drink ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drank like a child dying of thirst, but when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had finished, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> yelled again as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s insides were on fire.
“Just drink this It’ll be over all over!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face.
“No!” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung he down beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and heaved he over onto his back; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s glasses were askew, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s's mouth agape, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s's eyes closed.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “no, you’re not dead, you said it wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up — Rennervatel” he cried, his wand pointing at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened.
“Renneruate — sir — please — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyelids flickered; <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart leapt.
The goblet filled with clear water; <PER>Harry</PER> dropped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and brought the glass to his lips — but it was empty.
“But I had some — wait — AguamentiV’ said <PER>Harry</PER> again, pointing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the goblet.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> brain whirling in panic, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because <PER>Voldemort</PER> had planned it so <PER>Harry</PER> flung <PER>Harry</PER> over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish.
“Sir — here!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and lunging forward, <PER>Harry</PER> tipped the water clumsily over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s face.
It was the best <PER>Harry</PER> could do, for the icy feeling on <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water.
“Petrificus Totalusl” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed again, backing away as Petrificus Totalusl” <PER>Harry</PER> swiped Petrificus Totalusl” <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward Petrificus Totalusl” <PER>Harry</PER>.
Still slashing at the air with his wand, <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “ Sectumsempral SECTUMSEMPRAl” But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, their had no blood to spill: their walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as him backed away still farther, him felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless arms cold as death, and him's feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, and him knew there would be no release, that him would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s shattered soul.
They dropped <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms, but scrambled back up, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and staring around.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand was raised like a torch and from wand tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed the locket inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s robes.
Wordlessly, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gestured to <PER>Harry</PER> to come to <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> led <PER>Harry</PER> back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the water’s edge, where they slipped gratefully back into them's dark waters.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might not be able to climb into the boat; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> staggered a little as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> attempted it; all <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized him and helped him back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
“Sir,” panted <PER>Harry</PER>, “sir, I forgot — about fire — they were coming at me and I panicked — ” “Quite understandable,” murmured <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was alarmed to hear how faint <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice was.
They reached the bank with a little bump and <PER>Harry</PER> leapt out, then turned quickly to help <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Don’t worry, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, anxious about <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s extreme pallor and by <PER>Harry</PER>'s air of exhaustion.
They crossed the outer cave, and <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Dumbledore</PER> back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff.
“It’s going to be all right, sir,” <PER>Harry</PER> said over and over again, more worried by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s silence than <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s weakened voice.
“I am with you.” Once back under the starry sky, <PER>Harry</PER> heaved <PER>Dumbledore</PER> onto the top of the nearest boulder and then to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
Sodden and shivering, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s weight still upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> concentrated harder than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever done upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s destination: Hogsmeade.
Closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, gripping <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s arm as tightly as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stepped forward into that feeling of horrible compression.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew it had worked before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> opened <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes: The smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade.
For one horrible moment <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination showed <PER>Harry</PER> more Inferi creeping toward <PER>Harry</PER> around the sides of shops, but <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and saw that nothing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.
“We did it, Professor!” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered with difficulty; <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized that <PER>Harry</PER> had a searing stitch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Harry</PER>'s inexpert Apparition had thrown <PER>Dumbledore</PER> off balance; then <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp.
“Sir, are you all right?” “I’ve been better,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> weakly, though the corners of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mouth twitched.
“When did it appear?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand clenched painfully upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder as <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“Shall I run and fetch — ?” “No, <PER>Harry</PER> can do it.” <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at once.
As they sped toward the castle, <PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, ready to grab <PER>Harry</PER> should <PER>Harry</PER> fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> like a stimulant: <PER>Harry</PER> was bent low over <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes fixed upon the Mark, <PER>Harry</PER>'s long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air.
And <PER>Harry</PER> too looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside <PER>Harry</PER> like a venomous bubble, compressing <PER>Harry</PER>'s lungs, driving all other discomfort from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
Had <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s luck run out by now?
As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, <PER>Harry</PER> heard, over the whistling of the night air in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> muttering in some strange language again.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> understood why as <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle so they could enter at speed.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; <PER>Harry</PER> landed next to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seconds later and looked around.
“What does it mean?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, looking up at the green skull with its serpent’s tongue glinting evilly above them.
<PER>Harry</PER> backed away, drawing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand as <PER>Harry</PER> did so.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had wordlessly immobilized <PER>Harry</PER>, and the second <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had taken to perform the spell had cost <PER>Dumbledore</PER> the chance of defending <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> merely looked across at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s disarmer and said, “Good evening, <PER>Draco</PER>.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> stepped forward, glancing around quickly to check that <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were alone.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood imprisoned within <PER>Harry</PER>'s own invisible, paralyzed body, staring at the two of them, <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters’ distant fight, and in front of him, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> did nothing but stare at Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who, incredibly, smiled.
“<PER>Draco</PER>, <PER>Draco</PER>, you are not a killer.” “How do you know?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> at once.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> stiffened and glanced over <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s shoulder.
“I see,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> kindly, when <PER>Malfoy</PER> neither moved nor spoke.
“You are afraid to act until they join you.” “I’m not afraid!” snarled <PER>Malfoy</PER>, though he still made no move to hurt <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“He’s been offering me plenty of help — wanting all the glory for He — wanting a bit of the action — What are you doing?’ ‘Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything — ’ But I haven’t told him what I’ve been doing in the Room of Requirement, him’s going to wake up tomorrow and it’ll all be over and him won’t be <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s favorite anymore, him’ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!” “Very gratifying,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> mildly.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> looked nervously over <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s shoulder again, then back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who went on: “So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in Rosmerta's own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied?
“I had one and she had the other and I could send shis messages — ” “Isn’t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s Army used last year?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> voice was light and conversational, but <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> slip an inch lower down the wall as <PER>Harry</PER> said it.
“You care about me saying ‘Mudblood’ when I’m about to kill you?” “Yes, I do,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet slide a little on the floor as <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to remain upright.
There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> stood, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest.
“So let us discuss your options, <PER>Draco</PER>.” “My options!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw it drop by a fraction — But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs, and a second later <PER>Malfoy</PER> was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door onto the ramparts.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> cornered!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s sister and who was grinning eagerly.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wandless, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> alone!
<PER>Harry</PER> could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat, and, unmistakably, of blood coming from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And, yes, I am a little shocked that <PER>Draco</PER> here invited you, of all people, into the school where <PER>Draco</PER> here's friends live.
<PER>Draco</PER> here was not looking at Fenrir; <PER>Draco</PER> here did not seem to want to even glance at <PER>Draco</PER> here.
But <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hand was shaking so badly that <PER>Malfoy</PER> could barely aim.
“I’ll do it,” snarled Fenrir, moving toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hands outstretched, his teeth bared.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s spell — if him could only move, him could aim a curse from under the cloak — “<PER>Draco</PER>, do it or stand aside so one of us — ” screeched the woman, but at that precise moment, the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood <PER>Snape</PER>, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“We’ve got a problem, <PER>Snape</PER>,” said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “the boy doesn’t seem able — ” But somebody else had spoken <PER>Snape</PER>’s name, quite softly.
“Severus ” The sound frightened <PER>Harry</PER> beyond anything <PER>Harry</PER> had experienced all evening.
<PER>Snape</PER> said nothing, but walked forward and pushed <PER>Malfoy</PER> roughly out of the way.
<PER>Snape</PER> gazed for a moment at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of <PER>Snape</PER>'s face.
“Severus please ” <PER>Snape</PER> raised <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand and pointed it directly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Avada KedavraV’ A jet of green light shot from the end of <PER>Snape</PER>’s wand and hit <PER>Dumbledore</PER> squarely in the chest.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> seized <PER>Malfoy</PER> by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly.
As they vanished through the door, <PER>Harry</PER> realized <PER>Harry</PER> could move again.
“Petrificus Totalusl” The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but The Death Eater had barely hit the floor when <PER>Harry</PER> was clambering over <PER>Harry</PER> and running down the darkened staircase.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to get to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had to catch <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> landed, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand raised: The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but even as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> attempted to make out who was fighting whom, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> heard the hated voice shout, “It’s over, time to go\” and saw <PER>Snape</PER> disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> seemed to have forced he and <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s way through the fight unscathed.
He was on top of <PER>Harry</PER> before <PER>Harry</PER> could raise He's wand: <PER>Harry</PER> fell backward, with filthy matted hair in <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, the stench of sweat and blood filling <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat — “Petrificus Totalusl” <PER>Harry</PER> felt Fenrir collapse against <PER>Harry</PER>; with a stupendous effort <PER>Harry</PER> pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight.
<PER>Harry</PER> feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and <PER>Harry</PER> stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate.
<PER>Harry</PER> now saw red hair flying like flames in front of <PER>Harry</PER>: <PER>Ginny</PER> was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at <PER>Ginny</PER>'s while <PER>Ginny</PER> dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: “Crucio — Crucio — you can’t dance forever, pretty — ” “Impedimenta).” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>.
His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: His gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off His's feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down His's feet, and fell out of sight behind <PER>Ron</PER>, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater.
Beyond them, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window — “<PER>Harry</PER>, where did you come from?” <PER>Ginny</PER> cried, but there was no time to answer <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> must not escape, <PER>Snape</PER> must catch up with <PER>Snape</PER> — “Take that\” shouted Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, are you — ?” “M’all right,” muttered <PER>Neville</PER>, who was clutching his stomach, “<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Snape</PER> ’n’ <PER>Malfoy</PER> ran past ” “I know, I’m on it!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind <PER>Harry</PER>, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know.
<PER>Harry</PER> pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who must surely have reached the grounds by now.
“Out of the way!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, knocking two boys aside as <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase.
<PER>Harry</PER> flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: <PER>Harry</PER> could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate — by the looks of they, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> The cold night air ripped at <PER>Harry</PER>’s lungs as <PER>Harry</PER>’s tore after them; <PER>Harry</PER>’s saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted <PER>Harry</PER>’s's quarry.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse — Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and <PER>Harry</PER> understood: <PER>Hagrid</PER> had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, <PER>Harry</PER> sped up as an unbidden voice in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head said: not <PER>Hagrid</PER> not <PER>Hagrid</PER> too Something caught <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the small of the back and <PER>Harry</PER> fell forward, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: <PER>Harry</PER> knew, even as <PER>Harry</PER> rolled over, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind he.
And now he saw the vast outline of <PER>Hagrid</PER>, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s immense strength and the toughened skin <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s had inherited from <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's giantess mother seemed to be protecting him.
<PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, however, were still running; <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate — <PER>Harry</PER> tore past <PER>Hagrid</PER> and — <PER>Harry</PER>'s opponent, took aim at <PER>Snape</PER>’s back, and yelled, “Stupefy\” Stupefy\ missed; the jet of red light soared past <PER>Snape</PER>’s head; <PER>Snape</PER> shouted, “Run, <PER>Draco</PER>\” and turned.
Twenty yards apart, he and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each other before raising he and <PER>Harry</PER>'s wands simultaneously.
“Cruc — ” But <PER>Snape</PER> parried the curse, knocking <PER>Harry</PER> backward off <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet before <PER>Snape</PER> could complete it; <PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “Incendiol” <PER>Harry</PER> heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house was on fire.
“Cruc — ” yelled <PER>Harry</PER> for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but <PER>Snape</PER> blocked the spell again.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> sneering.
“You haven’t got the nerve or the ability — ” “Incarc — ” <PER>Harry</PER> roared, but <PER>Snape</PER> deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of <PER>Snape</PER>'s arm.
“It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up — ” “Impedi — ” But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> keeled over in the grass.
Someone was screaming, Someone would surely die of this agony, <PER>Snape</PER> was going to torture Someone to death or madness — “No!” roared <PER>Snape</PER>’s voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as <PER>Snape</PER>’s voice had started; <PER>Harry</PER> lay curled on the dark grass, clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and panting; somewhere overhead <PER>Snape</PER> was shouting, “Have you forgotten our orders?
<PER>Harry</PER> uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, <PER>Harry</PER> cared not whether <PER>Harry</PER> lived or died.
Pushing himself to himself's feet again, himself staggered blindly toward <PER>Snape</PER>, the man he now hated as much as himself hated <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself — “Sectum — !” <PER>Snape</PER> flicked <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but <PER>Harry</PER> was mere feet away now and <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Snape</PER>’s face clearly at last: <PER>Harry</PER> was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage.
Mustering all his powers of concentration, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, Levi — “No, Potter!” screamed <PER>Snape</PER>.
There was a loud BANG and <PER>Harry</PER> was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand flew out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
He could hear <PER>Hagrid</PER> yelling and Fang howling as <PER>Snape</PER> closed in and looked down on him where him lay, wandless and defenseless as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Kill me like you killed him, you coward — ” “DONT — ” screamed <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER>'s face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though <PER>Snape</PER> was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them — “CALL ME COWARD!” And he slashed at the air: <PER>Harry</PER> felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit <PER>Harry</PER> across the face and was slammed backward into the ground.
Spots of light burst in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from <PER>Harry</PER>'s body, then <PER>Harry</PER> heard a rush of wings above <PER>Harry</PER> and something enormous obscured the stars.
As <PER>Harry</PER> raised himself into a sitting position, himself's head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, himself saw <PER>Snape</PER> running as hard as himself could, the enormous beast flapping behind <PER>Snape</PER> and screeching as <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard <PER>Snape</PER> screech — <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to — <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, looking around groggily for <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as — <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, — <PER>Harry</PER> knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time — <PER>Harry</PER> had located — <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, — <PER>Harry</PER> turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, still dazed, looking around.
With a cry of thankfulness, <PER>Harry</PER> sank to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees; <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking in every limb, <PER>Harry</PER>'s body ached all over, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath came in painful stabs.
<PER>Harry</PER> could smell burnt wood and dog hair; <PER>Harry</PER> put out a hand and felt Fang’s reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you?” “ ’Course I am take more’n that ter finish me.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> put his hands under <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms and raised <PER>Harry</PER> up with such force that <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet momentarily left the ground before <PER>Hagrid</PER> set him upright again.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see blood trickling down <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.
“We should put out your house,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “the charm’s ‘Aguamenti’ ” “Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, “Aguamenti\” A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured “Aguamenti’ too: Together, he and <PER>Hagrid</PER> poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.
“Nothin’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’ be able to put righ’ ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a searing pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach at the sound of the name.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> ” “I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ’em cornin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, he killed ” “Killed?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> loudly, staring down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wha’, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s dead.
“<PER>Snape</PER> kill <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — don’ be stupid, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What musta happened was, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> musta told <PER>Snape</PER> ter go with them Death Eaters,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said confidently.
“What’re they all lookin’ at?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, as he and <PER>Harry</PER> approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as Fang could to their ankles.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in <PER>Harry</PER>'s face and <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s moan of pain and shock, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not stop; <PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly forward until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the place where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lay and crouched down beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had placed upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard <PER>Harry</PER> had ever, or would ever, meet.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s arms and legs, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might have been sleeping.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached out, straightened the half- moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with <PER>Harry</PER>'s own sleeve.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would <PER>Dumbledore</PER> speak to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, never again could <PER>Dumbledore</PER> help.
And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, as <PER>Harry</PER> picked it up, that there was something wrong.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned the locket over in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind <PER>Harry</PER>: To <PER>Voldemort</PER> I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy the real Horcrux as soon as I can.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had weakened <PER>Dumbledore</PER> by drinking that terrible potion for nothing.
<PER>Harry</PER> crumpled the parchment in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.
“C’mere, <PER>Harry</PER> ” “No.” “Yeh can’ stay here, <PER>Harry</PER> ” ”.
Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall.
Faces swam on the edges of <PER>Harry</PER>’s vision, people were peering at <PER>Harry</PER>, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase.
“It’s <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s orders,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Everyone’s up there, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and Lupin and everyone — ” Fear stirred in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest again: <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten the inert figures <PER>Harry</PER> had left behind.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, who else is dead?” “Don’t worry, none of us.” “But the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER> said the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER> stepped over a body — ” “the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER> stepped over Bill, but it’s all right, the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s alive.” There was something in her voice, however, that <PER>Harry</PER> knew boded ill. “Are you sure?” “Of course I’m sure the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s a — a bit of a mess, that’s all.
Pushing open the doors, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Neville</PER> lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ran to <PER>Harry</PER> and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill’s pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that <PER>Harry</PER> looked grotesque.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered how <PER>Snape</PER> had mended <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s Sectumsempra wounds so easily with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“No!” Lupin looked wildly from <PER>Ginny</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>, as though hoping the latter might contradict her, but when <PER>Harry</PER> did not, Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill’s bed, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands over <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never seen Lupin lose control before; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> was intruding upon something private, indecent.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned away and caught <PER>Ron</PER>’s eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what <PER>Ginny</PER> had said.
“How did it happen?” “<PER>Snape</PER> killed him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ — more Death Eaters arrived — and then <PER>Snape</PER> — and <PER>Snape</PER> did it.
And <PER>Harry</PER> felt, as <PER>Harry</PER> had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside <PER>Harry</PER>, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.
She stared at <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled She together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which She pushed under <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER>,” repeated <PER>McGonagall</PER> faintly, falling into the chair.
“We all wondered but <PER>Snape</PER> trusted always <PER>Snape</PER> I can’t believe it.
“We all always knew that.” “But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> swore <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was on our side!” whispered Tonks.
“I always thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> must know something about <PER>Snape</PER> that we didn’t.
“I mean with <PER>Snape</PER> ’s history of course people were bound to wonder but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told me explicitly that <PER>Snape</PER> ’s repentance was absolutely genuine.
“I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and they all turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> passed <PER>Voldemort</PER> the information that made <PER>Voldemort</PER> hunt down my mum and dad.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> believed <PER>Snape</PER> was sorry James was dead?
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked disoriented, twisting Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wet handkerchief in Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s hands.
“We all wanted more help, We all were glad to think <PER>Snape</PER> was on <PER>Snape</PER>'s way.
“So they got in through the Room of Requirement.” Almost against his will his glanced from <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>, both of whom looked devastated.
“I messed up, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> bleakly.
“We did like you told We: We checked the Marauder’s Map and we couldn’t see <PER>Malfoy</PER> on it, so We thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> went to keep watch on it but <PER>Malfoy</PER> got past We.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> came out of the room about an hour after We started keeping watch,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Gives light only to the holder, remember?” “Anyway,” <PER>Ginny</PER> went on, “he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black — ” “ — Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said <PER>Ron</PER> bitterly.
“But I don’t think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, because Gibbon came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.” “So if <PER>Ron</PER> was watching the Room of Requirement with <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, turning to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “were you — ?” “Outside <PER>Snape</PER>’s office, yes,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes sparkling with tears, “with Luna.
“I was so stupid, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a high- pitched whisper.
“We went into his office to see if We could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor and oh, it’s so obvious now, <PER>Snape</PER> must have Stupefied Flitwick, but We didn’t realize, <PER>Harry</PER>, We didn’t realize, We just let <PER>Snape</PER> go!” “It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, had you not obeyed <PER>Snape</PER> and got out of the way, <PER>Snape</PER> probably would have killed you and Luna.” “So then <PER>Snape</PER> came upstairs,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who was watching <PER>Snape</PER> running up the marble staircase in <PER>Snape</PER>'s mind’s eye, <PER>Snape</PER>'s black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling him's wand from under him's cloak as he ascended, “and he found the place where you were all fighting.
“We thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters — and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and We were fighting again — I thought I heard <PER>Snape</PER> shout something, but I don’t know what — ” “<PER>Snape</PER> shouted, ‘It’s over,’ ” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Minerva, is it true Is he really ?” As Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> nodded, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ginny</PER> move beside him and looked at her.
Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, <PER>Harry</PER> turned around: <PER>Ron</PER> looked as stunned as <PER>Harry</PER> felt and <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were exchanging startled looks.
The little of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was shaking with tears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand.
It was several minutes before <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that they were not heading for Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s office, but for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, and another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress.
In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when He and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on He and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s spindle-legged tables, Gryffindor’s sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk.
And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s half- moon spectacles perched upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.
After glancing once at this portrait, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the desk to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, herself's face taut and lined.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” she said, “I would like to know what you and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were doing this evening when you left the school.” “I can’t tell you that, Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had expected the question and had <PER>Harry</PER>'s answer ready.
It had been here, in this very room, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, it might be important,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“It is,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “very, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want me to tell anyone.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> glared at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Potter” — <PER>Harry</PER> registered the renewed use of — <PER>Harry</PER>'s surname — “in the light of Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat — “I don’t think so,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shrugging.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told me to stop following Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s orders if Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died.” “But — ” “There’s one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though.
“What are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, “I dunno, Professor that’s fer the Heads of House an’ the headmistress ter decide ” “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> always valued your views,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> kindly, “and so do I.” “Well, I’m stayin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard.
“Well ” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, losing a little of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s briskness as her voice shook.
“I — I know that it was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts — ” “Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely.
As <PER>Harry</PER> had hoped, <PER>Ron</PER> was waiting for <PER>Harry</PER>, still fully dressed, sitting on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.
“Someone had already taken it and left a fake in it place.” “Already taken — ?” Wordlessly, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the fake locket from <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket, opened it, and passed it to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“R.A.B.,” whispered <PER>Ron</PER>, “but who was that?” “Dunno,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, lying back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards.
: <PER>Harry</PER> doubted that <PER>Harry</PER> would ever feel curious again.
As <PER>Harry</PER> lay there, <PER>Harry</PER> became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent.
And Fawkes knew, without knowing how Fawkes knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left the school, had left the world had left <PER>Harry</PER>.
she had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, for wizards and witches were pouring into the village, preparing to pay wizards and witches's last respects to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s arms.
<PER>Harry</PER> was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that, sooner or later, <PER>Harry</PER> would be asked again to account for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s last excursion from Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were spending all of their time together.
The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; <PER>Harry</PER> could imagine how it would have been if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the year, <PER>Ginny</PER>’s examinations finished, the pressure of homework lifted and hour by hour, <PER>Harry</PER> put off saying the thing that <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> must say, doing what <PER>Harry</PER> knew was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo <PER>Harry</PER>'s best source of comfort.
<PER>Neville</PER> scars were as bad as ever — in truth, <PER>Neville</PER> now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs — but in personality His seemed just the same as ever.
so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said this.” “I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,” sighed <PER>Ginny</PER> later that evening, as she, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over the twilit grounds.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.” “Anyone else we know died?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.
“They’re still looking for <PER>Snape</PER> but no sign ” “Of course there isn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who became angry every time this subject cropped up.
“They won’t find <PER>Snape</PER> till They find <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and seeing as They’ve never managed to do that in all this time ” “I’m going to go to bed,” yawned <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“I haven’t been sleeping that well since well I could do with some sleep.” She kissed <PER>Harry</PER> (<PER>Ron</PER> looked away pointedly), waved at the other two, and departed for the girls’ dormitories.
The moment the door had closed behind her, <PER>Hermione</PER> leaned forward toward <PER>Harry</PER> with a most <PER>Hermione</PER>-ish look on her face.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not feel the way <PER>Harry</PER> had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; <PER>Harry</PER> simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before <PER>Harry</PER> could move a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>, the path that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had set out upon together, and which <PER>Harry</PER> now knew <PER>Harry</PER> would have to journey alone.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> kept reciting their names to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, as though by listing them <PER>Voldemort</PER> could bring them within reach: the locket the cup the snake something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s the locket the cup the snake something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s This mantra seemed to pulse through <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind as <PER>Harry</PER> fell asleep at night, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s dreams were thick with cups, lockets, and mysterious objects that <PER>Harry</PER> could not quite reach, though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> helpfully offered <PER>Harry</PER> a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment <PER>Harry</PER> began to climb.
<PER>Harry</PER> had shown <PER>Hermione</PER> the note inside the locket the morning after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s death, and although she had not immediately recognized the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.
“What about him?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> heavily, slumping back in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias <PER>Snape</PER>, and then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a “ — murderer,” spat <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He’d play up the pure- blood side so he could get in with <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and the rest of them.
he could not stop he dwelling upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s inexcusable trust in <PER>Snape</PER> but as <PER>Hermione</PER> had just inadvertently reminded him, he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had been taken in just the same.
“I don’t think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have liked it very much if <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d known.
“All that time he was showing me how <PER>Voldemort</PER> was evil even when <PER>Voldemort</PER> was at school, and I had proof <PER>Snape</PER> was too — ” “ ‘Evil’ is a strong word,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
Silence fell between them, each of them lost in them's own thoughts, but <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that they, like <PER>Harry</PER>, were thinking about the following morning, when <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body would be laid to rest.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s might see, about how <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s would feel.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s wondered whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s death would be more real to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> once it was over.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s chair was deserted too; <PER>Harry</PER> thought that perhaps <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s had not been able to face breakfast, but <PER>Snape</PER>’s place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour.
<PER>Harry</PER> avoided <PER>Harry</PER>'s yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; <PER>Harry</PER> had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not spared <PER>Malfoy</PER> much thought.
<PER>Harry</PER> animosity was all for <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had not forgotten the fear in <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice on that tower top, nor the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> had lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand before the other Death Eaters arrived.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not believe that <PER>Malfoy</PER> would have killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> despised <PER>Malfoy</PER> still for <PER>Harry</PER>'s infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with <PER>Harry</PER>'s dislike.
Where, <PER>Harry</PER> wondered, was <PER>Malfoy</PER> now, and what was <PER>Voldemort</PER> making <PER>Harry</PER> do under threat of killing <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had risen to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s feet, and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once.
They were heading, as <PER>Harry</PER> saw when <PER>Harry</PER> stepped out onto the stone steps from the front doors, toward the lake.
Most <PER>Harry</PER> did not recognize, but a few Most <PER>Harry</PER> did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands; Mister and Molly; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin.
Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs on her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in London; Arabella Figg, <PER>Harry</PER>’s Squib neighbor; the hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some people whom <PER>Harry</PER> merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake.
The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of The crowd, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Neville</PER> being helped into a seat by Luna.
had responded to <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s summons the night that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had died, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew why: They were the ones who had missed the D.A.
<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge walked past toward the front rows, <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge's expression miserable, twirling <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge's green bowler hat as usual; <PER>Harry</PER> next recognized <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, who, <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-taloned hand, and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-colored curls.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was dead.
But then <PER>Harry</PER> heard music, strange, otherworldly music, and <PER>Harry</PER> forgot <PER>Harry</PER>'s dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it.
“In there,” whispered <PER>Ginny</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
He was crying quite silently, He's face gleaming with tears, and in He's arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what <PER>Harry</PER> knew to be <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body.
A sharp pain rose in <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat at this sight: For a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day.
Tears were falling thick and fast into both <PER>Ginny</PER> ’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s laps.
Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalized looks from some, including, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER> but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would not have cared.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to make a friendly gesture to <PER>Hagrid</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> passed, but <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s eyes were so swollen it was a wonder <PER>Harry</PER> could see where <PER>Harry</PER> was going.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at the back row to which <PER>Hagrid</PER> was heading and realized what was guiding <PER>Harry</PER>, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost human.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> sat down next to his half-brother, and Grawp patted <PER>Hagrid</PER> hard on his great ugly boulderlike head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not hear what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying.
It had little to do with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> had known him.
him remembered <PER>Dumbledore</PER> crouching at the water’s edge two years ago, very close to where <PER>Harry</PER> now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had learned Mermish.
There was so much <PER>Harry</PER> had never asked <PER>Harry</PER>, so much <PER>Harry</PER> should have said.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> clutched the cold locket in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand so tightly that it hurt, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could not prevent hot tears spilling from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked away from <PER>Ginny</PER> and the others and stared out over the lake, toward the forest, as the little man in black droned on.
And <PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Harry</PER>'s first nightmarish trip into the forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and how he had faced <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and how he and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter.
And <PER>Harry</PER> saw very clearly as <PER>Harry</PER> sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about <PER>Harry</PER> had stood in front of <PER>Harry</PER> one by one, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother, <PER>Harry</PER>'s father, <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather, and finally <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, all determined to protect him; but now that was over.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited for somebody else to get to their feet; <PER>Harry</PER> expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.
White smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shapes: <PER>Harry</PER> thought, for one heart- stopping moment, that <PER>Harry</PER> saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished.
In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body and the table on which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had rested.
It was, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, the centaurs’ tribute: <PER>Harry</PER> saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>: <PER>Ron</PER>’s face was screwed up as though the sunlight were blinding him.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face was glazed with tears, but <PER>Ginny</PER> was no longer crying.
<PER>Hermione</PER> met <PER>Harry</PER>’s gaze with the same hard, blazing look that <PER>Harry</PER> had seen when <PER>Hermione</PER> had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in him's absence, and him knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when him told <PER>Hermione</PER>'s what him was going to do now, <PER>Hermione</PER> would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t do it,” but accept him's decision, because <PER>Hermione</PER> would not have expected anything less of him.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> uses people <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s enemies are close to.
<PER>Ron</PER>, he saw, was now holding <PER>Hermione</PER> and stroking her hair while her sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose.
With a miserable gesture, <PER>Harry</PER> got up, turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on <PER>Ginny</PER> and on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s tomb, and walked away around the lake.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Voldemort</PER> turned.
Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick, and stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s expression shrewd now.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> wants to kill me “<PER>Voldemort</PER>, and Aurors won’t stop <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“I see you are — ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s man through and through,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for <PER>Harry</PER>, casting nervous glances at the sobbing <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Grawp, who were still in their seats.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were hurrying toward <PER>Harry</PER>, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction.
“Wanted me to give him inside information on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and be the Ministry’s new poster boy.” <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then himself said loudly to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Look, let me go back and hit Percy!” “No,” she said firmly, grabbing his arm.
Even <PER>Hermione</PER> grinned a little, though Even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s smile faded as Even <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up at the castle.
<PER>Ron</PER> gaped at him, but <PER>Hermione</PER> said sadly, “I knew you were going to say that.
<PER>Harry</PER> had had the idea in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head ever since the night of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s death.
“Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven’t I?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of the lake.
“Well be there, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“And then well go with you wherever you’re going.” “No — ” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly; <PER>Harry</PER> had not counted on this, <PER>Harry</PER> had meant them to understand that <PER>Harry</PER> was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone.
“But mate, you’re going to have to come round my mum and dad’s house before we do anything else, even Godric’s Hollow.” “Why?” “Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.
