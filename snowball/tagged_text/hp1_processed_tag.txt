At half past eight, Vernon picked up Vernon's briefcase, pecked Petunia on the cheek, and tried to kiss <PER>Dudley</PER> good-bye but missed, because <PER>Dudley</PER> was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.
Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t seem to realize that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had just arrived in a street where everything from Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s name to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s boots was unwelcome.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> slipped the Put- Outer back inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat down on the wall next to the cat.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t look at it, but after a moment <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke to it.
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“As I say, even if <PER>Voldemort</PER> has gone — ” “My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call <PER>Voldemort</PER> by <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s name?
“It all gets so confusing if we keep saying <PER>Voldemort</PER>.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name.” “I know you haven’t,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave a great sniff as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> took a golden watch from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s pocket and examined it.
It must have made sense to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s late.
“And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?” “I’ve come to bring <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt and uncle.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s older.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s bringing him.” “You think it — wise — to trust <PER>Hagrid</PER> with something as important as this?” “I would trust <PER>Hagrid</PER> with my life,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sounding relieved.
sir bent sir's great, shaggy head over <PER>Harry</PER> and gave <PER>Harry</PER> what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.
“Shhh!” hissed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it.
“But I c-c- can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little <PER>Harry</PER> off ter live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, or we’ll be found,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> whispered, patting <PER>Hagrid</PER> gingerly on the arm as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> laid <PER>Harry</PER> gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s cloak, tucked a letter inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s blankets, and then came back to the other two.
For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s shoulders shook, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, nodding to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter rolled over inside <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's blankets without waking up.
Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but <PER>Dudley</PER> Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding <PER>Dudley</PER> Dursley's first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with <PER>Dudley</PER> Dursley's father, being hugged and kissed by <PER>Dudley</PER> Dursley's mother.
<PER>Harry</PER> rolled onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s back and tried to remember the dream <PER>Harry</PER> had been having.
<PER>Harry</PER> found a pair under <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on.
<PER>Harry</PER> was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of spiders, and that was where <PER>Harry</PER> slept.
When <PER>Harry</PER> was dressed <PER>Harry</PER> went down the hall into the kitchen.
Exactly why <PER>Dudley</PER> wanted a racing bike was a mystery to <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Dudley</PER> was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody.
<PER>Dudley</PER>’s favorite punching bag was <PER>Harry</PER>, but he couldn’t often catch <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t look it, but <PER>Harry</PER> was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but <PER>Harry</PER> had always been small and skinny for <PER>Harry</PER>'s age.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked even smaller and skinnier than <PER>Harry</PER> really was because all <PER>Harry</PER> had to wear were old clothes of <PER>Dudley</PER>’s, and <PER>Dudley</PER> was about four times bigger than <PER>Harry</PER> was.
<PER>Harry</PER> wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times <PER>Dudley</PER> had punched him on the nose.
The only thing <PER>Harry</PER> liked about <PER>Harry</PER>'s own appearance was a very thin scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
<PER>Harry</PER> must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in <PER>Harry</PER>'s class put together, but it made no difference, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair simply grew that way — all over the place.
<PER>Harry</PER> was frying eggs by the time <PER>Dudley</PER> arrived in the kitchen with <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother.
Aunt Petunia often said that <PER>Dudley</PER> looked like a baby angel — <PER>Harry</PER> often said that <PER>Dudley</PER> looked like a pig in a wig.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who could see a huge <PER>Dudley</PER> tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case <PER>Dudley</PER> turned the table over.
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while <PER>Harry</PER> and Uncle Vernon watched <PER>Dudley</PER> unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.
<PER>Dudley</PER>’s mouth fell open in horror, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart gave a leap.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> ought to feel sorry that Mistress Figg had broken Mistress Figg's leg, but it wasn’t easy when <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER> it would be a whole year before <PER>Harry</PER> had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mister Paws, and Tufty again.
“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.” The Dursleys often spoke about <PER>Harry</PER> like this, as though <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t there — or rather, as though <PER>Harry</PER> was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.
“You could just leave me here,” <PER>Harry</PER> put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what <PER>Harry</PER> wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on <PER>Dudley</PER>’s computer) .
“I suppose we could take <PER>Harry</PER> to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, "and leave <PER>Harry</PER> in the car.” “That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone.” <PER>Dudley</PER> began to cry loudly.
Half an hour later, <PER>Harry</PER>, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and <PER>Dudley</PER>, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.
“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to <PER>Harry</PER>’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.” I’m not going to do anything,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “honestly But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him.
Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s great relief, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t punished.
<PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to <PER>Harry</PER>’s surprise as anyone else’s, there <PER>Harry</PER> was sitting on the chimney.
The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from <PER>Harry</PER>’s headmistress telling them <PER>Harry</PER> had been climbing school buildings.
<PER>Harry</PER> supposed that the wind must have caught <PER>Harry</PER> in mid-jump.
Uncle Vernon liked to complain about things: people at work, <PER>Harry</PER>, the council, <PER>Harry</PER>, the bank, and <PER>Harry</PER> were just a few of Uncle Vernon's favorite subjects.
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon's seat and yelled at <PER>Harry</PER>, He's face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: <PER>Dudley</PER> and Piers sniggered.
The Dursleys bought <PER>Dudley</PER> and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked <PER>Harry</PER> what <PER>Harry</PER> wanted before they could hurry <PER>Harry</PER> away, they bought <PER>Harry</PER> a cheap lemon ice pop.
It wasn’t bad, either, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like <PER>Dudley</PER>, except that it wasn’t blond.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the best morning <PER>Harry</PER>’d had in a long time.
<PER>Harry</PER> was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that <PER>Dudley</PER> and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting <PER>Harry</PER>.
They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when <PER>Dudley</PER> had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought <PER>Harry</PER> another one and <PER>Harry</PER> was allowed to finish the first.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt, afterward, that <PER>Harry</PER> should have known it was all too good to last.
It gave <PER>Harry</PER> a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.” “I know,” <PER>Harry</PER> murmured through the glass, though <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure the snake could hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But the glass,” <PER>Harry</PER> kept saying, “where did the glass go?” " The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while <PER>Harry</PER> apologized over and over again.
As far as <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, <PER>Dudley</PER> was telling they how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.
But worst of all, for <PER>Harry</PER> at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “<PER>Harry</PER> was talking to it, weren’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dark cupboard much later, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> had a watch.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know what time it was and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.
After asking <PER>Harry</PER> furiously if <PER>Harry</PER> knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.
Everybody knew that <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang hated that odd <PER>Harry</PER> Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang.
<PER>Harry</PER> was glad school was over, but there was no escaping <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang, who visited the house every single day.
The rest of them were all quite happy to join in <PER>Dudley</PER>’s favorite sport: <PER>Harry</PER> Hunting.
This was why <PER>Harry</PER> spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where <PER>Harry</PER> could see a tiny ray of hope.
When September came <PER>Harry</PER> would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t be with <PER>Dudley</PER>.
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took <PER>Dudley</PER> to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> at Mistress Figg’s.
She let <PER>Harry</PER> watch television and gave <PER>Harry</PER> a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though She’d had it for several years.
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said Aunt Petunia couldn’t believe it was Aunt Petunia's Ickle <PER>Dudley</PER>kins, Ickle <PER>Dudley</PER>kins looked so handsome and grown-up.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t trust <PER>Harry</PER> to speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought two of <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.
<PER>Dudley</PER> and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from <PER>Harry</PER>’s new uniform.
“Make <PER>Harry</PER> get it.” “Get the mail, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Make <PER>Dudley</PER> get it.” “Poke him with your Smelting stick, <PER>Dudley</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked it up and stared at it, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart twanging like a giant elastic band.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back to the kitchen, still staring at <PER>Harry</PER>'s letter.
“Dad, <PER>Harry</PER>’s got something!” <PER>Harry</PER> was on the point of unfolding <PER>Harry</PER>'s letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand by Uncle Vernon.
“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and OUT!” took both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dudley</PER> by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dudley</PER> promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; <PER>Dudley</PER> won, so <PER>Harry</PER>, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where <PER>Dudley</PER> slept, and one where <PER>Dudley</PER> kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom.
It only took <PER>Harry</PER> one trip upstairs to move everything <PER>Harry</PER> owned from the cupboard to this room.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down on the bed and stared around <PER>Harry</PER>.
The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank <PER>Dudley</PER> had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was <PER>Dudley</PER>’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that <PER>Dudley</PER> had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because <PER>Dudley</PER> had sat on it.
<PER>Harry</PER> was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing <PER>Harry</PER>’d opened the letter in the hall.
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to <PER>Harry</PER>, made <PER>Dudley</PER> go and get it.
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle <PER>Dudley</PER> to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with <PER>Harry</PER>’s letter clutched in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“<PER>Dudley</PER> — go — just go.” <PER>Harry</PER> walked round and round <PER>Harry</PER>'s new room.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart hammered as <PER>Harry</PER> crept across the dark hall toward the front door — <PER>Harry</PER> leapt into the air; — <PER>Harry</PER>’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive\ Lights clicked on upstairs and to — <PER>Harry</PER>'s horror — <PER>Harry</PER> realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face.
Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t do exactly what <PER>Harry</PER>’d been trying to do.
Uncle Vernon shouted at <PER>Harry</PER> for about half an hour and then told <PER>Harry</PER> to go and make a cup of tea.
<PER>Harry</PER> shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time <PER>Harry</PER> got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap.
Twenty-four letters to <PER>Harry</PER> found Twenty-four letters to <PER>Harry</PER>'s way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that Twenty-four letters to <PER>Harry</PER>'s very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window.
“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” <PER>Dudley</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> in amazement.
When Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER> had run out with Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER>'s arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
<PER>Dudley</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.
<PER>Dudley</PER> snored but <PER>Harry</PER> stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.
If it was Monday — and you could usually count on <PER>Dudley</PER> to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was <PER>Harry</PER>’s eleventh birthday.
<PER>Harry</PER> privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer <PER>Harry</PER> up at all.
She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and <PER>Harry</PER> was left to find the softest bit of floor <PER>Harry</PER> could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
<PER>Harry</PER> shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach rumbling with hunger.
The lighted dial of <PER>Dudley</PER>’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on <PER>Dudley</PER>’s's fat wrist, told <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Dudley</PER>’s’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time.
<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Dudley</PER>’s’d lay and watched <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Dudley</PER>’s’d's birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
<PER>Harry</PER> hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although <PER>Harry</PER> might be warmer if it did.
Thirty seconds twenty ten nine — maybe he’d wake <PER>Dudley</PER> up, just to annoy he — three two one The whole shack shivered and <PER>Harry</PER> sat bolt upright, staring at the door.
“Anyway — <PER>Harry</PER>,” said the giant, turning — <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh.
<PER>Harry</PER> meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, and what <PER>Harry</PER> said instead was, “Who are you?” the giant chuckled.
It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the warmth wash over <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d sunk into a hot bath.
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> stared wildly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Yours sincerely, Minerva <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head like fireworks and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t decide which to ask first.
After a few minutes <PER>Harry</PER> stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
With his tongue between his teeth his scribbled a note that <PER>Harry</PER> could read upside down: Dear Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Given <PER>Harry</PER> his letter.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> <PER>Hagrid</PER> rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth was open and closed his mouth quickly.
As soon as <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Blown up?
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped; <PER>Harry</PER> had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.
Now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had been upset or angry chased by <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang, him had somehow found him out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, him’d managed to make it grow back and the very last time <PER>Dudley</PER> had hit him, hadn’t him got him's revenge, without even realizing him was doing it?
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, smiling, and saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was positively beaming at him.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> seized his umbrella and whirled his umbrella over his head, “NEVER — ” he thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at <PER>Dudley</PER> — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, <PER>Dudley</PER> was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> could tell it was daylight, <PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes shut tight.
And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart sinking.
But <PER>Harry</PER> still didn’t open <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
“All right,” <PER>Harry</PER> mumbled, “I’m getting up.” <PER>Harry</PER> sat up and <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s heavy coat fell off <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, so happy <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Don’t do that.” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to wave The owl out of the way, but The owl snapped the owl beak fiercely at <PER>Harry</PER> and carried on savaging the coat.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly.
“Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.” <PER>Harry</PER> counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg so <PER>Harry</PER> could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.
“Best be off, <PER>Harry</PER>, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” <PER>Harry</PER> was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just thought of something that made <PER>Harry</PER> feel as though the happy balloon inside <PER>Harry</PER> had got a puncture.
“Urn — <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “Mm?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was pulling on his huge boots.
“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, giving <PER>Harry</PER> another of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sideways looks.
“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They wanted <PER>Dumbledore</PER> fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge got the job.
Not only was <PER>Hagrid</PER> twice as tall as anyone else, <PER>Harry</PER> kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to <PER>Harry</PER> so <PER>Harry</PER> could buy their tickets.
“Still got yer letter, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> took the parchment envelope out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket.
“There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” <PER>Harry</PER> unfolded a second piece of paper <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: o!WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY First-year students will require: 1 .
Although <PER>Hagrid</PER> seemed to know where <PER>Harry</PER> was going, <PER>Harry</PER> was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all <PER>Harry</PER> had to do was keep close behind him.
If <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, <PER>Harry</PER> might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything <PER>Hagrid</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> so far was unbelievable, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help trusting <PER>Harry</PER>.
If <PER>Hagrid</PER> hadn’t pointed it out, <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have noticed it was there.
In fact, <PER>Harry</PER> had the most peculiar feeling that only he and <PER>Hagrid</PER> could see it.
Everyone seemed to know <PER>Hagrid</PER>; Everyone waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, clapping his great hand on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder and making <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees buckle.
“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter what an honor.” He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward <PER>Harry</PER> and seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, tears in <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.
“Doris Crockford, Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” “So proud, Potter, I’m just so proud.” “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” “Delighted, Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.” “I’ve seen you before!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in <PER>Harry</PER>'s excitement.
“Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER> will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>, grasping <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>, as though he’d rather not think about it.
But the others wouldn’t let Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER> keep <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> grinned at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Welcome,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “to Diagon Alley.” He grinned at <PER>Harry</PER>’s amazement.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked quickly over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “but we gotta get yer money first.” <PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had about eight more eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing them's shopping.
Several boys of about <PER>Harry</PER>’s age had Several boys of about <PER>Harry</PER>’s age's noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.
“Look,” <PER>Harry</PER> heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> made for the counter.
“We’ve come ter take some money outta Mister <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s safe.” “You have his key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
“That seems to be in order.” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> importantly, throwing out his chest.
Once <PER>Hagrid</PER> had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside Once <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s pockets, Once <PER>Hagrid</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but <PER>Harry</PER> kept them wide open.
Once, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
“I never know,” <PER>Harry</PER> called to <PER>Hagrid</PER> over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> pile some of it into a bag.
They went rattling over an underground ravine, and <PER>Harry</PER> leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> groaned and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> back by the scruff of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck.
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure, and <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was empty.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know where to run first now that <PER>Harry</PER> had a bag full of money.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that <PER>Harry</PER> was holding more money than <PER>Harry</PER>’d had in <PER>Harry</PER>'s whole life — more money than even <PER>Dudley</PER> had ever had.
Madam Malkin stood <PER>Harry</PER> on a stool next to <PER>Harry</PER>, slipped a long robe over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and began to pin it to the right length.
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” “Mmm,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> could say something a bit more interesting.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was standing there, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> and pointing at two large ice creams to show <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t come in.
“That’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.
<PER>Harry</PER> was rather quiet as <PER>Harry</PER> ate the ice cream <PER>Hagrid</PER> had bought <PER>Harry</PER> (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
<PER>Harry</PER> cheered up a bit when <PER>Harry</PER> found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.
When they had left the shop, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what’s Quidditch?” “Blimey, <PER>Harry</PER>, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!” “Don’t make me feel worse,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> almost had to drag <PER>Harry</PER> away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
“I was trying to find out how to curse <PER>Dudley</PER>.” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> wouldn’t let <PER>Harry</PER> buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.
While <PER>Hagrid</PER> asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
Outside the Apothecary, <PER>Hagrid</PER> checked <PER>Harry</PER>’s list again.
“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> go red.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stop stammering <PER>Harry</PER>'s thanks, sounding just like Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt strangely as though <PER>Harry</PER> had entered a very strict library; <PER>Harry</PER> swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> would blink.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> reflected in those misty eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed <PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s pink umbrella very tightly as <PER>Harry</PER> spoke.
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at people on the Underground, laden as people were with all people's funny- shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on <PER>Harry</PER>’s lap.
Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> only realized where they were when <PER>Hagrid</PER> tapped him on the shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure <PER>Harry</PER> could explain.
He’d just had the best birthday of <PER>Harry</PER>'s life — and yet — <PER>Harry</PER> chewed <PER>Harry</PER>'s hamburger, trying to find the words.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to watch <PER>Hagrid</PER> until <PER>Harry</PER> was out of sight; <PER>Harry</PER> rose in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat and pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose against the window, but <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and <PER>Hagrid</PER> had gone.
True, <PER>Dudley</PER> was now so scared of <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s cupboard, force <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> to do anything, or shout at <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> — in fact, they didn’t speak to <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> at all.
Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> in it were empty.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept to <PER>Harry</PER>'s room, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s new owl for company.
He pulled the ticket <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given the ticket <PER>Hagrid</PER> out of the ticket <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s pocket.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up and pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans because <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to walk into the station in <PER>Harry</PER>'s wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train.
Two hours later, <PER>Harry</PER>’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked <PER>Dudley</PER> into sitting next to <PER>Harry</PER>, and they had set off.
Uncle Vernon dumped <PER>Harry</PER>’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled <PER>Harry</PER>’s trunk into the station for Uncle Vernon.
a passing guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t even tell <PER>Harry</PER> what part of the country it was in, <PER>Harry</PER> started to get annoyed, as though <PER>Harry</PER> was being stupid on purpose.
According to the large clock over the arrivals board, <PER>Harry</PER> had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea how to do it; <PER>Harry</PER> was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> must have forgotten to tell <PER>Harry</PER> something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered if <PER>Harry</PER> should get out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten.
Heart hammering, <PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s cart after them.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched, careful not to blink in case <PER>Harry</PER> missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of <PER>Harry</PER> and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> was going to smash right into that barrier and then He’d be in trouble — leaning forward on <PER>Harry</PER>'s cart, <PER>Harry</PER> broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t be able to stop — the cart was out of control — <PER>Harry</PER> was a foot away — <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come <PER>Harry</PER> kept on running <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked behind <PER>Harry</PER> and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three- Quarters on it.
<PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.
<PER>Harry</PER> passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” “Oh, <PER>Neville</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> heard the old woman sigh.
<PER>Harry</PER> pressed on through the crowd until <PER>Harry</PER> found an empty compartment near the end of the train.
<PER>Harry</PER> put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk toward the train door.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice <PER>Harry</PER> dropped it painfully on <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pushing <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweaty hair out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
“I mean, yes, I am.” The two boys gawked at him, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> turning red.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down next to the window where, half hidden, <PER>Harry</PER> could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know what <PER>Harry</PER> was going to — but it had to be better than what <PER>Harry</PER> was leaving behind.
“Everywhere else is full.” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and the youngest redheaded boy sat down.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> still had a black mark on <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose.
“Are you really <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” <PER>Ron</PER> blurted out.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled back <PER>Harry</PER>'s bangs to show the lightning scar.
“So that’s where <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but I can’t remember it.” “Nothing?” said <PER>Ron</PER> eagerly.
“Are all your family wizards?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, who found <PER>Ron</PER> just as interesting as <PER>Ron</PER> found him.
After all, <PER>Harry</PER>’d never had any money in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life until a month ago, and <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> so, all about having to wear <PER>Dudley</PER>’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
and until <PER>Hagrid</PER> told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER> gasped.
“ You said <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name\” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding both shocked and impressed.
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back a smiling, dimpled woman's door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” <PER>Harry</PER>, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears went pink again and his muttered that his’d brought sandwiches.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that <PER>Harry</PER> had pockets rattling with gold and silver <PER>Harry</PER> was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as <PER>Harry</PER> could carry — but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars.
What the woman did have were Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared as <PER>Harry</PER> brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.
It was a nice feeling, sitting there with <PER>Ron</PER>, eating their way through all <PER>Harry</PER>’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
“What are these?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, holding up a pack of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frogs.
“So this is <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Weird).” <PER>Harry</PER> stared as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sidled back into the picture on <PER>Harry</PER>'s card and gave <PER>Harry</PER> a small smile.
<PER>Ron</PER> was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes off them.
Soon <PER>Harry</PER> had not only <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
“You want to be careful with those,” <PER>Ron</PER> warned <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>, and was relieved to see by <PER>Harry</PER>'s stunned face that <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
“I’m <PER>Ron</PER> Weasley,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to take <PER>Ron</PER>’s mind off Houses.
“So what do your oldest brothers do now that your oldest brothers’ve left, anyway?” <PER>Harry</PER> was wondering what a wizard did once <PER>Harry</PER>’d finished school.
his was just taking <PER>Harry</PER> through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t <PER>Neville</PER> the toadless boy, or <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger this time.
“And my names <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.” <PER>Ron</PER> gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked at him.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s pale cheeks.
“Unless you get out now,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, more bravely than <PER>Harry</PER> felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I think he’s been knocked out,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’ve met <PER>Malfoy</PER> before?” <PER>Harry</PER> explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s were a bit short for <PER>Ron</PER>’s, you could see <PER>Ron</PER>’s's sneakers underneath them.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were followed into their boat by <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“The firs’ years, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> nervously tried to flatten <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair.
Any second now, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> would come back and lead Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s doom.
“Now, form a line,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, <PER>Harry</PER> got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with <PER>Ron</PER> behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly looked down again as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, <PER>Harry</PER> thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, <PER>Harry</PER> stared at it, too.
“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Ron</PER>’s twin brothers catcalling.
Perhaps it was <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination, after all <PER>Harry</PER>’d heard about Slytherin, but <PER>Harry</PER> thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered being picked for teams during gym at <PER>Harry</PER>'s old school.
<PER>Harry</PER> had always been last to be chosen, not because <PER>Harry</PER> was no good, but because no one wanted <PER>Dudley</PER> to think they liked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Granger, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
When The hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” <PER>Neville</PER> ran off still wearing The hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give The hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: The hat had barely touched his head when The hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.
“Moon” , “Nott” , “Parkinson” , then a pair of twin girls, “Path” and “Path” , then “Perks, Sally- Anne” , and then, at last — “Potter, <PER>Harry</PER>!” As <PER>Harry</PER> stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.
“ Potter , did she say?” “ The <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” The last thing <PER>Harry</PER> saw before the hat dropped over <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
The ghost patted The ghost's arm, giving <PER>Harry</PER> the sudden, horrible feeling <PER>Harry</PER>’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
At the end nearest <PER>Harry</PER> sat <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized <PER>Harry</PER> at once from the card <PER>Harry</PER>’d gotten out of the <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog on the train.
<PER>Harry</PER> spotted Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than <PER>Ron</PER>, joined <PER>Harry</PER> at the Gryffindor table.
<PER>Harry</PER> crossed <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” <PER>Harry</PER> clapped loudly with the rest as <PER>Ron</PER> collapsed into the chair next to GRYFFINDOR!” <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well done, <PER>Ron</PER>, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across <PER>Harry</PER> as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> rolled up Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s empty gold plate.
<PER>Harry</PER> had only just realized how hungry <PER>Harry</PER> was.
Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was beaming at the students, Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> more than to see them all there.
“Is <PER>Harry</PER> — a bit mad?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked Percy uncertainly.
The Dursleys had never exactly starved <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER>’d never been allowed to eat as much as <PER>Harry</PER> liked.
<PER>Dudley</PER> had always taken anything that <PER>Harry</PER> really wanted, even if it made <PER>Harry</PER> sick.
<PER>Harry</PER> piled <PER>Harry</PER>'s plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching <PER>Harry</PER> cut up <PER>Harry</PER>'s steak.
He was right next to <PER>Malfoy</PER> who, <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell- 0, rice pudding As <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.
“What about you, <PER>Neville</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was talking to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>, in Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>'s absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
The hook-nosed teacher looked past <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s turban straight into <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“Ouch!” <PER>Harry</PER> clapped a hand to <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
Harder to shake off was the feeling <PER>Harry</PER> had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like <PER>Harry</PER> at all.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet again.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand a little flick, as if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> conducted only the Weasley twins's last few lines with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s legs were like lead again, but only because <PER>Harry</PER> was so tired and full of food.
“Great food, isn’t it?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> through the hangings.
Perhaps <PER>Harry</PER> had eaten a bit too much, because <PER>Harry</PER> had a very strange dream.
<PER>Harry</PER> was wearing Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s turban, which kept talking to <PER>Harry</PER>, telling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was <PER>Harry</PER>'s destiny.
<PER>Harry</PER> told the turban <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; <PER>Harry</PER> tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was <PER>Malfoy</PER>, laughing at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> struggled with it — then <PER>Malfoy</PER> turned into the hook-nosed teacher, <PER>Snape</PER>, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and <PER>Harry</PER> woke, sweating and shaking.
<PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and fell asleep again, and when <PER>Harry</PER> woke next day, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t remember the dream at all.
“There, look.” “Where?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “Wearing the glasses?” “Did you see his face?” “Did you see his scar?” Whispers followed <PER>Harry</PER> from the moment <PER>Harry</PER> left <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory the next day.
People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at <PER>Harry</PER>, or doubled back to pass <PER>Harry</PER> in the corridors again, staring.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished they wouldn’t, because <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to concentrate on finding <PER>Harry</PER>'s way to classes.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been quite right to think Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> wasn’t a teacher to cross.
By the end of the lesson, only <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave <PER>Hermione</PER> a rare smile.
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how <PER>Quirrell</PER> had fought off the zombie, <PER>Quirrell</PER> went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that <PER>Quirrell</PER> was protected wherever he went.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very relieved to find out that <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t miles behind everyone else.
Friday was an important day for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What have we got today?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> as he poured sugar on his porridge.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
<PER>Harry</PER> had gotten used to this by now, but it had given <PER>Harry</PER> a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until about a hundred owls saw about a hundred owls's owners, and dropping letters and packages onto about a hundred owls's laps.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>" <PER>Harry</PER> borrowed <PER>Ron</PER>’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that <PER>Harry</PER> had tea with <PER>Hagrid</PER> to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to <PER>Harry</PER> so far.
At the start-of-term banquet, <PER>Harry</PER> had gotten the idea that Professor <PER>Snape</PER> disliked <PER>Harry</PER>.
By the end of the first Potions lesson, <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER>’d been wrong.
<PER>Snape</PER> didn’t dislike <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — hated <PER>Harry</PER> —.
<PER>Snape</PER>, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at <PER>Harry</PER>’s name.
His eyes were black like <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s, but they had none of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s warmth.
he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER> had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger was on the edge of <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger's seat and looked desperate to start proving that <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger wasn’t a dunderhead.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked as stumped as he was; <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s hand had shot into the air.
“I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> had looked through <PER>Harry</PER>'s books at the Dursleys’, but did <PER>Snape</PER> expect <PER>Snape</PER> to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
<PER>Snape</PER> was still ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>’s quivering hand.
“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, <PER>Hermione</PER> stood up, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
“I think <PER>Hermione</PER> does, though, why don’t you try <PER>Hermione</PER>?” A few people laughed; <PER>Harry</PER> caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.
<PER>Snape</PER> swept around in <PER>Snape</PER>'s long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except <PER>Malfoy</PER>, whom He seemed to like.
“I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” <PER>Neville</PER> whimpered as boils started to pop up all over <PER>Neville</PER>'s nose.
Then him rounded on <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been working next to <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Don’t push it,” him muttered, “I’ve heard <PER>Snape</PER> can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind was racing and <PER>Harry</PER>'s spirits were low.
He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in He's very first week — why did <PER>Snape</PER> hate <PER>Snape</PER> so much?
“Cheer up,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “<PER>Snape</PER>’s always taking points off Fred and George.
Then <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.
“Make yerselves at home,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at <PER>Ron</PER> and started licking his ears.
“This is <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
“Another Weasley, eh?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, glancing at <PER>Ron</PER>’s freckles.
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes's teeth, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> pretended to be enjoying them as them told <PER>Hagrid</PER> all about them's first lessons.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were delighted to hear <PER>Hagrid</PER> call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mistress Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, like <PER>Ron</PER>, told <PER>Harry</PER> not to worry about it, that <PER>Snape</PER> liked hardly any of the students.
“Why should he?” Yet <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help thinking that <PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t quite meet <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes when <PER>Harry</PER> said that.
“How’s yer brother Charlie?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I liked him a lot — great with animals.” <PER>Harry</PER> wondered if <PER>Hagrid</PER> had changed the subject on purpose.
While <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hagrid</PER> all about Charlie’s work with dragons, <PER>Harry</PER> picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Ron</PER> telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but <PER>Ron</PER> hadn’t mentioned the date.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, <PER>Harry</PER> thought that none of the lessons <PER>Harry</PER>’d had so far had given <PER>Harry</PER> as much to think about as tea with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
And did <PER>Hagrid</PER> know something about <PER>Snape</PER> that he didn’t want to tell <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> had never believed <PER>Harry</PER> would meet a boy he hated more than <PER>Dudley</PER>, but that was before <PER>Harry</PER> met <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Anyway, I know <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> certainly did talk about flying a lot.
Even <PER>Ron</PER> would tell anyone who’d listen about the time Even <PER>Ron</PER>’d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom.
<PER>Harry</PER> had caught <PER>Ron</PER> prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.
<PER>Neville</PER> had never been on a broomstick in <PER>Neville</PER>'s life, because <PER>Neville</PER>'s grandmother had never let <PER>Neville</PER> near one.
Privately, <PER>Harry</PER> felt she’d had good reason, because <PER>Neville</PER> managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger was almost as nervous about flying as <PER>Neville</PER> was.
<PER>Neville</PER> was hanging on to shis every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him's broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t had a single letter since <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s note, something that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been quick to notice, of course.
A barn owl brought <PER>Neville</PER> a small package from <PER>Neville</PER>'s grandmother.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> jumped to their feet.
They were half hoping for a reason to fight <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
“What’s going on?” “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” Scowling, <PER>Malfoy</PER> quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.
At three-thirty that afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s broom jumped into <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand at once, but it was one of the few that did.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and <PER>Neville</PER>’s hadn’t moved at all.
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought <PER>Harry</PER>; there was a quaver in <PER>Neville</PER>’s voice that said only too clearly that <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet on the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were delighted when she told <PER>Malfoy</PER> he’d been doing it wrong for years.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw <PER>Harry</PER> gasp, slip sideways off the broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and <PER>Neville</PER> lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
“Give that here, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?” “Give it here!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> had leapt onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s broomstick and taken off.
Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak He called, “Come and get it, Potter!” <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
“Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” <PER>Harry</PER> ignored <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Give it here,” <PER>Harry</PER> called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!” “Oh, yeah?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and the broom shot toward <PER>Malfoy</PER> like a javelin.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> only just got out of the way in time; <PER>Harry</PER> made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> called.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward and pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom handle down — next second <PER>Harry</PER> was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — <PER>Harry</PER> stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand — a foot from the ground <PER>Harry</PER> caught it, just in time to pull <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom straight, and <PER>Harry</PER> toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> got to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s feet, trembling.
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t his fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Miss Patil — ” “But <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ” “That’s enough, Arthur.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was sweeping along without even looking at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had to jog to keep up.
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> didn’t say a word to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
He stomach twisted as He imagined it, watching <PER>Ron</PER> and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s bag.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> opened the door and poked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s head inside.
thought <PER>Harry</PER>, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Follow me, you two,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around <PER>Harry</PER> and staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Light — speedy — we’ll have to get <PER>Harry</PER> a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “I shall speak to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just finished telling <PER>Ron</PER> what had happened when <PER>Harry</PER>’d left the grounds with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about — ” “ — a century,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shoveling pie into <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
“Wood told me.” <PER>Ron</PER> was so amazed, so impressed, <PER>Harry</PER> just sat and gaped at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Catching the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, <PER>Harry</PER> added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ignored him and spoke to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and <PER>Malfoy</PER> were saying — ” “Bet you could,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered.
All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as <PER>Harry</PER> lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (<PER>Neville</PER> wasn’t back from the hospital wing).
<PER>Ron</PER> had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If him tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mistress Norris, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> was pushing <PER>Harry</PER>'s luck, breaking another school rule today.
On the other hand, <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat <PER>Malfoy</PER> face-to-face.
“Go back to bed!” “I almost told your brother,” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped, “Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
“Come on,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> followed <PER>Ron</PER> through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found <PER>Hermione</PER> facing an empty painting.
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, <PER>Neville</PER>, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said <PER>Neville</PER>, scrambling to <PER>Neville</PER>'s feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.” <PER>Ron</PER> looked at his watch and then glared furiously at <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>.
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies <PER>Quirrell</PER> told us about, and used it on you.” <PER>Hermione</PER> opened <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth, perhaps to tell <PER>Ron</PER> exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but <PER>Harry</PER> hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> took out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand in case <PER>Malfoy</PER> leapt in and started at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> had only just raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Horror-struck, <PER>Harry</PER> waved madly at the other three to follow <PER>Harry</PER> as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch’s voice.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s robes had barely whipped round the corner when <PER>Neville</PER>’s robes heard Filch enter the trophy room.
<PER>Neville</PER> suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run — <PER>Neville</PER> tripped, grabbed <PER>Ron</PER> around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.
“RUN!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, <PER>Harry</PER> in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
“I think we’ve lost him,” <PER>Harry</PER> panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
“I — told — you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “quickly as possible.” “<PER>Malfoy</PER> tricked you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I think well be okay — get off <PER>Neville</PER>!” For <PER>Neville</PER> had been tugging on the sleeve of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bathrobe for the last minute.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER>’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
<PER>Harry</PER> groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, <PER>Harry</PER>’d take Filch.
“If any dog needs exercise, that one does.” <PER>Hermione</PER> had got both <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bad temper back again.
“You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you?” But <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> something else to think about as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed back into bed.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> couldn’t believe his eyes when his saw that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one.
In the meantime, <PER>Harry</PER> filled <PER>Ron</PER> in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
Neither <PER>Neville</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now refusing to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, knocking <PER>Harry</PER>'s bacon to the floor.
Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> had difficulty hiding Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s glee as Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> handed the note to <PER>Ron</PER> to read.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> seized the package from <PER>Harry</PER> and felt the package.
“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to <PER>Harry</PER> with a mixture of jealousy and spite on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before <PER>Ron</PER> could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s elbow.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s obvious rage and confusion.
“Well, it’s true,” <PER>Harry</PER> chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen <PER>Neville</PER>’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “it’s doing us so much good.” <PER>Hermione</PER> marched away with her nose in the air.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a lot of trouble keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind on <PER>Harry</PER>'s lessons that day.
“Wow,” <PER>Ron</PER> sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedspread.
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, <PER>Harry</PER> mounted <PER>Harry</PER>'s broomstick and kicked off from the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.
“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, hoping <PER>Harry</PER> sounded offhand.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because <PER>Neville</PER> had been trying to catch <PER>Neville</PER>'s eye).
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, was to be working with <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
It was hard to tell whether <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> was angrier about this.
Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — <PER>Harry</PER> had to put it out with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hat.
“You’re saying it wrong,” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> snap.
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to <PER>Harry</PER> as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.” Someone knocked into <PER>Harry</PER> as they hurried past <PER>Harry</PER>.
On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that <PER>Hermione</PER> was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put <PER>Hermione</PER> out of their minds.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just helping <PER>Harry</PER> to a baked potato when Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER> came sprinting into the hall, Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>'s turban askew and terror on his face.
Everyone stared as <PER>Harry</PER> reached Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” <PER>Harry</PER> then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly grabbed <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm.
“I’ve just thought — <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “What about her?” “her doesn’t know about the troll.” <PER>Ron</PER> bit his lip.
“Percy!” hissed <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> behind a large stone griffin.
“He’s heading for the third floor,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, but <PER>Ron</PER> held up He's hand.
“Can you smell something?” <PER>Harry</PER> sniffed and a foul stench reached <PER>Harry</PER>'s nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger was about to faint.
“Confuse it!” <PER>Harry</PER> said desperately to <PER>Ron</PER>, and, seizing a tap, <PER>Harry</PER> threw it as hard as <PER>Harry</PER> could against the wall.
The troll didn’t even seem to notice a metal pipe, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward <PER>Ron</PER> instead, giving <PER>Harry</PER> time to run around it.
“Come on, run, run\” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled at <PER>Hermione</PER>, trying to pull <PER>Hermione</PER>'s toward the door, but <PER>Hermione</PER> couldn’t move, <PER>Hermione</PER> was still flat against the wall, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth open with terror.
<PER>Harry</PER> then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: <PER>Harry</PER> took a great running jump and managed to fasten <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms around the troll’s neck from behind.
The troll couldn’t feel <PER>Harry</PER> hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had still been in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand when he’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.
Howling with pain, even a troll twisted and flailed its club, with <PER>Harry</PER> clinging on for dear life; any second, even a troll was going to rip <PER>Harry</PER> off or catch <PER>Harry</PER> a terrible blow with the club.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had sunk to the floor in fright; <PER>Ron</PER> pulled out his own wand — not knowing what his was going to do his heard his cry the first spell that came into his head: “Wingardium Leviosal” The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto — owner’s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Ron</PER> was standing there with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand still raised, staring at what <PER>Harry</PER> had done.
A moment later, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had come bursting into the room, closely followed by <PER>Snape</PER>, with <PER>Quirrell</PER> bringing up the rear.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was looking at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was still standing with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand in the air.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Ron</PER> would put <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand down.
“Please, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> — they were looking for me.” “Miss Granger!” <PER>Hermione</PER> had managed to get to Granger!
“Well — in that case ” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, staring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” <PER>Hermione</PER> hung her head.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here <PER>Hermione</PER> was, pretending <PER>Hermione</PER> had, to get them out of trouble.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.” “Good of shis to get us out of trouble like that,” <PER>Ron</PER> admitted.
“Mind you, us did save she.” “she might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with she,” <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>.
On Saturday, <PER>Harry</PER> would be playing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.
Hardly anyone had seen <PER>Harry</PER> play because Wood had decided that, as anyone's secret weapon, <PER>Harry</PER> should be kept, well, secret.
But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know which was worse — people telling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’d be brilliant or people telling <PER>Harry</PER> they’d be running around underneath <PER>Harry</PER> holding a mattress.
It was really lucky that <PER>Harry</PER> now had <PER>Hermione</PER> as a friend.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all <PER>Harry</PER>'s homework without her, what with all the last- minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had saved her from the mountain troll, and <PER>Hermione</PER> was much nicer for it.
The day before <PER>Harry</PER>’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed at once that <PER>Snape</PER> was limping.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat together next to a window.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was checking <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s Charms homework for them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> would never let them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to read it through, them got the right answers anyway.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind off <PER>Harry</PER>'s nerves about tomorrow.
Getting up, he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> he was going to ask <PER>Snape</PER> if he could have it.
“Better you than me,” they said together, but <PER>Harry</PER> had an idea that <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.
<PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way down to the staffroom and knocked.
<PER>Snape</PER> was holding <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes above his knees.
“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to shut the door quietly, but — <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face was twisted with fury as <PER>Harry</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes quickly to hide <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg.
“I just wondered if I could have my book back.” <PER>Harry</PER> left, before <PER>Snape</PER> could take any more points from Gryffindor.
“Did you get it?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked as <PER>Harry</PER> joined them.
“What’s the matter?” In a low whisper, <PER>Harry</PER> told them what <PER>Harry</PER>’d seen.
“I know — <PER>Harry</PER>’s not very nice, but — <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t try and steal something <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was keeping safe.” “Honestly, <PER>Hermione</PER>, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER> was snoring loudly, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t sleep.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind — <PER>Harry</PER> needed to sleep, <PER>Harry</PER> had to, <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on <PER>Snape</PER>’s face when <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg wasn’t easy to forget.
“Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.” “Thanks, Seamus,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching Seamus pile ketchup on <PER>Harry</PER>'s sausages.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined <PER>Neville</PER>, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.
Meanwhile, in the locker room, <PER>Harry</PER> and the rest of the team were changing into <PER>Harry</PER> and the rest of the team's scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .
<PER>Harry</PER> thought Flint looked as if <PER>Harry</PER> had some troll blood in <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mount your brooms, please.” <PER>Harry</PER> clambered onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand.
“<PER>Harry</PER> hasn’t had much to do yet.” “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.” When Angelina had scored, <PER>Harry</PER> had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings.
“All right there, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> was faster than Higgs — <PER>Harry</PER> could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — <PER>Harry</PER> put on an extra spurt of speed — WHAM!
A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus Flint had blocked <PER>Harry</PER> on purpose, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s broom spun off course, <PER>Harry</PER> holding on for dear life.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — <PER>Harry</PER> had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom was completely out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s control.
No one seemed to have noticed that <PER>Harry</PER>’s broom was behaving strangely It was carrying <PER>Harry</PER> slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
“Dunno what <PER>Harry</PER> thinks <PER>Harry</PER>’s doing,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> mumbled.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s broom had given a wild jerk and <PER>Harry</PER> swung off it.
“Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” At these words, <PER>Hermione</PER> seized <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER> started looking frantically at the crowd.
“I knew it,” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, “<PER>Snape</PER> — look.” <PER>Ron</PER> grabbed the binoculars.
<PER>Snape</PER> had <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes fixed on <PER>Harry</PER> and was muttering nonstop under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath.
“What should we do?” “Leave it to me.” Before <PER>Ron</PER> could say another word, <PER>Hermione</PER> had disappeared.
<PER>Ron</PER> turned the binoculars back on <PER>Harry</PER>.
The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull <PER>Harry</PER> safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good — every time they got near <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> broom would jump higher still.
they dropped lower and circled beneath <PER>Harry</PER>, obviously hoping to catch <PER>Harry</PER> if <PER>Harry</PER> fell.
“Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered desperately.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had fought <PER>Hermione</PER>'s way across to the stand where <PER>Snape</PER> stood, and was now racing along the row behind <PER>Snape</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t even stop to say sorry as <PER>Hermione</PER> knocked Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER> headfirst into the row in front.
Up in the air, <PER>Harry</PER> was suddenly able to clamber back on to <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, you can look!” <PER>Ron</PER> said.
<PER>Neville</PER> had been sobbing into <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s jacket for the last five minutes.
<PER>Harry</PER> was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw <PER>Harry</PER> clap <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth as though <PER>Harry</PER> was about to be sick — <PER>Harry</PER> hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into — <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> was being made a cup of strong tea back in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“It was <PER>Snape</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> was explaining, “<PER>Hermione</PER> and I saw him.
“Why would <PER>Snape</PER> do somethin’ like that?” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.
“ Fluffy ?” “Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to guard the — ” “Yes?” said <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
“That’s top secret, that is.” “But <PER>Snape</PER>’s trying to steal it.” “Rubbish,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> again.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did he just try and kill <PER>Harry</PER>?” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I don’ know why <PER>Harry</PER>’s broom acted like that, but <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn’ try an’ kill a student!
The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that the Weasley twins followed <PER>Quirrell</PER> around, bouncing off the back of <PER>Quirrell</PER>'s turban.
“I do feel so sorry,” said <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, one Potions class, “for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home.” He was looking over at <PER>Harry</PER> as He spoke.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored <PER>Harry</PER>, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish.
Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to stay on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bucking broomstick.
So <PER>Malfoy</PER>, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting <PER>Harry</PER> about having no proper family.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and <PER>Harry</PER> had signed up at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel sorry for <PER>Harry</PER> at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d ever had.
“Hi, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, want any help?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked, sticking his head through the branches.
“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, <PER>Ron</PER>.” “Would you mind moving out of the way?” came <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s cold drawl from behind them.
<PER>Ron</PER> let go of the front of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s robes.
“He was provoked, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, sticking He's huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> was insultin’ “<PER>Malfoy</PER>'s family.” “Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER> silkily.
“I’ll get him,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinding him's teeth at <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get him — ” “I hate them both,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “<PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.” So the three of them followed <PER>Hagrid</PER> and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.
“And that reminds me — <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and they left <PER>Hagrid</PER> looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
they had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since <PER>Hagrid</PER> had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to steal?
<PER>Hermione</PER> took out a list of subjects and titles <PER>Hermione</PER> had decided to search while <PER>Ron</PER> strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random.
Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER>’d never get one.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already agreed He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’d better not ask Madam Pince where He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> could find Flamel.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t very hopeful.
Five minutes later, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined him, shaking their heads.
Once the holidays had started, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.
<PER>Ron</PER> also started teaching <PER>Harry</PER> wizard chess.
<PER>Harry</PER> played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent <PER>Harry</PER>, and they didn’t trust <PER>Harry</PER> at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at <PER>Harry</PER>, which was confusing.
“Merry Christmas,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sleepily as <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.
It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across It was To <PER>Harry</PER>, from <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?” “I think I know who that one’s from,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
“Every year My mom makes us a sweater,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, unwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.” “That’s really nice of My mom,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.
<PER>Harry</PER> next present also contained candy — a large box of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frogs from <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m sure it is — try it on.” <PER>Harry</PER> threw the cloak around <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders and <PER>Ron</PER> gave a yell.
“Merry Christmas!” “Hey, look — <PER>Harry</PER>’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. “<PER>Harry</PER>’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up <PER>Harry</PER>’s sweater.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never in all <PER>Harry</PER>'s life had such a Christmas dinner.
Up at the High Table, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had swapped <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read Professor Flitwick.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Hagrid</PER> getting redder and redder in the face as <PER>Harry</PER> called for more wine, finally kissing Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> on the cheek, who, to <PER>Harry</PER>’s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
When <PER>Harry</PER> finally left the table, <PER>Harry</PER> was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- Your-Own-Warts kit, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s own new wizard chess set.
Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where <PER>Harry</PER> broke in <PER>Harry</PER>'s new chess set by losing spectacularly to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> suspected <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help Percy so much.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned over the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own bed and pulled the cloak out from under the cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> father’s this had been <PER>Harry</PER>'s father’s.
Excitement flooded through <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> stood there in the dark and silence.
Should <PER>Harry</PER> wake <PER>Harry</PER>?
Something held <PER>Harry</PER> back — his father’s cloak — <PER>Harry</PER> felt that this time — the first time — <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to use it alone.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart racing, and thought.
<PER>Harry</PER> lit a lamp to see <PER>Harry</PER>'s way along the rows of books.
a lamp looked as if The lamp was floating along in midair, and even though <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm supporting it, the sight gave <PER>Harry</PER> the creeps.
Maybe <PER>Harry</PER> was imagining it, maybe not, but <PER>Harry</PER> thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be.
<PER>Harry</PER> stumbled backward and knocked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s lamp, which went out at once.
Panicking, <PER>Harry</PER> heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, <PER>Harry</PER> ran for it.
<PER>Harry</PER> passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and <PER>Harry</PER> slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears.
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt the blood drain out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at <PER>Harry</PER> but see no reflection again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to clap <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from screaming.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed — for <PER>Harry</PER> had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder — but still, no one was there.
<PER>Harry</PER> was so close to the mirror now that <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose was nearly touching that of <PER>Harry</PER>'s reflection.
And slowly, <PER>Harry</PER> looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like <PER>Harry</PER>, other noses like <PER>Harry</PER>, even a little old man who looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>’s knobbly knees — <PER>Harry</PER> was looking at — <PER>Harry</PER>'s family, for the first time in — <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
The Potters smiled and waved at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> stared hungrily back at them, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands pressed flat against the glass as though <PER>Harry</PER> was hoping to fall right through it and reach them.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a powerful kind of ache inside <PER>Harry</PER>, half joy, half terrible sadness.
How long <PER>Harry</PER> stood there, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know.
The reflections did not fade and <PER>Harry</PER> looked and looked until a distant noise brought <PER>Harry</PER> back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s senses.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stay here, <PER>Harry</PER> had to find <PER>Harry</PER>'s way back to bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> tore <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes away from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.
“You look odd.” What <PER>Harry</PER> feared most was that <PER>Harry</PER> might not be able to find the mirror room again.
Just as <PER>Ron</PER> started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted the suit of armor.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped the cloak from around <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders and ran to the mirror.
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” <PER>Ron</PER> tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> stood quite still, both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats?
“Want to play chess, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“No.” “Why don’t we go down and visit <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “No you go ” “I know what you’re thinking about, <PER>Harry</PER>, that mirror.
There was nothing to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from staying here all night with <PER>Harry</PER>'s family.
Except — “So — back again, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides had turned to ice.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> must have walked straight past <PER>Harry</PER>, so desperate to get to the mirror <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t noticed <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was relieved to see that <PER>Harry</PER> was smiling.
“So,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with <PER>Harry</PER>, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “It — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend <PER>Ron</PER> himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gently.
“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had convinced <PER>Harry</PER> not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> could forget what <PER>Harry</PER>’d seen in the mirror as easily, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t.
Over and over again <PER>Harry</PER> dreamed about <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
“You see, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> told him about these dreams.
Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that he had had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though <PER>Harry</PER> was still sure <PER>Harry</PER>’d read the name somewhere.
Quite apart from wanting to win, <PER>Harry</PER> found that <PER>Harry</PER> had fewer nightmares when <PER>Harry</PER> was tired out after training.
“ <PER>Snape</PER>’s refereeing?” <PER>Snape</PER> spluttered through a mouthful of mud.
“We’ve just got to make sure We play a clean game, so <PER>Snape</PER> hasn’t got an excuse to pick on We.” Which was all very well, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had another reason for not wanting <PER>Snape</PER> near <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER> was playing Quidditch.
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but <PER>Harry</PER> headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> playing chess.
Chess was the only thing <PER>Hermione</PER> ever lost at, something <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> thought was very good for her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said <PER>Ron</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> sat down next to <PER>Harry</PER>, “I need to concern” <PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s legs sprang apart and <PER>Neville</PER>’s got to <PER>Neville</PER>’s's feet, trembling.
“What happened?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked him, leading him over to sit with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> shakily.
“Report him!” <PER>Neville</PER> shook <PER>Neville</PER>'s head.
“You’ve got to stand up to him, <PER>Neville</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of He and make it easier.” “There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s already done that,” <PER>Neville</PER> choked out.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt in the pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and pulled out a <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog, the very last one from the box <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> for Christmas.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave it to <PER>Neville</PER>, who looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> might cry.
“You’re worth twelve of <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
Then He looked up at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in shis arms.
“I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.” “Light?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> told him to be quiet until <PER>Hermione</PER>’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
At last <PER>Hermione</PER> found what <PER>Hermione</PER> was looking for.
“The what?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“See?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had finished.
“He’s not exactly recent if He’s six hundred and sixty-five, is He?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one.
It wasn’t until <PER>Ron</PER> said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that <PER>Harry</PER> remembered about <PER>Snape</PER> and the coming match.
“I’m going to play,” he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
As the match drew nearer, however, <PER>Harry</PER> became more and more nervous, whatever <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know whether <PER>Harry</PER> was imagining it or not, but <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to keep running into <PER>Snape</PER> wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went.
At times, <PER>Harry</PER> even wondered whether <PER>Snape</PER> was following <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to catch <PER>Harry</PER> on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, <PER>Snape</PER> was so horrible to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t see how <PER>Harry</PER> could — yet <PER>Harry</PER> sometimes had the horrible feeling that <PER>Snape</PER> could read minds.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew, when they wished <PER>Harry</PER> good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again.
<PER>Harry</PER> hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to <PER>Neville</PER>, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match.
Little did <PER>Harry</PER> know that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.
They’d gotten the idea from <PER>Malfoy</PER> using it on <PER>Neville</PER>, and were ready to use it on <PER>Snape</PER> if <PER>Snape</PER> showed any sign of wanting to hurt <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” <PER>Hermione</PER> muttered as <PER>Ron</PER> slipped his wand up his sleeve.
“Even — blimey — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s come to watch!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart did a somersault.
There was simply no way that <PER>Snape</PER> would dare to try to hurt <PER>Harry</PER> if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was watching.
Perhaps that was why <PER>Snape</PER> was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that <PER>Ron</PER> noticed, too.
“I’ve never seen <PER>Snape</PER> look so mean,” <PER>Snape</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> loudly a few minutes later, as <PER>Snape</PER> awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but <PER>Ron</PER>, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell his, <PER>Neville</PER>.” “Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and that’s saying something.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m warning you, <PER>Malfoy</PER> — one more word — ” “<PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly, “<PER>Harry</PER> — !” “What?
<PER>Hermione</PER> stood up, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s crossed fingers in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth, as <PER>Harry</PER> streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
Before <PER>Malfoy</PER> knew what was happening, <PER>Ron</PER> was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground.
<PER>Neville</PER> hesitated, then clambered over the back of <PER>Neville</PER>'s seat to help.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as <PER>Harry</PER> sped straight at <PER>Snape</PER> — <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t even notice <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> rolling around under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was <PER>Neville</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle.
Up in the air, <PER>Snape</PER> turned on <PER>Snape</PER>'s broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the next second, <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled out of the dive, <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom, a foot from the ground.
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw <PER>Snape</PER> land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then <PER>Harry</PER> felt a hand on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and looked up into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s smiling face.
“Well done,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly, so that only <PER>Harry</PER> could hear.
Jc Jc Jc <PER>Harry</PER> left the locker room alone some time later, to take Jc Jc Jc <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed.
He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in He's head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the distance, jumping up and down, <PER>Ron</PER> cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s victory faded from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind as <PER>Harry</PER> watched.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.
Gliding silently over the castle <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Snape</PER> enter the forest at a run.
The trees were so thick <PER>Snape</PER> couldn’t see where <PER>Snape</PER> had gone.
<PER>Snape</PER> flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until <PER>Snape</PER> heard voices.
<PER>Snape</PER> climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to <PER>Snape</PER>'s broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Snape</PER> wasn’t alone.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t make out the look on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, but <PER>Harry</PER> was stuttering worse than ever.
<PER>Snape</PER> interrupted <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Have you found out how to get past that beast of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s yet?” “B-b-but Severus, I — ” “You don’t want me as your enemy, <PER>Quirrell</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, taking a step toward him.
<PER>Harry</PER> steadied <PER>Harry</PER> in time to hear <PER>Snape</PER> say, “ — your little bit of hocus-pocus.
It was almost dark now, but <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Quirrell</PER>, standing quite still as though <PER>Harry</PER> was petrified.
Jc Jc Jc “<PER>Harry</PER>, where have you been?” <PER>Hermione</PER> squeaked.
“And I gave <PER>Malfoy</PER> a black eye, and <PER>Neville</PER> tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and <PER>Snape</PER>’s trying to force <PER>Quirrell</PER> to help him get it.
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
<PER>Snape</PER> was sweeping about in <PER>Snape</PER>'s usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe.
Whenever <PER>Harry</PER> passed <PER>Quirrell</PER> these days <PER>Harry</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> an encouraging sort of smile, and <PER>Ron</PER> had started telling people off for laughing at <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s stutter.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, had more on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all <PER>Hermione</PER>'s notes.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn’t have minded, but <PER>Hermione</PER> kept nagging them to do the same.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, the exams are ages away.” “Ten weeks,” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped.
Moaning and yawning, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard <PER>Ron</PER> say, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>!
“Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?” “There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” “SHHHH!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> again.
“We wondered who <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had trusted enough to help <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, apart from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s chest swelled at these last words.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> beamed at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that let’s see he borrowed Fluffy from me then some o’ the teachers did enchantments Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> — ” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER> — an’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> himself did somethin’, o’ course.
“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> anxiously.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> — what’s that?” But <PER>Harry</PER> already knew what it was.
“Ah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, fiddling nervously with his beard, “That’s — er ” “Where did you get it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had now started making study schedules for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, too.
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought <PER>Harry</PER> another note from <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?” “We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s going to be in when someone finds out what someone’s doing — ” “Shut up!” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was only a few feet away and <PER>Malfoy</PER> had stopped dead to listen.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like the look on <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face at all.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, <PER>Hermione</PER> agreed to run down to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s with the other two during morning break.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from exactly?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s face — exactly?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> leapt to exactly?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s feet and ran to the window.
Something about the smile lurking on <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face during the next week made <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> very nervous.
They spent most of They's free time in <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s.
“Set <PER>Harry</PER> free.” “I can’t,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert’s going to be as long as your house.
“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, can’t.” <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly turned to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“How about it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” And in the end, <PER>Hagrid</PER> agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.
Wednesday night found <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
<PER>Ron</PER> appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>’s Invisibility Cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been down at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, helping <PER>Harry</PER> feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find <PER>Ron</PER> in a terrible state in bed.
“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, but this didn’t soothe <PER>Ron</PER> at all.
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book <PER>Malfoy</PER> took, that book <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t get a chance to answer.
“It’s too late to change the plan now,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would have felt sorry for <PER>Hagrid</PER> when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t been so worried about what <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had to do.
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> sobbed, as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had <PER>Malfoy</PER> by the ear.
Charlie’s friends showed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the harness they’d rigged up, so Charlie’s friends could suspend Norbert between They.
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.
When Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> appeared, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was leading <PER>Neville</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Neville</PER> burst out, the moment <PER>Neville</PER> saw the other two.
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard <PER>Malfoy</PER> saying <PER>Malfoy</PER> was going to catch you, <PER>Malfoy</PER> said you had a drag — ” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head violently to shut <PER>Neville</PER> up, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had seen.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> towered over the three of them.
Poor, blundering <PER>Neville</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> knew what it must have cost — <PER>Harry</PER> to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.
“Fifty points each,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, breathing heavily through Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s long, pointed nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the bottom had dropped out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Neville</PER> sobbing into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillow for what seemed like hours.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Neville</PER>, like <PER>Harry</PER>, was dreading the dawn.
And then the story started to spread: <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, the famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but <PER>Harry</PER> swore to <PER>Harry</PER> not to meddle in things that weren’t <PER>Harry</PER>'s business from now on.
The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to <PER>Harry</PER> during practice, and if they had to speak about <PER>Harry</PER>, they called <PER>Harry</PER> “the Seeker.” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were suffering, too.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had stopped drawing attention to <PER>Hermione</PER> in class, keeping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head down and working in silence.
All the studying <PER>Harry</PER> had to do kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind off his misery.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept to He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.
Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, <PER>Harry</PER>’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern <PER>Harry</PER> was put to an unexpected test.
Walking back from the library on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own one afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER> heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.
As <PER>Harry</PER> drew closer, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s voice.
Next second, <PER>Quirrell</PER> came hurrying out of the classroom straightening <PER>Quirrell</PER>'s turban.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> was pale and looked as though <PER>Quirrell</PER> was about to cry.
He strode out of sight; <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t think <PER>Quirrell</PER> had even noticed <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was halfway toward it before <PER>Harry</PER> remembered what <PER>Harry</PER>’d promised <PER>Harry</PER> about not meddling.
All the same, <PER>Harry</PER>’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that <PER>Snape</PER> had just left the room, and from what <PER>Harry</PER> had just heard, <PER>Snape</PER> would be walking with a new spring in <PER>Snape</PER>'s step — <PER>Quirrell</PER> seemed to have given in at last.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back to the library, where <PER>Hermione</PER> was testing <PER>Ron</PER> on Astronomy.
<PER>Harry</PER> told them what <PER>Harry</PER>’d heard.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s done it, then!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“If <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s told him how to break him's Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Maybe <PER>Snape</PER>’s found out how to get past <PER>Snape</PER> without asking <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them.
“If us just do a bit of poking around — ” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled a map of Jupiter toward <PER>Harry</PER> and started to learn the names of its moons.
The following morning, notes were delivered to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> at the breakfast table.
Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they’d lost.
Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> half expected <PER>Hermione</PER> to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t say a word.
Like <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER> felt they deserved what they’d got.
At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to <PER>Ron</PER> in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had also forgotten that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had gotten a detention, too.
Ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> could see the lighted windows of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut.
“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard.” <PER>Neville</PER> clutched the sleeve of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robe and made a choking noise.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> now turned to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to hear the note of panic in <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
“So me, <PER>Harry</PER>, an’ <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll go one way an’ <PER>Draco</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, an’ Fang’ll go the other.
A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> took the left path while <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Fang took the right.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> looked very worried.
“You all right, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> whispered.
“Don’ worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s jaws dropped.
“Oh, it’s you, <PER>Ron</PER>an,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> in relief.
“Good evening to you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>an.
“Were you going to shoot me?” “Can’t be too careful, <PER>Ron</PER>an,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, patting his crossbow.
“Listen, I’m glad we’ve run inter yeh, <PER>Ron</PER>an, ’cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?” <PER>Ron</PER>an didn’t answer immediately.
“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” “Yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “but have yeh seen anythin’, <PER>Ron</PER>an?
At last, <PER>Ron</PER>an said, “The forest hides many secrets.” A movement in the trees behind <PER>Ron</PER>an made <PER>Hagrid</PER> raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than <PER>Ron</PER>an.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept looking nervously over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very glad they had <PER>Hagrid</PER> and his crossbow with they.
they had just passed a bend in the path when <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s arm.
“I don’t care if <PER>Malfoy</PER> has, but if something’s got <PER>Neville</PER> it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.” The minutes dragged by.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Fang were with him.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, it seemed, had sneaked up behind <PER>Neville</PER> and grabbed <PER>Neville</PER> as a joke.
“Look — ” <PER>Harry</PER> murmured, holding out his arm to stop <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made <PER>Harry</PER> freeze where <PER>Harry</PER> stood.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and Fang stood transfixed.
It got to It feet and came swiftly toward <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — couldn’t move for fear.
The pain in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head was so bad <PER>Harry</PER> fell to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees.
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
He looked carefully at <PER>Harry</PER>, He's eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
<PER>Ron</PER>an and Bane came bursting through the trees, <PER>Ron</PER>an and Bane's flanks heaving and sweaty.
“What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?” Firenze slowed to a walk, warned <PER>Harry</PER> to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer <PER>Harry</PER>’s question.
They made They's way through the trees in silence for so long that <PER>Harry</PER> thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to <PER>Harry</PER> anymore.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, startled by the odd question.
“I’m fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, hardly knowing what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying.
“The unicorn’s dead, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, it’s in that clearing back there.” “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as <PER>Hagrid</PER> hurried off to examine the unicorn.
“You are safe now.” <PER>Harry</PER> slid off <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when <PER>Harry</PER> roughly shook <PER>Harry</PER> awake.
In a matter of seconds, though, He was wide- eyed as <PER>Harry</PER> began to tell him and <PER>Hermione</PER> what had happened in the forest.
“<PER>Snape</PER> wants the Stone for <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s waiting in the forest and all this time we thought “<PER>Snape</PER> just wanted to get rich.
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is <PER>Snape</PER> to steal the Stone,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on feverishly, “then <PER>Voldemort</PER> will be able to come and finish me off.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, everyone says <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s the only one <PER>Voldemort</PER> was ever afraid of.
When <PER>Harry</PER> pulled back <PER>Harry</PER>'s sheets, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them.
In years to come, <PER>Harry</PER> would never quite remember how <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to get through <PER>Harry</PER>'s exams when <PER>Harry</PER> half expected <PER>Voldemort</PER> to come bursting through the door at any moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> did the best <PER>Harry</PER> could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead, which had been bothering <PER>Harry</PER> ever since <PER>Harry</PER>'s trip into the forest.
<PER>Neville</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had a bad case of exam nerves because <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that <PER>Harry</PER> kept being woken by <PER>Harry</PER>'s old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as <PER>Harry</PER>.
The idea of <PER>Voldemort</PER> certainly scared them, but <PER>Voldemort</PER> didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and them were so busy with them's studying them didn’t have much time to fret about what <PER>Snape</PER> or anyone else might be up to.
“I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” <PER>Hermione</PER> always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but <PER>Ron</PER> said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.
“You could look more cheerful, <PER>Harry</PER>, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” <PER>Harry</PER> was rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, relax, <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s around.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tried to explain this, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “That’s just the exams.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> would never betray <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy never but — <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly jumped to — <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“We’ve got to go and see <PER>Hagrid</PER>, now.” “Why?” panted <PER>Hermione</PER>, hurrying to keep up.
“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what <PER>Hagrid</PER> wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket?
“We’ve got to go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either <PER>Snape</PER> or <PER>Voldemort</PER> under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got <PER>Hagrid</PER> drunk.
They had never been told where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lived, nor did They know anyone who had been sent to see <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“We want to see Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, rather bravely, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> thought.
“See Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s gone?” said <PER>Harry</PER> frantically.
“Now?” “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is a very great wizard, Potter, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has many demands on Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had expected, it wasn’t that.
“It’s tonight,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, once he was sure Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was out of earshot.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> wheeled round.
“We were — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began, without any idea what <PER>Harry</PER> was going to say.
“One of us has got to keep an eye on <PER>Snape</PER> — wait outside the staffroom and follow <PER>Snape</PER> — if <PER>Snape</PER> — leaves it.
“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER>.
No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> turned up again and this time, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> lost Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s temper.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just said, “At least <PER>Hermione</PER>’s on <PER>Snape</PER>’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and <PER>Hermione</PER> came in.
“<PER>Snape</PER> came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and <PER>Snape</PER> went to get <PER>Snape</PER>, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where <PER>Snape</PER> went.” “Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“After what <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER> have said?
“You’re right, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a small voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> didn’t talk much.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out the cloak and then <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes fell on the flute <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given the flute <PER>Hagrid</PER> for Christmas.
<PER>Harry</PER> pocketed it to use on Fluffy — <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel much like singing.
<PER>Neville</PER> appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though <PER>Neville</PER>’d been making another bid for freedom.
“Nothing, <PER>Neville</PER>, nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, hurriedly putting the cloak behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
“I’ll — I’ll fight you!” “<PER>Neville</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot — ” “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, you don’t know what you’re doing.” <PER>Neville</PER> took a step forward and <PER>Neville</PER> dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.
“I’m ready!” <PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh, <PER>Neville</PER>, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, <PER>Neville</PER>, no time to explain,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’ll understand later, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.
“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear, but <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“Brilliant, <PER>Harry</PER>!” whispered <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, there you are,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quietly, “<PER>Snape</PER>’s already got past Fluffy.” Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them.
“<PER>Snape</PER> must have left it there.” “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Keep playing,” <PER>Ron</PER> warned <PER>Harry</PER> as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor.
“Want to go first, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “No, I don’t!” “All right.” <PER>Ron</PER> gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.” <PER>Harry</PER>, who was still playing the flute, waved at <PER>Ron</PER> to get his attention and pointed at his.
<PER>Hermione</PER> landed on <PER>Harry</PER>’s other side.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had to struggle because the moment <PER>Hermione</PER> had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around <PER>Hermione</PER>'s ankles.
As for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had managed to free <PER>Hermione</PER> before the plant got a firm grip on <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried, wringing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands.
“ARE YOU A “Oh, right!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> whipped out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, waved wand, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on <PER>Snape</PER> at the plant.
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “and lucky <PER>Harry</PER> doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when <PER>Hermione</PER> tried <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Alohomora Charm.
“That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.” <PER>Ron</PER> went speeding in the direction that <PER>Harry</PER> was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
“We’ve got to close in on it!” <PER>Harry</PER> called, not taking <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes off the key with the damaged wing.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, you come at it from above — <PER>Hermione</PER>, stay below and stop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s cheers landed quickly, and <PER>Harry</PER> ran to the door, the key struggling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“Ready?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked the other two, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand on the door handle.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.
“Just tell us what to do.” “Well, <PER>Harry</PER>, you take the place of that bishop, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, you go there instead of that castle.” “What about you?” “I’m going to be a knight,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took.
Twice, <PER>Ron</PER> only just noticed in time that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were in danger.
“Yes ” said <PER>Ron</PER> softly, “it’s the only way I’ve got to be taken.” “NO!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shouted.
the white queen struck <PER>Ron</PER> hard across the head with the white queen's stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed but stayed on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s square — the white queen dragged <PER>Ron</PER> to one side.
With one last desperate look back at <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> charged through the door and up the next passageway.
“What do you reckon’s next?” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; <PER>McGonagall</PER> transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s spell, and <PER>Snape</PER>’s ” them had reached another door.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Cho</PER>ose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, us give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a great sigh and <PER>Harry</PER>, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
“I might get lucky again.” <PER>Hermione</PER>’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at <PER>Harry</PER> and threw shis arms around <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>l” “<PER>Harry</PER> — you’re a great wizard, you know.” “I’m not as good as you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.
“Here I come,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER> drained the little bottle in one gulp.
“I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.” “But I thought — <PER>Snape</PER> — ” “Severus?” <PER>Quirrell</PER> laughed, and it wasn’t <PER>Quirrell</PER>'s usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.
“I saw you and <PER>Snape</PER> in the forest — ” <PER>Snape</PER> blurted out.
“I see the Stone I’m presenting it to my master but where is it?” <PER>Harry</PER> struggled against the ropes binding <PER>Harry</PER>, but they didn’t give.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to keep <PER>Quirrell</PER> from giving <PER>Harry</PER>'s whole attention to the mirror.
“But <PER>Snape</PER> always seemed to hate me so much.” “Oh, <PER>Snape</PER> does,” said <PER>Quirrell</PER> casually, “heavens, yes.
“<PER>Snape</PER> is with me wherever I go,” said <PER>Quirrell</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> was remembering <PER>Harry</PER>'s trip to Diagon Alley — how could <PER>Harry</PER> have been so stupid?
<PER>Harry</PER>’d seen <PER>Quirrell</PER> there that very day, shaken hands with <PER>Harry</PER> in the Leaky Cauldron.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> ignored <PER>Quirrell</PER>.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> was still talking to <PER>Quirrell</PER>.
“Use the boy Use the boy ” <PER>Quirrell</PER> rounded on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> got slowly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.” <PER>Harry</PER> walked toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s turban.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.
It winked and put the Stone back in the Stone pocket — and as it did so, <PER>Harry</PER> felt something heavy drop into <PER>Harry</PER>'s real pocket.
“What do you see?” <PER>Harry</PER> screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s courage.
As <PER>Harry</PER> moved aside, <PER>Harry</PER> felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have screamed, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t make a sound.
Where there should have been a back to <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to take a step backward but <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs wouldn’t move.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> was walking backward at him, so that <PER>Voldemort</PER> could still see <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar; <PER>Harry</PER>'s head felt as though it was about to split in two; <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, struggling with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might, and to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surprise, <PER>Quirrell</PER> let go of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!” And <PER>Quirrell</PER>, though pinning <PER>Harry</PER> to the ground with <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, let go of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck and stared, bewildered, at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own palms — <PER>Harry</PER> could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but <PER>Harry</PER>, by instinct, reached up and grabbed <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s face — <PER>Quirrell</PER> rolled off him, him's face blistering, too, and then <PER>Harry</PER> knew: <PER>Quirrell</PER> couldn’t touch <PER>Harry</PER>'s bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of <PER>Quirrell</PER>, keep his in enough pain to stop his from doing a curse.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, caught <PER>Quirrell</PER> by the arm, and hung on as tight as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> screamed and tried to throw <PER>Harry</PER> off — the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head was building — <PER>Quirrell</PER> couldn’t see — <PER>Quirrell</PER> could only hear <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s terrible shrieks and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
The smiling face of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> swam into view above Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Good afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I’ve been thinking Sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “Call him <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.
When he had found his voice again, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent it to me?” “Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyes twinkled.
“Useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.” “And there’s something else ” “Fire away.” “<PER>Quirrell</PER> said <PER>Snape</PER> — ” “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Yes, him — <PER>Quirrell</PER> said him — <PER>Quirrell</PER> hates me because him — <PER>Quirrell</PER> hated my father.
“But five minutes only.” And she let <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in.
“<PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked ready to fling <PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arms around him again, but <PER>Harry</PER> was glad <PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Hermione</PER> held <PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Hermione</PER> in as <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was still very sore.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>, we were sure you were going to — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was so worried — ” “The whole school’s talking about it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> told them everything: <PER>Quirrell</PER>; the mirror; the Stone; and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were a very good audience; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped in all the right places, and when <PER>Harry</PER> told them what was under <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s turban, <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed out loud.
“I brought <PER>Ron</PER> round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when we met <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘<PER>Harry</PER>’s gone after <PER>Harry</PER>, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” “D’you think he meant you to do it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” “Well,” <PER>Hermione</PER> exploded, “if he did — I mean to say — that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” “No, it isn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER> thoughtfully.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s a funny man, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I can, can’t “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says you are to be allowed to go,” she said sniffily, as though in shis opinion Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t realize how risky feasts could be.
he sat down next to <PER>Harry</PER>, took one look at <PER>Harry</PER>, and burst into tears.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, he’d have found out somehow, this is <PER>Voldemort</PER> we’re talking about, he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told ’d.” “Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“An’ don’ say the name!” “VOLDEMORT!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was so shocked, <PER>Harry</PER> stopped crying.
“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer photos knew yeh didn’ have any d’yeh like it?” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t speak, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> understood.
<PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving <PER>Harry</PER> one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped into a seat between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> banging <PER>Harry</PER>'s goblet on the table.
“Second — to Miss <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” <PER>Hermione</PER> buried <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arms; <PER>Harry</PER> strongly suspected she had burst into tears.
“Third — to Mister <PER>Harry</PER> Potter ” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
themselves had tied for the House Cup — if only <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> just one more point.
only <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood up to yell and cheer as <PER>Neville</PER>, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.
<PER>Harry</PER>, still cheering, nudged <PER>Ron</PER> in the ribs and pointed at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if <PER>Harry</PER>’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on he.
<PER>Snape</PER> was shaking Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile.
<PER>Snape</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and <PER>Harry</PER> knew at once that <PER>Snape</PER> ’s feelings toward <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t changed one jot.
To their great surprise, both he and <PER>Ron</PER> passed with good marks; <PER>Hermione</PER>, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
Even <PER>Neville</PER> scraped through, Even <PER>Neville</PER>'s good Herbology mark making up for Even <PER>Neville</PER>'s abysmal Potions one.
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, <PER>Neville</PER>’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); <PER>Hagrid</PER> was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
“You must come and stay this summer,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled them as them moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.
Some of them called: “Bye, <PER>Harry</PER>!” “See you, Potter!” “Still famous,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning at him.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> passed through the gateway together.
“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!” It was <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, <PER>Ron</PER>’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at <PER>Ron</PER>.
Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER>, looking terrified at the very sight of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hung back for a last word with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh, I will,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
