At half past eight, Vernon picked up Vernon's briefcase, pecked Petunia on the cheek, and tried to kiss <PER>Dudley</PER> good-bye but missed, because <PER>Dudley</PER> was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.
Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t seem to realize that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had just arrived in a street where everything from Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s name to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s boots was unwelcome.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> slipped the Put- Outer back inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat down on the wall next to the cat.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t look at it, but after a moment <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke to it.
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“As I say, even if <PER>Voldemort</PER> has gone — ” “My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call <PER>Voldemort</PER> by <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s name?
“It all gets so confusing if we keep saying <PER>Voldemort</PER>.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name.” “I know you haven’t,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave a great sniff as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> took a golden watch from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s pocket and examined it.
It must have made sense to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s late.
“And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?” “I’ve come to bring <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt and uncle.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s older.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s bringing him.” “You think it — wise — to trust <PER>Hagrid</PER> with something as important as this?” “I would trust <PER>Hagrid</PER> with my life,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sounding relieved.
sir bent sir's great, shaggy head over <PER>Harry</PER> and gave <PER>Harry</PER> what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.
“Shhh!” hissed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it.
“But I c-c- can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little <PER>Harry</PER> off ter live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, or we’ll be found,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> whispered, patting <PER>Hagrid</PER> gingerly on the arm as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> laid <PER>Harry</PER> gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s cloak, tucked a letter inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s blankets, and then came back to the other two.
For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s shoulders shook, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, nodding to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter rolled over inside <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's blankets without waking up.
Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but <PER>Dudley</PER> Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding <PER>Dudley</PER> Dursley's first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with <PER>Dudley</PER> Dursley's father, being hugged and kissed by <PER>Dudley</PER> Dursley's mother.
<PER>Harry</PER> rolled onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s back and tried to remember the dream <PER>Harry</PER> had been having.
<PER>Harry</PER> found a pair under <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on.
<PER>Harry</PER> was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of spiders, and that was where <PER>Harry</PER> slept.
When <PER>Harry</PER> was dressed <PER>Harry</PER> went down the hall into the kitchen.
Exactly why <PER>Dudley</PER> wanted a racing bike was a mystery to <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Dudley</PER> was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody.
<PER>Dudley</PER>’s favorite punching bag was <PER>Harry</PER>, but he couldn’t often catch <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t look it, but <PER>Harry</PER> was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but <PER>Harry</PER> had always been small and skinny for <PER>Harry</PER>'s age.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked even smaller and skinnier than <PER>Harry</PER> really was because all <PER>Harry</PER> had to wear were old clothes of <PER>Dudley</PER>’s, and <PER>Dudley</PER> was about four times bigger than <PER>Harry</PER> was.
<PER>Harry</PER> wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times <PER>Dudley</PER> had punched him on the nose.
The only thing <PER>Harry</PER> liked about <PER>Harry</PER>'s own appearance was a very thin scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
<PER>Harry</PER> must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in <PER>Harry</PER>'s class put together, but it made no difference, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair simply grew that way — all over the place.
<PER>Harry</PER> was frying eggs by the time <PER>Dudley</PER> arrived in the kitchen with <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother.
Aunt Petunia often said that <PER>Dudley</PER> looked like a baby angel — <PER>Harry</PER> often said that <PER>Dudley</PER> looked like a pig in a wig.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who could see a huge <PER>Dudley</PER> tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case <PER>Dudley</PER> turned the table over.
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while <PER>Harry</PER> and Uncle Vernon watched <PER>Dudley</PER> unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.
<PER>Dudley</PER>’s mouth fell open in horror, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart gave a leap.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> ought to feel sorry that Mistress Figg had broken Mistress Figg's leg, but it wasn’t easy when <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER> it would be a whole year before <PER>Harry</PER> had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mister Paws, and Tufty again.
“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.” The Dursleys often spoke about <PER>Harry</PER> like this, as though <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t there — or rather, as though <PER>Harry</PER> was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.
“You could just leave me here,” <PER>Harry</PER> put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what <PER>Harry</PER> wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on <PER>Dudley</PER>’s computer) .
“I suppose we could take <PER>Harry</PER> to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, "and leave <PER>Harry</PER> in the car.” “That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone.” <PER>Dudley</PER> began to cry loudly.
Half an hour later, <PER>Harry</PER>, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and <PER>Dudley</PER>, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.
“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to <PER>Harry</PER>’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.” I’m not going to do anything,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “honestly But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him.
Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s great relief, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t punished.
<PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to <PER>Harry</PER>’s surprise as anyone else’s, there <PER>Harry</PER> was sitting on the chimney.
The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from <PER>Harry</PER>’s headmistress telling them <PER>Harry</PER> had been climbing school buildings.
<PER>Harry</PER> supposed that the wind must have caught <PER>Harry</PER> in mid-jump.
Uncle Vernon liked to complain about things: people at work, <PER>Harry</PER>, the council, <PER>Harry</PER>, the bank, and <PER>Harry</PER> were just a few of Uncle Vernon's favorite subjects.
Uncle Vernon turned right around in Uncle Vernon's seat and yelled at <PER>Harry</PER>, He's face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: <PER>Dudley</PER> and Piers sniggered.
The Dursleys bought <PER>Dudley</PER> and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked <PER>Harry</PER> what <PER>Harry</PER> wanted before they could hurry <PER>Harry</PER> away, they bought <PER>Harry</PER> a cheap lemon ice pop.
It wasn’t bad, either, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like <PER>Dudley</PER>, except that it wasn’t blond.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the best morning <PER>Harry</PER>’d had in a long time.
<PER>Harry</PER> was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that <PER>Dudley</PER> and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting <PER>Harry</PER>.
They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when <PER>Dudley</PER> had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought <PER>Harry</PER> another one and <PER>Harry</PER> was allowed to finish the first.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt, afterward, that <PER>Harry</PER> should have known it was all too good to last.
It gave <PER>Harry</PER> a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.” “I know,” <PER>Harry</PER> murmured through the glass, though <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure the snake could hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But the glass,” <PER>Harry</PER> kept saying, “where did the glass go?” " The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while <PER>Harry</PER> apologized over and over again.
As far as <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, <PER>Dudley</PER> was telling they how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.
But worst of all, for <PER>Harry</PER> at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “<PER>Harry</PER> was talking to it, weren’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dark cupboard much later, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> had a watch.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know what time it was and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.
After asking <PER>Harry</PER> furiously if <PER>Harry</PER> knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.
Everybody knew that <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang hated that odd <PER>Harry</PER> Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang.
<PER>Harry</PER> was glad school was over, but there was no escaping <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang, who visited the house every single day.
The rest of them were all quite happy to join in <PER>Dudley</PER>’s favorite sport: <PER>Harry</PER> Hunting.
This was why <PER>Harry</PER> spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where <PER>Harry</PER> could see a tiny ray of hope.
When September came <PER>Harry</PER> would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t be with <PER>Dudley</PER>.
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took <PER>Dudley</PER> to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> at Mistress Figg’s.
She let <PER>Harry</PER> watch television and gave <PER>Harry</PER> a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though She’d had it for several years.
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said Aunt Petunia couldn’t believe it was Aunt Petunia's Ickle <PER>Dudley</PER>kins, Ickle <PER>Dudley</PER>kins looked so handsome and grown-up.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t trust <PER>Harry</PER> to speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought two of <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.
<PER>Dudley</PER> and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from <PER>Harry</PER>’s new uniform.
“Make <PER>Harry</PER> get it.” “Get the mail, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Make <PER>Dudley</PER> get it.” “Poke him with your Smelting stick, <PER>Dudley</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked it up and stared at it, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart twanging like a giant elastic band.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back to the kitchen, still staring at <PER>Harry</PER>'s letter.
“Dad, <PER>Harry</PER>’s got something!” <PER>Harry</PER> was on the point of unfolding <PER>Harry</PER>'s letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand by Uncle Vernon.
“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and OUT!” took both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dudley</PER> by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dudley</PER> promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; <PER>Dudley</PER> won, so <PER>Harry</PER>, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
“Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where <PER>Dudley</PER> slept, and one where <PER>Dudley</PER> kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom.
It only took <PER>Harry</PER> one trip upstairs to move everything <PER>Harry</PER> owned from the cupboard to this room.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down on the bed and stared around <PER>Harry</PER>.
The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank <PER>Dudley</PER> had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was <PER>Dudley</PER>’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that <PER>Dudley</PER> had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because <PER>Dudley</PER> had sat on it.
<PER>Harry</PER> was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing <PER>Harry</PER>’d opened the letter in the hall.
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to <PER>Harry</PER>, made <PER>Dudley</PER> go and get it.
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle <PER>Dudley</PER> to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.
After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with <PER>Harry</PER>’s letter clutched in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“<PER>Dudley</PER> — go — just go.” <PER>Harry</PER> walked round and round <PER>Harry</PER>'s new room.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart hammered as <PER>Harry</PER> crept across the dark hall toward the front door — <PER>Harry</PER> leapt into the air; — <PER>Harry</PER>’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive\ Lights clicked on upstairs and to — <PER>Harry</PER>'s horror — <PER>Harry</PER> realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face.
Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t do exactly what <PER>Harry</PER>’d been trying to do.
Uncle Vernon shouted at <PER>Harry</PER> for about half an hour and then told <PER>Harry</PER> to go and make a cup of tea.
<PER>Harry</PER> shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time <PER>Harry</PER> got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap.
Twenty-four letters to <PER>Harry</PER> found Twenty-four letters to <PER>Harry</PER>'s way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that Twenty-four letters to <PER>Harry</PER>'s very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window.
“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” <PER>Dudley</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> in amazement.
When Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER> had run out with Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER>'s arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.
<PER>Dudley</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.
<PER>Dudley</PER> snored but <PER>Harry</PER> stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.
If it was Monday — and you could usually count on <PER>Dudley</PER> to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was <PER>Harry</PER>’s eleventh birthday.
<PER>Harry</PER> privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer <PER>Harry</PER> up at all.
She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and <PER>Harry</PER> was left to find the softest bit of floor <PER>Harry</PER> could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
<PER>Harry</PER> shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach rumbling with hunger.
The lighted dial of <PER>Dudley</PER>’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on <PER>Dudley</PER>’s's fat wrist, told <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Dudley</PER>’s’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time.
<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Dudley</PER>’s’d lay and watched <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Dudley</PER>’s’d's birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
<PER>Harry</PER> hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although <PER>Harry</PER> might be warmer if it did.
Thirty seconds twenty ten nine — maybe he’d wake <PER>Dudley</PER> up, just to annoy he — three two one The whole shack shivered and <PER>Harry</PER> sat bolt upright, staring at the door.
“Anyway — <PER>Harry</PER>,” said the giant, turning — <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh.
<PER>Harry</PER> meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, and what <PER>Harry</PER> said instead was, “Who are you?” the giant chuckled.
It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the warmth wash over <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d sunk into a hot bath.
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> stared wildly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Yours sincerely, Minerva <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head like fireworks and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t decide which to ask first.
After a few minutes <PER>Harry</PER> stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
With his tongue between his teeth his scribbled a note that <PER>Harry</PER> could read upside down: Dear Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Given <PER>Harry</PER> his letter.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> <PER>Hagrid</PER> rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth was open and closed his mouth quickly.
As soon as <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Blown up?
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped; <PER>Harry</PER> had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.
Now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had been upset or angry chased by <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang, him had somehow found him out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, him’d managed to make it grow back and the very last time <PER>Dudley</PER> had hit him, hadn’t him got him's revenge, without even realizing him was doing it?
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, smiling, and saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was positively beaming at him.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> seized his umbrella and whirled his umbrella over his head, “NEVER — ” he thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE DUMBLEDORE brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at <PER>Dudley</PER> — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, <PER>Dudley</PER> was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> could tell it was daylight, <PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes shut tight.
And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart sinking.
But <PER>Harry</PER> still didn’t open <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
“All right,” <PER>Harry</PER> mumbled, “I’m getting up.” <PER>Harry</PER> sat up and <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s heavy coat fell off <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, so happy <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Don’t do that.” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to wave The owl out of the way, but The owl snapped the owl beak fiercely at <PER>Harry</PER> and carried on savaging the coat.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly.
“Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.” <PER>Harry</PER> counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg so <PER>Harry</PER> could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.
“Best be off, <PER>Harry</PER>, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” <PER>Harry</PER> was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just thought of something that made <PER>Harry</PER> feel as though the happy balloon inside <PER>Harry</PER> had got a puncture.
“Urn — <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “Mm?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was pulling on his huge boots.
“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, giving <PER>Harry</PER> another of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sideways looks.
“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They wanted <PER>Dumbledore</PER> fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge got the job.
Not only was <PER>Hagrid</PER> twice as tall as anyone else, <PER>Harry</PER> kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to <PER>Harry</PER> so <PER>Harry</PER> could buy their tickets.
“Still got yer letter, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> took the parchment envelope out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket.
“There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” <PER>Harry</PER> unfolded a second piece of paper <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: o!WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY First-year students will require: 1 .
Although <PER>Hagrid</PER> seemed to know where <PER>Harry</PER> was going, <PER>Harry</PER> was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all <PER>Harry</PER> had to do was keep close behind him.
If <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, <PER>Harry</PER> might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything <PER>Hagrid</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> so far was unbelievable, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help trusting <PER>Harry</PER>.
If <PER>Hagrid</PER> hadn’t pointed it out, <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have noticed it was there.
In fact, <PER>Harry</PER> had the most peculiar feeling that only he and <PER>Hagrid</PER> could see it.
Everyone seemed to know <PER>Hagrid</PER>; Everyone waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, clapping his great hand on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder and making <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees buckle.
“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter what an honor.” He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward <PER>Harry</PER> and seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, tears in <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.
“Doris Crockford, Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” “So proud, Potter, I’m just so proud.” “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” “Delighted, Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.” “I’ve seen you before!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in <PER>Harry</PER>'s excitement.
“Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER> will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>, grasping <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>, as though he’d rather not think about it.
But the others wouldn’t let Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER> keep <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> grinned at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Welcome,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “to Diagon Alley.” He grinned at <PER>Harry</PER>’s amazement.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked quickly over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “but we gotta get yer money first.” <PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had about eight more eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing them's shopping.
Several boys of about <PER>Harry</PER>’s age had Several boys of about <PER>Harry</PER>’s age's noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.
“Look,” <PER>Harry</PER> heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> made for the counter.
“We’ve come ter take some money outta Mister <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s safe.” “You have his key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.
“That seems to be in order.” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> importantly, throwing out his chest.
Once <PER>Hagrid</PER> had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside Once <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s pockets, Once <PER>Hagrid</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but <PER>Harry</PER> kept them wide open.
Once, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
“I never know,” <PER>Harry</PER> called to <PER>Hagrid</PER> over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> pile some of it into a bag.
They went rattling over an underground ravine, and <PER>Harry</PER> leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> groaned and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> back by the scruff of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck.
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure, and <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was empty.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know where to run first now that <PER>Harry</PER> had a bag full of money.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that <PER>Harry</PER> was holding more money than <PER>Harry</PER>’d had in <PER>Harry</PER>'s whole life — more money than even <PER>Dudley</PER> had ever had.
Madam Malkin stood <PER>Harry</PER> on a stool next to <PER>Harry</PER>, slipped a long robe over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and began to pin it to the right length.
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” “Mmm,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> could say something a bit more interesting.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was standing there, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> and pointing at two large ice creams to show <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t come in.
“That’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.
<PER>Harry</PER> was rather quiet as <PER>Harry</PER> ate the ice cream <PER>Hagrid</PER> had bought <PER>Harry</PER> (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
<PER>Harry</PER> cheered up a bit when <PER>Harry</PER> found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.
When they had left the shop, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what’s Quidditch?” “Blimey, <PER>Harry</PER>, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!” “Don’t make me feel worse,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> almost had to drag <PER>Harry</PER> away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
“I was trying to find out how to curse <PER>Dudley</PER>.” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> wouldn’t let <PER>Harry</PER> buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.
While <PER>Hagrid</PER> asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
Outside the Apothecary, <PER>Hagrid</PER> checked <PER>Harry</PER>’s list again.
“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> go red.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stop stammering <PER>Harry</PER>'s thanks, sounding just like Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt strangely as though <PER>Harry</PER> had entered a very strict library; <PER>Harry</PER> swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> would blink.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> reflected in those misty eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed <PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s pink umbrella very tightly as <PER>Harry</PER> spoke.
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at people on the Underground, laden as people were with all people's funny- shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on <PER>Harry</PER>’s lap.
Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> only realized where they were when <PER>Hagrid</PER> tapped him on the shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure <PER>Harry</PER> could explain.
He’d just had the best birthday of <PER>Harry</PER>'s life — and yet — <PER>Harry</PER> chewed <PER>Harry</PER>'s hamburger, trying to find the words.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to watch <PER>Hagrid</PER> until <PER>Harry</PER> was out of sight; <PER>Harry</PER> rose in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat and pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose against the window, but <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and <PER>Hagrid</PER> had gone.
True, <PER>Dudley</PER> was now so scared of <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s cupboard, force <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> to do anything, or shout at <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> — in fact, they didn’t speak to <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> at all.
Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> in it were empty.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept to <PER>Harry</PER>'s room, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s new owl for company.
He pulled the ticket <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given the ticket <PER>Hagrid</PER> out of the ticket <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s pocket.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up and pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans because <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to walk into the station in <PER>Harry</PER>'s wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train.
Two hours later, <PER>Harry</PER>’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked <PER>Dudley</PER> into sitting next to <PER>Harry</PER>, and they had set off.
Uncle Vernon dumped <PER>Harry</PER>’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled <PER>Harry</PER>’s trunk into the station for Uncle Vernon.
a passing guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t even tell <PER>Harry</PER> what part of the country it was in, <PER>Harry</PER> started to get annoyed, as though <PER>Harry</PER> was being stupid on purpose.
According to the large clock over the arrivals board, <PER>Harry</PER> had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea how to do it; <PER>Harry</PER> was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> must have forgotten to tell <PER>Harry</PER> something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered if <PER>Harry</PER> should get out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten.
Heart hammering, <PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s cart after them.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched, careful not to blink in case <PER>Harry</PER> missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of <PER>Harry</PER> and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> was going to smash right into that barrier and then He’d be in trouble — leaning forward on <PER>Harry</PER>'s cart, <PER>Harry</PER> broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t be able to stop — the cart was out of control — <PER>Harry</PER> was a foot away — <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come <PER>Harry</PER> kept on running <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked behind <PER>Harry</PER> and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three- Quarters on it.
<PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.
<PER>Harry</PER> passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” “Oh, <PER>Neville</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> heard the old woman sigh.
<PER>Harry</PER> pressed on through the crowd until <PER>Harry</PER> found an empty compartment near the end of the train.
<PER>Harry</PER> put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk toward the train door.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice <PER>Harry</PER> dropped it painfully on <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pushing <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweaty hair out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
“I mean, yes, I am.” The two boys gawked at him, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> turning red.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down next to the window where, half hidden, <PER>Harry</PER> could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know what <PER>Harry</PER> was going to — but it had to be better than what <PER>Harry</PER> was leaving behind.
“Everywhere else is full.” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and the youngest redheaded boy sat down.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> still had a black mark on <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose.
“Are you really <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” <PER>Ron</PER> blurted out.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled back <PER>Harry</PER>'s bangs to show the lightning scar.
“So that’s where <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but I can’t remember it.” “Nothing?” said <PER>Ron</PER> eagerly.
“Are all your family wizards?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, who found <PER>Ron</PER> just as interesting as <PER>Ron</PER> found him.
After all, <PER>Harry</PER>’d never had any money in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life until a month ago, and <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> so, all about having to wear <PER>Dudley</PER>’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
and until <PER>Hagrid</PER> told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER> gasped.
“ You said <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name\” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding both shocked and impressed.
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back a smiling, dimpled woman's door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” <PER>Harry</PER>, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears went pink again and his muttered that his’d brought sandwiches.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that <PER>Harry</PER> had pockets rattling with gold and silver <PER>Harry</PER> was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as <PER>Harry</PER> could carry — but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars.
What the woman did have were Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared as <PER>Harry</PER> brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.
It was a nice feeling, sitting there with <PER>Ron</PER>, eating their way through all <PER>Harry</PER>’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
“What are these?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, holding up a pack of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frogs.
“So this is <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Weird).” <PER>Harry</PER> stared as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sidled back into the picture on <PER>Harry</PER>'s card and gave <PER>Harry</PER> a small smile.
<PER>Ron</PER> was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes off them.
Soon <PER>Harry</PER> had not only <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
“You want to be careful with those,” <PER>Ron</PER> warned <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>, and was relieved to see by <PER>Harry</PER>'s stunned face that <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
“I’m <PER>Ron</PER> Weasley,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to take <PER>Ron</PER>’s mind off Houses.
“So what do your oldest brothers do now that your oldest brothers’ve left, anyway?” <PER>Harry</PER> was wondering what a wizard did once <PER>Harry</PER>’d finished school.
his was just taking <PER>Harry</PER> through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t <PER>Neville</PER> the toadless boy, or <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger this time.
“And my names <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.” <PER>Ron</PER> gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked at him.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s pale cheeks.
“Unless you get out now,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, more bravely than <PER>Harry</PER> felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I think he’s been knocked out,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’ve met <PER>Malfoy</PER> before?” <PER>Harry</PER> explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s were a bit short for <PER>Ron</PER>’s, you could see <PER>Ron</PER>’s's sneakers underneath them.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were followed into their boat by <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“The firs’ years, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> nervously tried to flatten <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair.
Any second now, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> would come back and lead Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s doom.
“Now, form a line,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, <PER>Harry</PER> got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with <PER>Ron</PER> behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly looked down again as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, <PER>Harry</PER> thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, <PER>Harry</PER> stared at it, too.
“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Ron</PER>’s twin brothers catcalling.
Perhaps it was <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination, after all <PER>Harry</PER>’d heard about Slytherin, but <PER>Harry</PER> thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered being picked for teams during gym at <PER>Harry</PER>'s old school.
<PER>Harry</PER> had always been last to be chosen, not because <PER>Harry</PER> was no good, but because no one wanted <PER>Dudley</PER> to think they liked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Granger, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
When The hat finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” <PER>Neville</PER> ran off still wearing The hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give The hat to “MacDougal, Morag.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: The hat had barely touched his head when The hat screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.
“Moon” , “Nott” , “Parkinson” , then a pair of twin girls, “Path” and “Path” , then “Perks, Sally- Anne” , and then, at last — “Potter, <PER>Harry</PER>!” As <PER>Harry</PER> stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.
“ Potter , did she say?” “ The <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” The last thing <PER>Harry</PER> saw before the hat dropped over <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
The ghost patted The ghost's arm, giving <PER>Harry</PER> the sudden, horrible feeling <PER>Harry</PER>’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
At the end nearest <PER>Harry</PER> sat <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized <PER>Harry</PER> at once from the card <PER>Harry</PER>’d gotten out of the <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog on the train.
<PER>Harry</PER> spotted Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than <PER>Ron</PER>, joined <PER>Harry</PER> at the Gryffindor table.
<PER>Harry</PER> crossed <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” <PER>Harry</PER> clapped loudly with the rest as <PER>Ron</PER> collapsed into the chair next to GRYFFINDOR!” <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well done, <PER>Ron</PER>, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across <PER>Harry</PER> as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> rolled up Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s empty gold plate.
<PER>Harry</PER> had only just realized how hungry <PER>Harry</PER> was.
Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was beaming at the students, Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> more than to see them all there.
“Is <PER>Harry</PER> — a bit mad?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked Percy uncertainly.
The Dursleys had never exactly starved <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER>’d never been allowed to eat as much as <PER>Harry</PER> liked.
<PER>Dudley</PER> had always taken anything that <PER>Harry</PER> really wanted, even if it made <PER>Harry</PER> sick.
<PER>Harry</PER> piled <PER>Harry</PER>'s plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching <PER>Harry</PER> cut up <PER>Harry</PER>'s steak.
He was right next to <PER>Malfoy</PER> who, <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell- 0, rice pudding As <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.
“What about you, <PER>Neville</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was talking to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>, in Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>'s absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
The hook-nosed teacher looked past <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s turban straight into <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“Ouch!” <PER>Harry</PER> clapped a hand to <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
Harder to shake off was the feeling <PER>Harry</PER> had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like <PER>Harry</PER> at all.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet again.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand a little flick, as if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> conducted only the Weasley twins's last few lines with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s legs were like lead again, but only because <PER>Harry</PER> was so tired and full of food.
“Great food, isn’t it?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> through the hangings.
Perhaps <PER>Harry</PER> had eaten a bit too much, because <PER>Harry</PER> had a very strange dream.
<PER>Harry</PER> was wearing Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s turban, which kept talking to <PER>Harry</PER>, telling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was <PER>Harry</PER>'s destiny.
<PER>Harry</PER> told the turban <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; <PER>Harry</PER> tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was <PER>Malfoy</PER>, laughing at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> struggled with it — then <PER>Malfoy</PER> turned into the hook-nosed teacher, <PER>Snape</PER>, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and <PER>Harry</PER> woke, sweating and shaking.
<PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and fell asleep again, and when <PER>Harry</PER> woke next day, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t remember the dream at all.
“There, look.” “Where?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “Wearing the glasses?” “Did you see his face?” “Did you see his scar?” Whispers followed <PER>Harry</PER> from the moment <PER>Harry</PER> left <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory the next day.
People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at <PER>Harry</PER>, or doubled back to pass <PER>Harry</PER> in the corridors again, staring.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished they wouldn’t, because <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to concentrate on finding <PER>Harry</PER>'s way to classes.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been quite right to think Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> wasn’t a teacher to cross.
By the end of the lesson, only <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave <PER>Hermione</PER> a rare smile.
For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how <PER>Quirrell</PER> had fought off the zombie, <PER>Quirrell</PER> went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that <PER>Quirrell</PER> was protected wherever he went.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very relieved to find out that <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t miles behind everyone else.
Friday was an important day for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What have we got today?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> as he poured sugar on his porridge.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
<PER>Harry</PER> had gotten used to this by now, but it had given <PER>Harry</PER> a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until about a hundred owls saw about a hundred owls's owners, and dropping letters and packages onto about a hundred owls's laps.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>" <PER>Harry</PER> borrowed <PER>Ron</PER>’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that <PER>Harry</PER> had tea with <PER>Hagrid</PER> to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to <PER>Harry</PER> so far.
At the start-of-term banquet, <PER>Harry</PER> had gotten the idea that Professor <PER>Snape</PER> disliked <PER>Harry</PER>.
By the end of the first Potions lesson, <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER>’d been wrong.
<PER>Snape</PER> didn’t dislike <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — hated <PER>Harry</PER> —.
<PER>Snape</PER>, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at <PER>Harry</PER>’s name.
His eyes were black like <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s, but they had none of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s warmth.
he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER> had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger was on the edge of <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger's seat and looked desperate to start proving that <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger wasn’t a dunderhead.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked as stumped as he was; <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s hand had shot into the air.
“I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> had looked through <PER>Harry</PER>'s books at the Dursleys’, but did <PER>Snape</PER> expect <PER>Snape</PER> to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?
<PER>Snape</PER> was still ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>’s quivering hand.
“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, <PER>Hermione</PER> stood up, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
“I think <PER>Hermione</PER> does, though, why don’t you try <PER>Hermione</PER>?” A few people laughed; <PER>Harry</PER> caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked.
<PER>Snape</PER> swept around in <PER>Snape</PER>'s long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except <PER>Malfoy</PER>, whom He seemed to like.
“I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” <PER>Neville</PER> whimpered as boils started to pop up all over <PER>Neville</PER>'s nose.
Then him rounded on <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been working next to <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Don’t push it,” him muttered, “I’ve heard <PER>Snape</PER> can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind was racing and <PER>Harry</PER>'s spirits were low.
He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in He's very first week — why did <PER>Snape</PER> hate <PER>Snape</PER> so much?
“Cheer up,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “<PER>Snape</PER>’s always taking points off Fred and George.
Then <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.
“Make yerselves at home,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at <PER>Ron</PER> and started licking his ears.
“This is <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
“Another Weasley, eh?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, glancing at <PER>Ron</PER>’s freckles.
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke The rock cakes's teeth, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> pretended to be enjoying them as them told <PER>Hagrid</PER> all about them's first lessons.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were delighted to hear <PER>Hagrid</PER> call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mistress Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, like <PER>Ron</PER>, told <PER>Harry</PER> not to worry about it, that <PER>Snape</PER> liked hardly any of the students.
“Why should he?” Yet <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help thinking that <PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t quite meet <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes when <PER>Harry</PER> said that.
“How’s yer brother Charlie?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I liked him a lot — great with animals.” <PER>Harry</PER> wondered if <PER>Hagrid</PER> had changed the subject on purpose.
While <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hagrid</PER> all about Charlie’s work with dragons, <PER>Harry</PER> picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Ron</PER> telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but <PER>Ron</PER> hadn’t mentioned the date.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, <PER>Harry</PER> thought that none of the lessons <PER>Harry</PER>’d had so far had given <PER>Harry</PER> as much to think about as tea with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
And did <PER>Hagrid</PER> know something about <PER>Snape</PER> that he didn’t want to tell <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> had never believed <PER>Harry</PER> would meet a boy he hated more than <PER>Dudley</PER>, but that was before <PER>Harry</PER> met <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Anyway, I know <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> certainly did talk about flying a lot.
Even <PER>Ron</PER> would tell anyone who’d listen about the time Even <PER>Ron</PER>’d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom.
<PER>Harry</PER> had caught <PER>Ron</PER> prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.
<PER>Neville</PER> had never been on a broomstick in <PER>Neville</PER>'s life, because <PER>Neville</PER>'s grandmother had never let <PER>Neville</PER> near one.
Privately, <PER>Harry</PER> felt she’d had good reason, because <PER>Neville</PER> managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger was almost as nervous about flying as <PER>Neville</PER> was.
<PER>Neville</PER> was hanging on to shis every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to him's broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t had a single letter since <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s note, something that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been quick to notice, of course.
A barn owl brought <PER>Neville</PER> a small package from <PER>Neville</PER>'s grandmother.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> jumped to their feet.
They were half hoping for a reason to fight <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
“What’s going on?” “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” Scowling, <PER>Malfoy</PER> quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.
At three-thirty that afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s broom jumped into <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand at once, but it was one of the few that did.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and <PER>Neville</PER>’s hadn’t moved at all.
Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought <PER>Harry</PER>; there was a quaver in <PER>Neville</PER>’s voice that said only too clearly that <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet on the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were delighted when she told <PER>Malfoy</PER> he’d been doing it wrong for years.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw <PER>Harry</PER> gasp, slip sideways off the broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and <PER>Neville</PER> lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
“Give that here, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?” “Give it here!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> had leapt onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s broomstick and taken off.
Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak He called, “Come and get it, Potter!” <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
“Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” <PER>Harry</PER> ignored <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Give it here,” <PER>Harry</PER> called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!” “Oh, yeah?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and the broom shot toward <PER>Malfoy</PER> like a javelin.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> only just got out of the way in time; <PER>Harry</PER> made a sharp about- face and held the broom steady.
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> called.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward and pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom handle down — next second <PER>Harry</PER> was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — <PER>Harry</PER> stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand — a foot from the ground <PER>Harry</PER> caught it, just in time to pull <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom straight, and <PER>Harry</PER> toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> got to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s feet, trembling.
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare you — might have broken your neck — ” “It wasn’t his fault, Professor — ” “Be quiet, Miss Patil — ” “But <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ” “That’s enough, Arthur.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was sweeping along without even looking at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had to jog to keep up.
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> didn’t say a word to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
He stomach twisted as He imagined it, watching <PER>Ron</PER> and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s bag.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> opened the door and poked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s head inside.
thought <PER>Harry</PER>, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Follow me, you two,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around <PER>Harry</PER> and staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Light — speedy — we’ll have to get <PER>Harry</PER> a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “I shall speak to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just finished telling <PER>Ron</PER> what had happened when <PER>Harry</PER>’d left the grounds with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about — ” “ — a century,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shoveling pie into <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
“Wood told me.” <PER>Ron</PER> was so amazed, so impressed, <PER>Harry</PER> just sat and gaped at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Catching the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, <PER>Harry</PER> added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ignored him and spoke to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and <PER>Malfoy</PER> were saying — ” “Bet you could,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered.
All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as <PER>Harry</PER> lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (<PER>Neville</PER> wasn’t back from the hospital wing).
<PER>Ron</PER> had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If him tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mistress Norris, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> was pushing <PER>Harry</PER>'s luck, breaking another school rule today.
On the other hand, <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat <PER>Malfoy</PER> face-to-face.
“Go back to bed!” “I almost told your brother,” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped, “Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
“Come on,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> followed <PER>Ron</PER> through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found <PER>Hermione</PER> facing an empty painting.
“Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, <PER>Neville</PER>, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” “Don’t leave me!” said <PER>Neville</PER>, scrambling to <PER>Neville</PER>'s feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.” <PER>Ron</PER> looked at his watch and then glared furiously at <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>.
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies <PER>Quirrell</PER> told us about, and used it on you.” <PER>Hermione</PER> opened <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth, perhaps to tell <PER>Ron</PER> exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but <PER>Harry</PER> hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> took out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand in case <PER>Malfoy</PER> leapt in and started at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> had only just raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Horror-struck, <PER>Harry</PER> waved madly at the other three to follow <PER>Harry</PER> as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch’s voice.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s robes had barely whipped round the corner when <PER>Neville</PER>’s robes heard Filch enter the trophy room.
<PER>Neville</PER> suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run — <PER>Neville</PER> tripped, grabbed <PER>Ron</PER> around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.
“RUN!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, <PER>Harry</PER> in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found they in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
“I think we’ve lost him,” <PER>Harry</PER> panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
“I — told — you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “quickly as possible.” “<PER>Malfoy</PER> tricked you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I think well be okay — get off <PER>Neville</PER>!” For <PER>Neville</PER> had been tugging on the sleeve of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bathrobe for the last minute.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER>’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
<PER>Harry</PER> groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, <PER>Harry</PER>’d take Filch.
“If any dog needs exercise, that one does.” <PER>Hermione</PER> had got both <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bad temper back again.
“You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you?” But <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> something else to think about as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed back into bed.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> couldn’t believe his eyes when his saw that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one.
In the meantime, <PER>Harry</PER> filled <PER>Ron</PER> in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
Neither <PER>Neville</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now refusing to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, knocking <PER>Harry</PER>'s bacon to the floor.
Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> had difficulty hiding Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s glee as Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> handed the note to <PER>Ron</PER> to read.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> seized the package from <PER>Harry</PER> and felt the package.
“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to <PER>Harry</PER> with a mixture of jealousy and spite on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before <PER>Ron</PER> could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s elbow.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s obvious rage and confusion.
“Well, it’s true,” <PER>Harry</PER> chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen <PER>Neville</PER>’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “it’s doing us so much good.” <PER>Hermione</PER> marched away with her nose in the air.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a lot of trouble keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind on <PER>Harry</PER>'s lessons that day.
“Wow,” <PER>Ron</PER> sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedspread.
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, <PER>Harry</PER> mounted <PER>Harry</PER>'s broomstick and kicked off from the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.
“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, hoping <PER>Harry</PER> sounded offhand.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because <PER>Neville</PER> had been trying to catch <PER>Neville</PER>'s eye).
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, was to be working with <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
It was hard to tell whether <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> was angrier about this.
Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — <PER>Harry</PER> had to put it out with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hat.
“You’re saying it wrong,” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> snap.
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to <PER>Harry</PER> as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.” Someone knocked into <PER>Harry</PER> as they hurried past <PER>Harry</PER>.
On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that <PER>Hermione</PER> was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put <PER>Hermione</PER> out of their minds.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just helping <PER>Harry</PER> to a baked potato when Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER> came sprinting into the hall, Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>'s turban askew and terror on his face.
Everyone stared as <PER>Harry</PER> reached Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” <PER>Harry</PER> then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly grabbed <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm.
“I’ve just thought — <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “What about her?” “her doesn’t know about the troll.” <PER>Ron</PER> bit his lip.
“Percy!” hissed <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> behind a large stone griffin.
“He’s heading for the third floor,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, but <PER>Ron</PER> held up He's hand.
“Can you smell something?” <PER>Harry</PER> sniffed and a foul stench reached <PER>Harry</PER>'s nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger was about to faint.
“Confuse it!” <PER>Harry</PER> said desperately to <PER>Ron</PER>, and, seizing a tap, <PER>Harry</PER> threw it as hard as <PER>Harry</PER> could against the wall.
The troll didn’t even seem to notice a metal pipe, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward <PER>Ron</PER> instead, giving <PER>Harry</PER> time to run around it.
“Come on, run, run\” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled at <PER>Hermione</PER>, trying to pull <PER>Hermione</PER>'s toward the door, but <PER>Hermione</PER> couldn’t move, <PER>Hermione</PER> was still flat against the wall, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth open with terror.
<PER>Harry</PER> then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: <PER>Harry</PER> took a great running jump and managed to fasten <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms around the troll’s neck from behind.
The troll couldn’t feel <PER>Harry</PER> hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had still been in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand when he’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.
Howling with pain, even a troll twisted and flailed its club, with <PER>Harry</PER> clinging on for dear life; any second, even a troll was going to rip <PER>Harry</PER> off or catch <PER>Harry</PER> a terrible blow with the club.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had sunk to the floor in fright; <PER>Ron</PER> pulled out his own wand — not knowing what his was going to do his heard his cry the first spell that came into his head: “Wingardium Leviosal” The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto — owner’s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Ron</PER> was standing there with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand still raised, staring at what <PER>Harry</PER> had done.
A moment later, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had come bursting into the room, closely followed by <PER>Snape</PER>, with <PER>Quirrell</PER> bringing up the rear.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was looking at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was still standing with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand in the air.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Ron</PER> would put <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand down.
“Please, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> — they were looking for me.” “Miss Granger!” <PER>Hermione</PER> had managed to get to Granger!
“Well — in that case ” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, staring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” <PER>Hermione</PER> hung her head.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here <PER>Hermione</PER> was, pretending <PER>Hermione</PER> had, to get them out of trouble.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.” “Good of shis to get us out of trouble like that,” <PER>Ron</PER> admitted.
“Mind you, us did save she.” “she might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with she,” <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>.
On Saturday, <PER>Harry</PER> would be playing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.
Hardly anyone had seen <PER>Harry</PER> play because Wood had decided that, as anyone's secret weapon, <PER>Harry</PER> should be kept, well, secret.
But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know which was worse — people telling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’d be brilliant or people telling <PER>Harry</PER> they’d be running around underneath <PER>Harry</PER> holding a mattress.
It was really lucky that <PER>Harry</PER> now had <PER>Hermione</PER> as a friend.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all <PER>Harry</PER>'s homework without her, what with all the last- minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had saved her from the mountain troll, and <PER>Hermione</PER> was much nicer for it.
The day before <PER>Harry</PER>’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed at once that <PER>Snape</PER> was limping.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat together next to a window.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was checking <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s Charms homework for them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> would never let them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to read it through, them got the right answers anyway.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind off <PER>Harry</PER>'s nerves about tomorrow.
Getting up, he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> he was going to ask <PER>Snape</PER> if he could have it.
“Better you than me,” they said together, but <PER>Harry</PER> had an idea that <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.
<PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way down to the staffroom and knocked.
<PER>Snape</PER> was holding <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes above his knees.
“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to shut the door quietly, but — <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face was twisted with fury as <PER>Harry</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes quickly to hide <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg.
“I just wondered if I could have my book back.” <PER>Harry</PER> left, before <PER>Snape</PER> could take any more points from Gryffindor.
“Did you get it?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked as <PER>Harry</PER> joined them.
“What’s the matter?” In a low whisper, <PER>Harry</PER> told them what <PER>Harry</PER>’d seen.
“I know — <PER>Harry</PER>’s not very nice, but — <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t try and steal something <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was keeping safe.” “Honestly, <PER>Hermione</PER>, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER> was snoring loudly, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t sleep.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind — <PER>Harry</PER> needed to sleep, <PER>Harry</PER> had to, <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on <PER>Snape</PER>’s face when <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg wasn’t easy to forget.
“Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.” “Thanks, Seamus,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching Seamus pile ketchup on <PER>Harry</PER>'s sausages.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined <PER>Neville</PER>, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.
Meanwhile, in the locker room, <PER>Harry</PER> and the rest of the team were changing into <PER>Harry</PER> and the rest of the team's scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .
<PER>Harry</PER> thought Flint looked as if <PER>Harry</PER> had some troll blood in <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mount your brooms, please.” <PER>Harry</PER> clambered onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand.
“<PER>Harry</PER> hasn’t had much to do yet.” “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.” When Angelina had scored, <PER>Harry</PER> had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings.
“All right there, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> was faster than Higgs — <PER>Harry</PER> could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — <PER>Harry</PER> put on an extra spurt of speed — WHAM!
A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus Flint had blocked <PER>Harry</PER> on purpose, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s broom spun off course, <PER>Harry</PER> holding on for dear life.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — <PER>Harry</PER> had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom was completely out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s control.
No one seemed to have noticed that <PER>Harry</PER>’s broom was behaving strangely It was carrying <PER>Harry</PER> slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
“Dunno what <PER>Harry</PER> thinks <PER>Harry</PER>’s doing,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> mumbled.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s broom had given a wild jerk and <PER>Harry</PER> swung off it.
“Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” At these words, <PER>Hermione</PER> seized <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER> started looking frantically at the crowd.
“I knew it,” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, “<PER>Snape</PER> — look.” <PER>Ron</PER> grabbed the binoculars.
<PER>Snape</PER> had <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes fixed on <PER>Harry</PER> and was muttering nonstop under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath.
“What should we do?” “Leave it to me.” Before <PER>Ron</PER> could say another word, <PER>Hermione</PER> had disappeared.
<PER>Ron</PER> turned the binoculars back on <PER>Harry</PER>.
The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull <PER>Harry</PER> safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good — every time they got near <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> broom would jump higher still.
they dropped lower and circled beneath <PER>Harry</PER>, obviously hoping to catch <PER>Harry</PER> if <PER>Harry</PER> fell.
“Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered desperately.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had fought <PER>Hermione</PER>'s way across to the stand where <PER>Snape</PER> stood, and was now racing along the row behind <PER>Snape</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t even stop to say sorry as <PER>Hermione</PER> knocked Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER> headfirst into the row in front.
Up in the air, <PER>Harry</PER> was suddenly able to clamber back on to <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, you can look!” <PER>Ron</PER> said.
<PER>Neville</PER> had been sobbing into <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s jacket for the last five minutes.
<PER>Harry</PER> was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw <PER>Harry</PER> clap <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth as though <PER>Harry</PER> was about to be sick — <PER>Harry</PER> hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into — <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> was being made a cup of strong tea back in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“It was <PER>Snape</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> was explaining, “<PER>Hermione</PER> and I saw him.
“Why would <PER>Snape</PER> do somethin’ like that?” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.
“ Fluffy ?” “Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to guard the — ” “Yes?” said <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
“That’s top secret, that is.” “But <PER>Snape</PER>’s trying to steal it.” “Rubbish,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> again.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.” “So why did he just try and kill <PER>Harry</PER>?” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I don’ know why <PER>Harry</PER>’s broom acted like that, but <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn’ try an’ kill a student!
The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that the Weasley twins followed <PER>Quirrell</PER> around, bouncing off the back of <PER>Quirrell</PER>'s turban.
“I do feel so sorry,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, one Potions class, “for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home.” He was looking over at <PER>Harry</PER> as He spoke.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored <PER>Harry</PER>, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish.
Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to stay on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bucking broomstick.
So <PER>Malfoy</PER>, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting <PER>Harry</PER> about having no proper family.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and <PER>Harry</PER> had signed up at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel sorry for <PER>Harry</PER> at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d ever had.
“Hi, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, want any help?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked, sticking his head through the branches.
“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, <PER>Ron</PER>.” “Would you mind moving out of the way?” came <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s cold drawl from behind them.
<PER>Ron</PER> let go of the front of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s robes.
“He was provoked, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, sticking He's huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> was insultin’ “<PER>Malfoy</PER>'s family.” “Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER> silkily.
“I’ll get him,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinding him's teeth at <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get him — ” “I hate them both,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “<PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.” “Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.” So the three of them followed <PER>Hagrid</PER> and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.
“And that reminds me — <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and they left <PER>Hagrid</PER> looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
they had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since <PER>Hagrid</PER> had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to steal?
<PER>Hermione</PER> took out a list of subjects and titles <PER>Hermione</PER> had decided to search while <PER>Ron</PER> strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random.
Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER>’d never get one.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already agreed He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’d better not ask Madam Pince where He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> could find Flamel.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t very hopeful.
Five minutes later, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined him, shaking their heads.
Once the holidays had started, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.
<PER>Ron</PER> also started teaching <PER>Harry</PER> wizard chess.
<PER>Harry</PER> played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent <PER>Harry</PER>, and they didn’t trust <PER>Harry</PER> at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at <PER>Harry</PER>, which was confusing.
“Merry Christmas,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sleepily as <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.
It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across It was To <PER>Harry</PER>, from <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?” “I think I know who that one’s from,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
“Every year My mom makes us a sweater,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, unwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.” “That’s really nice of My mom,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.
<PER>Harry</PER> next present also contained candy — a large box of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frogs from <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m sure it is — try it on.” <PER>Harry</PER> threw the cloak around <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders and <PER>Ron</PER> gave a yell.
“Merry Christmas!” “Hey, look — <PER>Harry</PER>’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. “<PER>Harry</PER>’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up <PER>Harry</PER>’s sweater.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never in all <PER>Harry</PER>'s life had such a Christmas dinner.
Up at the High Table, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had swapped <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read Professor Flitwick.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Hagrid</PER> getting redder and redder in the face as <PER>Harry</PER> called for more wine, finally kissing Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> on the cheek, who, to <PER>Harry</PER>’s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
When <PER>Harry</PER> finally left the table, <PER>Harry</PER> was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- Your-Own-Warts kit, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s own new wizard chess set.
Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where <PER>Harry</PER> broke in <PER>Harry</PER>'s new chess set by losing spectacularly to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> suspected <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help Percy so much.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned over the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own bed and pulled the cloak out from under the cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> father’s this had been <PER>Harry</PER>'s father’s.
Excitement flooded through <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> stood there in the dark and silence.
Should <PER>Harry</PER> wake <PER>Harry</PER>?
Something held <PER>Harry</PER> back — his father’s cloak — <PER>Harry</PER> felt that this time — the first time — <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to use it alone.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart racing, and thought.
<PER>Harry</PER> lit a lamp to see <PER>Harry</PER>'s way along the rows of books.
a lamp looked as if The lamp was floating along in midair, and even though <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm supporting it, the sight gave <PER>Harry</PER> the creeps.
Maybe <PER>Harry</PER> was imagining it, maybe not, but <PER>Harry</PER> thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be.
<PER>Harry</PER> stumbled backward and knocked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s lamp, which went out at once.
Panicking, <PER>Harry</PER> heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, <PER>Harry</PER> ran for it.
<PER>Harry</PER> passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and <PER>Harry</PER> slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears.
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt the blood drain out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at <PER>Harry</PER> but see no reflection again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to clap <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from screaming.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed — for <PER>Harry</PER> had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder — but still, no one was there.
<PER>Harry</PER> was so close to the mirror now that <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose was nearly touching that of <PER>Harry</PER>'s reflection.
And slowly, <PER>Harry</PER> looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like <PER>Harry</PER>, other noses like <PER>Harry</PER>, even a little old man who looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>’s knobbly knees — <PER>Harry</PER> was looking at — <PER>Harry</PER>'s family, for the first time in — <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
The Potters smiled and waved at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> stared hungrily back at them, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands pressed flat against the glass as though <PER>Harry</PER> was hoping to fall right through it and reach them.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a powerful kind of ache inside <PER>Harry</PER>, half joy, half terrible sadness.
How long <PER>Harry</PER> stood there, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know.
The reflections did not fade and <PER>Harry</PER> looked and looked until a distant noise brought <PER>Harry</PER> back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s senses.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stay here, <PER>Harry</PER> had to find <PER>Harry</PER>'s way back to bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> tore <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes away from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.
“You look odd.” What <PER>Harry</PER> feared most was that <PER>Harry</PER> might not be able to find the mirror room again.
Just as <PER>Ron</PER> started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted the suit of armor.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped the cloak from around <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders and ran to the mirror.
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?” “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” <PER>Ron</PER> tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> stood quite still, both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats?
“Want to play chess, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“No.” “Why don’t we go down and visit <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “No you go ” “I know what you’re thinking about, <PER>Harry</PER>, that mirror.
There was nothing to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from staying here all night with <PER>Harry</PER>'s family.
Except — “So — back again, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides had turned to ice.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> must have walked straight past <PER>Harry</PER>, so desperate to get to the mirror <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t noticed <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was relieved to see that <PER>Harry</PER> was smiling.
“So,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with <PER>Harry</PER>, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “It — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend <PER>Ron</PER> himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gently.
“Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had convinced <PER>Harry</PER> not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> could forget what <PER>Harry</PER>’d seen in the mirror as easily, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t.
Over and over again <PER>Harry</PER> dreamed about <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
“You see, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> told him about these dreams.
Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that he had had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though <PER>Harry</PER> was still sure <PER>Harry</PER>’d read the name somewhere.
Quite apart from wanting to win, <PER>Harry</PER> found that <PER>Harry</PER> had fewer nightmares when <PER>Harry</PER> was tired out after training.
“ <PER>Snape</PER>’s refereeing?” <PER>Snape</PER> spluttered through a mouthful of mud.
“We’ve just got to make sure We play a clean game, so <PER>Snape</PER> hasn’t got an excuse to pick on We.” Which was all very well, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had another reason for not wanting <PER>Snape</PER> near <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER> was playing Quidditch.
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but <PER>Harry</PER> headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> playing chess.
Chess was the only thing <PER>Hermione</PER> ever lost at, something <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> thought was very good for her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said <PER>Ron</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> sat down next to <PER>Harry</PER>, “I need to concern” <PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s legs sprang apart and <PER>Neville</PER>’s got to <PER>Neville</PER>’s's feet, trembling.
“What happened?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked him, leading him over to sit with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> shakily.
“Report him!” <PER>Neville</PER> shook <PER>Neville</PER>'s head.
“You’ve got to stand up to him, <PER>Neville</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of He and make it easier.” “There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s already done that,” <PER>Neville</PER> choked out.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt in the pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and pulled out a <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog, the very last one from the box <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> for Christmas.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave it to <PER>Neville</PER>, who looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> might cry.
“You’re worth twelve of <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
Then He looked up at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in shis arms.
“I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.” “Light?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> told him to be quiet until <PER>Hermione</PER>’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
At last <PER>Hermione</PER> found what <PER>Hermione</PER> was looking for.
“The what?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“See?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had finished.
“He’s not exactly recent if He’s six hundred and sixty-five, is He?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one.
It wasn’t until <PER>Ron</PER> said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that <PER>Harry</PER> remembered about <PER>Snape</PER> and the coming match.
“I’m going to play,” he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
As the match drew nearer, however, <PER>Harry</PER> became more and more nervous, whatever <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know whether <PER>Harry</PER> was imagining it or not, but <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to keep running into <PER>Snape</PER> wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went.
At times, <PER>Harry</PER> even wondered whether <PER>Snape</PER> was following <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to catch <PER>Harry</PER> on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, <PER>Snape</PER> was so horrible to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t see how <PER>Harry</PER> could — yet <PER>Harry</PER> sometimes had the horrible feeling that <PER>Snape</PER> could read minds.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew, when they wished <PER>Harry</PER> good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again.
<PER>Harry</PER> hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to <PER>Neville</PER>, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match.
Little did <PER>Harry</PER> know that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.
They’d gotten the idea from <PER>Malfoy</PER> using it on <PER>Neville</PER>, and were ready to use it on <PER>Snape</PER> if <PER>Snape</PER> showed any sign of wanting to hurt <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” <PER>Hermione</PER> muttered as <PER>Ron</PER> slipped his wand up his sleeve.
“Even — blimey — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s come to watch!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart did a somersault.
There was simply no way that <PER>Snape</PER> would dare to try to hurt <PER>Harry</PER> if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was watching.
Perhaps that was why <PER>Snape</PER> was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that <PER>Ron</PER> noticed, too.
“I’ve never seen <PER>Snape</PER> look so mean,” <PER>Snape</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> loudly a few minutes later, as <PER>Snape</PER> awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but <PER>Ron</PER>, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell his, <PER>Neville</PER>.” “Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and that’s saying something.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m warning you, <PER>Malfoy</PER> — one more word — ” “<PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly, “<PER>Harry</PER> — !” “What?
<PER>Hermione</PER> stood up, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s crossed fingers in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth, as <PER>Harry</PER> streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
Before <PER>Malfoy</PER> knew what was happening, <PER>Ron</PER> was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground.
<PER>Neville</PER> hesitated, then clambered over the back of <PER>Neville</PER>'s seat to help.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as <PER>Harry</PER> sped straight at <PER>Snape</PER> — <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t even notice <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> rolling around under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was <PER>Neville</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle.
Up in the air, <PER>Snape</PER> turned on <PER>Snape</PER>'s broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the next second, <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled out of the dive, <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom, a foot from the ground.
As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw <PER>Snape</PER> land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then <PER>Harry</PER> felt a hand on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and looked up into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s smiling face.
“Well done,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly, so that only <PER>Harry</PER> could hear.
Jc Jc Jc <PER>Harry</PER> left the locker room alone some time later, to take Jc Jc Jc <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed.
He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in He's head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the distance, jumping up and down, <PER>Ron</PER> cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s victory faded from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind as <PER>Harry</PER> watched.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.
Gliding silently over the castle <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Snape</PER> enter the forest at a run.
The trees were so thick <PER>Snape</PER> couldn’t see where <PER>Snape</PER> had gone.
<PER>Snape</PER> flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until <PER>Snape</PER> heard voices.
<PER>Snape</PER> climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to <PER>Snape</PER>'s broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Snape</PER> wasn’t alone.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t make out the look on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, but <PER>Harry</PER> was stuttering worse than ever.
<PER>Snape</PER> interrupted <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Have you found out how to get past that beast of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s yet?” “B-b-but Severus, I — ” “You don’t want me as your enemy, <PER>Quirrell</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, taking a step toward him.
<PER>Harry</PER> steadied <PER>Harry</PER> in time to hear <PER>Snape</PER> say, “ — your little bit of hocus-pocus.
It was almost dark now, but <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Quirrell</PER>, standing quite still as though <PER>Harry</PER> was petrified.
Jc Jc Jc “<PER>Harry</PER>, where have you been?” <PER>Hermione</PER> squeaked.
“And I gave <PER>Malfoy</PER> a black eye, and <PER>Neville</PER> tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!
“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and <PER>Snape</PER>’s trying to force <PER>Quirrell</PER> to help him get it.
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
<PER>Snape</PER> was sweeping about in <PER>Snape</PER>'s usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe.
Whenever <PER>Harry</PER> passed <PER>Quirrell</PER> these days <PER>Harry</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> an encouraging sort of smile, and <PER>Ron</PER> had started telling people off for laughing at <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s stutter.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, had more on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all <PER>Hermione</PER>'s notes.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn’t have minded, but <PER>Hermione</PER> kept nagging them to do the same.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, the exams are ages away.” “Ten weeks,” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped.
Moaning and yawning, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard <PER>Ron</PER> say, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>!
“Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?” “There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” “SHHHH!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> again.
“We wondered who <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had trusted enough to help <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, apart from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s chest swelled at these last words.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> beamed at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that let’s see he borrowed Fluffy from me then some o’ the teachers did enchantments Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> — ” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER> — an’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> himself did somethin’, o’ course.
“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> anxiously.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> — what’s that?” But <PER>Harry</PER> already knew what it was.
“Ah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, fiddling nervously with his beard, “That’s — er ” “Where did you get it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had now started making study schedules for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, too.
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought <PER>Harry</PER> another note from <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?” “We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s going to be in when someone finds out what someone’s doing — ” “Shut up!” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was only a few feet away and <PER>Malfoy</PER> had stopped dead to listen.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like the look on <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face at all.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, <PER>Hermione</PER> agreed to run down to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s with the other two during morning break.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from exactly?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s face — exactly?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> leapt to exactly?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s feet and ran to the window.
Something about the smile lurking on <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face during the next week made <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> very nervous.
They spent most of They's free time in <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s.
“Set <PER>Harry</PER> free.” “I can’t,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert’s going to be as long as your house.
“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, can’t.” <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly turned to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“How about it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” And in the end, <PER>Hagrid</PER> agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.
Wednesday night found <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
<PER>Ron</PER> appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>’s Invisibility Cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been down at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, helping <PER>Harry</PER> feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find <PER>Ron</PER> in a terrible state in bed.
“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, but this didn’t soothe <PER>Ron</PER> at all.
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book <PER>Malfoy</PER> took, that book <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t get a chance to answer.
“It’s too late to change the plan now,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would have felt sorry for <PER>Hagrid</PER> when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t been so worried about what <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had to do.
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> sobbed, as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had <PER>Malfoy</PER> by the ear.
Charlie’s friends showed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the harness they’d rigged up, so Charlie’s friends could suspend Norbert between They.
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.
When Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> appeared, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was leading <PER>Neville</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Neville</PER> burst out, the moment <PER>Neville</PER> saw the other two.
“I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard <PER>Malfoy</PER> saying <PER>Malfoy</PER> was going to catch you, <PER>Malfoy</PER> said you had a drag — ” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head violently to shut <PER>Neville</PER> up, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had seen.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> towered over the three of them.
Poor, blundering <PER>Neville</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> knew what it must have cost — <PER>Harry</PER> to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.
“Fifty points each,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, breathing heavily through Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s long, pointed nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the bottom had dropped out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Neville</PER> sobbing into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillow for what seemed like hours.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Neville</PER>, like <PER>Harry</PER>, was dreading the dawn.
And then the story started to spread: <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, the famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but <PER>Harry</PER> swore to <PER>Harry</PER> not to meddle in things that weren’t <PER>Harry</PER>'s business from now on.
The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to <PER>Harry</PER> during practice, and if they had to speak about <PER>Harry</PER>, they called <PER>Harry</PER> “the Seeker.” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were suffering, too.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had stopped drawing attention to <PER>Hermione</PER> in class, keeping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head down and working in silence.
All the studying <PER>Harry</PER> had to do kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind off his misery.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept to He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.
Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, <PER>Harry</PER>’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern <PER>Harry</PER> was put to an unexpected test.
Walking back from the library on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own one afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER> heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.
As <PER>Harry</PER> drew closer, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s voice.
Next second, <PER>Quirrell</PER> came hurrying out of the classroom straightening <PER>Quirrell</PER>'s turban.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> was pale and looked as though <PER>Quirrell</PER> was about to cry.
He strode out of sight; <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t think <PER>Quirrell</PER> had even noticed <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was halfway toward it before <PER>Harry</PER> remembered what <PER>Harry</PER>’d promised <PER>Harry</PER> about not meddling.
All the same, <PER>Harry</PER>’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that <PER>Snape</PER> had just left the room, and from what <PER>Harry</PER> had just heard, <PER>Snape</PER> would be walking with a new spring in <PER>Snape</PER>'s step — <PER>Quirrell</PER> seemed to have given in at last.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back to the library, where <PER>Hermione</PER> was testing <PER>Ron</PER> on Astronomy.
<PER>Harry</PER> told them what <PER>Harry</PER>’d heard.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s done it, then!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“If <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s told him how to break him's Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Maybe <PER>Snape</PER>’s found out how to get past <PER>Snape</PER> without asking <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them.
“If us just do a bit of poking around — ” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled a map of Jupiter toward <PER>Harry</PER> and started to learn the names of its moons.
The following morning, notes were delivered to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> at the breakfast table.
Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they’d lost.
Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> half expected <PER>Hermione</PER> to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t say a word.
Like <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER> felt they deserved what they’d got.
At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to <PER>Ron</PER> in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had also forgotten that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had gotten a detention, too.
Ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> could see the lighted windows of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut.
“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard.” <PER>Neville</PER> clutched the sleeve of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robe and made a choking noise.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> now turned to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to hear the note of panic in <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
“So me, <PER>Harry</PER>, an’ <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll go one way an’ <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, an’ Fang’ll go the other.
A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> took the left path while <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Fang took the right.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> looked very worried.
“You all right, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> whispered.
“Don’ worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s jaws dropped.
“Oh, it’s you, <PER>Ron</PER>an,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> in relief.
“Good evening to you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>an.
“Were you going to shoot me?” “Can’t be too careful, <PER>Ron</PER>an,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, patting his crossbow.
“Listen, I’m glad we’ve run inter yeh, <PER>Ron</PER>an, ’cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?” <PER>Ron</PER>an didn’t answer immediately.
“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” “Yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “but have yeh seen anythin’, <PER>Ron</PER>an?
At last, <PER>Ron</PER>an said, “The forest hides many secrets.” A movement in the trees behind <PER>Ron</PER>an made <PER>Hagrid</PER> raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than <PER>Ron</PER>an.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept looking nervously over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very glad they had <PER>Hagrid</PER> and his crossbow with they.
they had just passed a bend in the path when <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s arm.
“I don’t care if <PER>Malfoy</PER> has, but if something’s got <PER>Neville</PER> it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.” The minutes dragged by.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Fang were with him.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, it seemed, had sneaked up behind <PER>Neville</PER> and grabbed <PER>Neville</PER> as a joke.
“Look — ” <PER>Harry</PER> murmured, holding out his arm to stop <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made <PER>Harry</PER> freeze where <PER>Harry</PER> stood.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and Fang stood transfixed.
It got to It feet and came swiftly toward <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — couldn’t move for fear.
The pain in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head was so bad <PER>Harry</PER> fell to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees.
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
He looked carefully at <PER>Harry</PER>, He's eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
<PER>Ron</PER>an and Bane came bursting through the trees, <PER>Ron</PER>an and Bane's flanks heaving and sweaty.
“What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?” Firenze slowed to a walk, warned <PER>Harry</PER> to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer <PER>Harry</PER>’s question.
They made They's way through the trees in silence for so long that <PER>Harry</PER> thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to <PER>Harry</PER> anymore.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, startled by the odd question.
“I’m fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, hardly knowing what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying.
“The unicorn’s dead, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, it’s in that clearing back there.” “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as <PER>Hagrid</PER> hurried off to examine the unicorn.
“You are safe now.” <PER>Harry</PER> slid off <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when <PER>Harry</PER> roughly shook <PER>Harry</PER> awake.
In a matter of seconds, though, He was wide- eyed as <PER>Harry</PER> began to tell him and <PER>Hermione</PER> what had happened in the forest.
“<PER>Snape</PER> wants the Stone for <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s waiting in the forest and all this time we thought “<PER>Snape</PER> just wanted to get rich.
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is <PER>Snape</PER> to steal the Stone,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on feverishly, “then <PER>Voldemort</PER> will be able to come and finish me off.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, everyone says <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s the only one <PER>Voldemort</PER> was ever afraid of.
When <PER>Harry</PER> pulled back <PER>Harry</PER>'s sheets, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them.
In years to come, <PER>Harry</PER> would never quite remember how <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to get through <PER>Harry</PER>'s exams when <PER>Harry</PER> half expected <PER>Voldemort</PER> to come bursting through the door at any moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> did the best <PER>Harry</PER> could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead, which had been bothering <PER>Harry</PER> ever since <PER>Harry</PER>'s trip into the forest.
<PER>Neville</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had a bad case of exam nerves because <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that <PER>Harry</PER> kept being woken by <PER>Harry</PER>'s old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as <PER>Harry</PER>.
The idea of <PER>Voldemort</PER> certainly scared them, but <PER>Voldemort</PER> didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and them were so busy with them's studying them didn’t have much time to fret about what <PER>Snape</PER> or anyone else might be up to.
“I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” <PER>Hermione</PER> always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but <PER>Ron</PER> said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.
“You could look more cheerful, <PER>Harry</PER>, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” <PER>Harry</PER> was rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, relax, <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s around.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tried to explain this, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “That’s just the exams.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> would never betray <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy never but — <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly jumped to — <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“We’ve got to go and see <PER>Hagrid</PER>, now.” “Why?” panted <PER>Hermione</PER>, hurrying to keep up.
“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what <PER>Hagrid</PER> wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket?
“We’ve got to go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either <PER>Snape</PER> or <PER>Voldemort</PER> under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got <PER>Hagrid</PER> drunk.
They had never been told where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lived, nor did They know anyone who had been sent to see <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“We want to see Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, rather bravely, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> thought.
“See Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s gone?” said <PER>Harry</PER> frantically.
“Now?” “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is a very great wizard, Potter, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has many demands on Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s time — ” “But this is important.” “Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” “Look,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Whatever Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had expected, it wasn’t that.
“It’s tonight,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, once he was sure Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was out of earshot.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> wheeled round.
“We were — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began, without any idea what <PER>Harry</PER> was going to say.
“One of us has got to keep an eye on <PER>Snape</PER> — wait outside the staffroom and follow <PER>Snape</PER> — if <PER>Snape</PER> — leaves it.
“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER>.
No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> turned up again and this time, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> lost Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s temper.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just said, “At least <PER>Hermione</PER>’s on <PER>Snape</PER>’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and <PER>Hermione</PER> came in.
“<PER>Snape</PER> came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and <PER>Snape</PER> went to get <PER>Snape</PER>, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where <PER>Snape</PER> went.” “Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“After what <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER> have said?
“You’re right, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a small voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> didn’t talk much.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out the cloak and then <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes fell on the flute <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given the flute <PER>Hagrid</PER> for Christmas.
<PER>Harry</PER> pocketed it to use on Fluffy — <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel much like singing.
<PER>Neville</PER> appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though <PER>Neville</PER>’d been making another bid for freedom.
“Nothing, <PER>Neville</PER>, nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, hurriedly putting the cloak behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
“I’ll — I’ll fight you!” “<PER>Neville</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot — ” “Don’t you call me an idiot!” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, you don’t know what you’re doing.” <PER>Neville</PER> took a step forward and <PER>Neville</PER> dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.
“I’m ready!” <PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh, <PER>Neville</PER>, I’m so sorry.” “We had to, <PER>Neville</PER>, no time to explain,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’ll understand later, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.
“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear, but <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“Brilliant, <PER>Harry</PER>!” whispered <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, there you are,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quietly, “<PER>Snape</PER>’s already got past Fluffy.” Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them.
“<PER>Snape</PER> must have left it there.” “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Keep playing,” <PER>Ron</PER> warned <PER>Harry</PER> as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor.
“Want to go first, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “No, I don’t!” “All right.” <PER>Ron</PER> gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.” <PER>Harry</PER>, who was still playing the flute, waved at <PER>Ron</PER> to get his attention and pointed at his.
<PER>Hermione</PER> landed on <PER>Harry</PER>’s other side.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had to struggle because the moment <PER>Hermione</PER> had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around <PER>Hermione</PER>'s ankles.
As for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had managed to free <PER>Hermione</PER> before the plant got a firm grip on <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried, wringing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands.
“ARE YOU A “Oh, right!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> whipped out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, waved wand, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on <PER>Snape</PER> at the plant.
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “and lucky <PER>Harry</PER> doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when <PER>Hermione</PER> tried <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Alohomora Charm.
“That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.” <PER>Ron</PER> went speeding in the direction that <PER>Harry</PER> was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
“We’ve got to close in on it!” <PER>Harry</PER> called, not taking <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes off the key with the damaged wing.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, you come at it from above — <PER>Hermione</PER>, stay below and stop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s cheers landed quickly, and <PER>Harry</PER> ran to the door, the key struggling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“Ready?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked the other two, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand on the door handle.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.
“Just tell us what to do.” “Well, <PER>Harry</PER>, you take the place of that bishop, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, you go there instead of that castle.” “What about you?” “I’m going to be a knight,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took.
Twice, <PER>Ron</PER> only just noticed in time that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were in danger.
“Yes ” said <PER>Ron</PER> softly, “it’s the only way I’ve got to be taken.” “NO!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shouted.
the white queen struck <PER>Ron</PER> hard across the head with the white queen's stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed but stayed on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s square — the white queen dragged <PER>Ron</PER> to one side.
With one last desperate look back at <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> charged through the door and up the next passageway.
“What do you reckon’s next?” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; <PER>McGonagall</PER> transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s spell, and <PER>Snape</PER>’s ” them had reached another door.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Cho</PER>ose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, us give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a great sigh and <PER>Harry</PER>, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
“I might get lucky again.” <PER>Hermione</PER>’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at <PER>Harry</PER> and threw shis arms around <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>l” “<PER>Harry</PER> — you’re a great wizard, you know.” “I’m not as good as you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.
“Here I come,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER> drained the little bottle in one gulp.
“I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.” “But I thought — <PER>Snape</PER> — ” “Severus?” <PER>Quirrell</PER> laughed, and it wasn’t <PER>Quirrell</PER>'s usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.
“I saw you and <PER>Snape</PER> in the forest — ” <PER>Snape</PER> blurted out.
“I see the Stone I’m presenting it to my master but where is it?” <PER>Harry</PER> struggled against the ropes binding <PER>Harry</PER>, but they didn’t give.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to keep <PER>Quirrell</PER> from giving <PER>Harry</PER>'s whole attention to the mirror.
“But <PER>Snape</PER> always seemed to hate me so much.” “Oh, <PER>Snape</PER> does,” said <PER>Quirrell</PER> casually, “heavens, yes.
“<PER>Snape</PER> is with me wherever I go,” said <PER>Quirrell</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> was remembering <PER>Harry</PER>'s trip to Diagon Alley — how could <PER>Harry</PER> have been so stupid?
<PER>Harry</PER>’d seen <PER>Quirrell</PER> there that very day, shaken hands with <PER>Harry</PER> in the Leaky Cauldron.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> ignored <PER>Quirrell</PER>.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> was still talking to <PER>Quirrell</PER>.
“Use the boy Use the boy ” <PER>Quirrell</PER> rounded on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> got slowly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.” <PER>Harry</PER> walked toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s turban.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.
It winked and put the Stone back in the Stone pocket — and as it did so, <PER>Harry</PER> felt something heavy drop into <PER>Harry</PER>'s real pocket.
“What do you see?” <PER>Harry</PER> screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s courage.
As <PER>Harry</PER> moved aside, <PER>Harry</PER> felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have screamed, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t make a sound.
Where there should have been a back to <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to take a step backward but <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs wouldn’t move.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> was walking backward at him, so that <PER>Voldemort</PER> could still see <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar; <PER>Harry</PER>'s head felt as though it was about to split in two; <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, struggling with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might, and to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surprise, <PER>Quirrell</PER> let go of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!” And <PER>Quirrell</PER>, though pinning <PER>Harry</PER> to the ground with <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, let go of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck and stared, bewildered, at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own palms — <PER>Harry</PER> could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but <PER>Harry</PER>, by instinct, reached up and grabbed <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s face — <PER>Quirrell</PER> rolled off him, him's face blistering, too, and then <PER>Harry</PER> knew: <PER>Quirrell</PER> couldn’t touch <PER>Harry</PER>'s bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of <PER>Quirrell</PER>, keep his in enough pain to stop his from doing a curse.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, caught <PER>Quirrell</PER> by the arm, and hung on as tight as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
<PER>Quirrell</PER> screamed and tried to throw <PER>Harry</PER> off — the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head was building — <PER>Quirrell</PER> couldn’t see — <PER>Quirrell</PER> could only hear <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s terrible shrieks and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s yells of, “KILL HIM!
The smiling face of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> swam into view above Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Good afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I’ve been thinking Sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “Call him <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.
When he had found his voice again, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent it to me?” “Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyes twinkled.
“Useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.” “And there’s something else ” “Fire away.” “<PER>Quirrell</PER> said <PER>Snape</PER> — ” “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Yes, him — <PER>Quirrell</PER> said him — <PER>Quirrell</PER> hates me because him — <PER>Quirrell</PER> hated my father.
“But five minutes only.” And she let <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in.
“<PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked ready to fling <PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arms around him again, but <PER>Harry</PER> was glad <PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Hermione</PER> held <PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Hermione</PER> in as <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was still very sore.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>, we were sure you were going to — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was so worried — ” “The whole school’s talking about it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> told them everything: <PER>Quirrell</PER>; the mirror; the Stone; and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were a very good audience; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped in all the right places, and when <PER>Harry</PER> told them what was under <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s turban, <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed out loud.
“I brought <PER>Ron</PER> round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when we met <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘<PER>Harry</PER>’s gone after <PER>Harry</PER>, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” “D’you think he meant you to do it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” “Well,” <PER>Hermione</PER> exploded, “if he did — I mean to say — that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” “No, it isn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER> thoughtfully.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s a funny man, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I can, can’t “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says you are to be allowed to go,” she said sniffily, as though in shis opinion Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t realize how risky feasts could be.
he sat down next to <PER>Harry</PER>, took one look at <PER>Harry</PER>, and burst into tears.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, he’d have found out somehow, this is <PER>Voldemort</PER> we’re talking about, he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told ’d.” “Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“An’ don’ say the name!” “VOLDEMORT!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was so shocked, <PER>Harry</PER> stopped crying.
“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer photos knew yeh didn’ have any d’yeh like it?” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t speak, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> understood.
<PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving <PER>Harry</PER> one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped into a seat between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> banging <PER>Harry</PER>'s goblet on the table.
“Second — to Miss <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” <PER>Hermione</PER> buried <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arms; <PER>Harry</PER> strongly suspected she had burst into tears.
“Third — to Mister <PER>Harry</PER> Potter ” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
themselves had tied for the House Cup — if only <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> just one more point.
only <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood up to yell and cheer as <PER>Neville</PER>, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.
<PER>Harry</PER>, still cheering, nudged <PER>Ron</PER> in the ribs and pointed at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if <PER>Harry</PER>’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on he.
<PER>Snape</PER> was shaking Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile.
<PER>Snape</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and <PER>Harry</PER> knew at once that <PER>Snape</PER> ’s feelings toward <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t changed one jot.
To their great surprise, both he and <PER>Ron</PER> passed with good marks; <PER>Hermione</PER>, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
Even <PER>Neville</PER> scraped through, Even <PER>Neville</PER>'s good Herbology mark making up for Even <PER>Neville</PER>'s abysmal Potions one.
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, <PER>Neville</PER>’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); <PER>Hagrid</PER> was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
“You must come and stay this summer,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled them as them moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.
Some of them called: “Bye, <PER>Harry</PER>!” “See you, Potter!” “Still famous,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning at him.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> passed through the gateway together.
“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!” It was <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, <PER>Ron</PER>’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at <PER>Ron</PER>.
Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER>, looking terrified at the very sight of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hung back for a last word with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh, I will,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to argue back but <PER>Harry</PER>'s words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, <PER>Dudley</PER>.
“<PER>Dudley</PER> gets enough, don’t you, son?” <PER>Dudley</PER>, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“All right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “all right ” Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching <PER>Harry</PER> closely out of the corners of <PER>Harry</PER>'s small, sharp eyes.
Ever since <PER>Harry</PER> had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating Uncle Vernon like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because <PER>Harry</PER> Potter wasn’t a normal boy.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
<PER>Harry</PER> missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, <PER>Harry</PER>'s classes (though perhaps not <PER>Snape</PER>, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).
All <PER>Harry</PER>’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant <PER>Harry</PER> had come home.
What did the Dursleys care if <PER>Harry</PER> lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s place on the House Quidditch team because <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t practiced all summer?
What was it to the Dursleys if <PER>Harry</PER> went back to school without any of <PER>Harry</PER>'s homework done?
<PER>Harry</PER> wore round glasses, and on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.
This scar was the only hint of <PER>Harry</PER>’s very mysterious past, of the reason <PER>Harry</PER> had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, <PER>Harry</PER> had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s parents had died in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s attack, but <PER>Harry</PER> had escaped with <PER>Harry</PER>'s lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood why — <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill <PER>Harry</PER>.
So <PER>Harry</PER> had been brought up by <PER>Harry</PER>'s dead mother’s sister and her husband.
<PER>Harry</PER> had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why <PER>Harry</PER> kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys’ story that <PER>Harry</PER> had got <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar in the car crash that had killed <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents.
<PER>Harry</PER> had taken up <PER>Harry</PER>'s place at wizard school, where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar were famous but now the school year was over, and <PER>Harry</PER> was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s toast.
“And, <PER>Dudley</PER>, you 11 say — ” “May I take you through to the dining room, Mistress Mason?” said <PER>Dudley</PER>, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.
“And you, boy?” <PER>Harry</PER> fought to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s face straight as <PER>Harry</PER> emerged.
More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, <PER>Harry</PER> missed <PER>Harry</PER>'s best friends, <PER>Ron</PER> Weasley and <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
Neither of They had written to him all summer, even though <PER>Ron</PER> had said him was going to ask <PER>Harry</PER> to come and stay.
Countless times, <PER>Harry</PER> had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> with a letter, but it wasn’t worth the risk.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t told the Dursleys this; <PER>Harry</PER> knew it was only their terror that <PER>Harry</PER> might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking <PER>Harry</PER> in the cupboard under the stairs with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and broomstick.
For the first couple of weeks back, <PER>Harry</PER> had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath and watching <PER>Dudley</PER> tearing out of the room as fast as <PER>Harry</PER>'s fat legs would carry <PER>Harry</PER>.
But the long silence from <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had made <PER>Harry</PER> feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting <PER>Dudley</PER> had lost its appeal — and now <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had forgotten his birthday.
He’d almost be glad of a sight of He's archenemy, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream.
At the very end of last term, <PER>Harry</PER> had come face-to-face with none other than Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> might be a ruin of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s former self, but <PER>Voldemort</PER> was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power.
<PER>Harry</PER> had slipped through <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, <PER>Harry</PER> kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was now, remembering <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s livid face, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wide, mad eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, not taking <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes off the spot where they had been.
While <PER>Dudley</PER> lolled around watching and eating ice cream, <PER>Harry</PER> cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> shouldn’t have risen to <PER>Dudley</PER>’s bait, but <PER>Dudley</PER> had said the very thing <PER>Harry</PER> had been thinking <PER>Harry</PER> maybe <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have any friends at Hogwarts.
Wish they could see famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter now, famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thought savagely as famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter spread manure on the flower beds, famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's back aching, sweat running down famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's face.
<PER>Harry</PER> washed <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and bolted down <PER>Harry</PER>'s pitiful supper.
“Remember, boy — one sound — ” <PER>Harry</PER> crossed to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew instantly that this was what had been watching <PER>Harry</PER> out of the garden hedge that morning.
As they stared at each other, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Dudley</PER>’s voice from the hall.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched voice <PER>Harry</PER> was sure would carry down the stairs.
“Never never ever ” <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard the voices downstairs falter.
“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to cheer <PER>Harry</PER> up.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby reverently, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's orb-like eyes aglow.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named — ” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Dobby clapped <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands over <PER>Harry</PER>'s bat ears and moaned, “Ah, speak not the name, sir!
“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter met <PER>Voldemort</PER> for a second time, just weeks ago that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter escaped yet again.” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.
“Ah, sir,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, dabbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter must stay where <PER>Harry</PER> Potter is safe.
“All right!” cried <PER>Harry</PER>, grabbing the elf’s arm to stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Not — not <PER>Voldemort</PER>, sir — ” But Dobby’s eyes were wide and Dobby seemed to be trying to give <PER>Harry</PER> a hint.
“<PER>Harry</PER> hasn’t got a brother, has <PER>Harry</PER>?” Dobby shook Dobby's head, his eyes wider than ever.
“I mean, there’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, for one thing — you know who ’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is, don’t you?” Dobby bowed Dobby's head.
Two seconds later <PER>Harry</PER>, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, “<PER>Dudley</PER> must have left “<PER>Dudley</PER>'s television on again, the little tyke!” “Quick!
Stepping nimbly out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s reach, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase <PER>Harry</PER> Potter was wearing.
<PER>Harry</PER> could make out <PER>Hermione</PER>’s neat writing, <PER>Ron</PER>’s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Mouth dry, stomach lurching, <PER>Harry</PER> sprang after <PER>Harry</PER>, trying not to make a sound.
She’s been dying to hear ” <PER>Harry</PER> ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach disappear.
Yours sincerely, Mafalda Hopkirk IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE Ministry of Magic <PER>Harry</PER> looked up from the letter and gulped.
Otherwise, <PER>Harry</PER> was locked in <PER>Harry</PER>'s room around the clock.
Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see any way out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s situation.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Dobby might have saved <PER>Harry</PER> from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, <PER>Harry</PER>’d probably starve to death anyway.
<PER>Harry</PER> put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than <PER>Harry</PER> had been before the soup.
Supposing <PER>Harry</PER> was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen if <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t turn up at Hogwarts?
<PER>Harry</PER> dreamed that <PER>Harry</PER> was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to <PER>Harry</PER>'s cage.
“Stop it,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered as the rattling pounded in <PER>Harry</PER>'s sore head.
<PER>Ron</PER> Weasley was outside <PER>Harry</PER>’s window.
3 “<PER>Ron</PER>\” breathed <PER>Harry</PER>, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, how did you — What the — ?” <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what <PER>Harry</PER> was seeing hit <PER>Harry</PER>.
Grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> from the front seats were Fred and George, <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder twin brothers.
“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred reversed as close as possible to <PER>Harry</PER>’s window.
“Out of the way, <PER>Harry</PER>.” Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into <PER>Harry</PER>’s room.
You had to hand it to them, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, as George took an ordinary hairpin from <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and started to pick the lock.
<PER>Harry</PER> dashed around <PER>Harry</PER>'s room, collecting <PER>Harry</PER>'s things and passing them out of the window to <PER>Ron</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> went to help Fred and George heave <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk up the stairs.
Fred climbed back into the car to pull with <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> and George pushed from the bedroom side.
“One good push — ” <PER>Harry</PER> and George threw <PER>Harry</PER> and George's shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car.
But as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind <PER>Harry</PER>, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon’s voice.
“THAT RUDDY OWL!” “I’ve forgotten Hedwig!” <PER>Harry</PER> tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on — <PER>Harry</PER> snatched up Hedwig’s cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to <PER>Ron</PER>.
For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then Uncle Vernon let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at <PER>Harry</PER>, grabbing <PER>Harry</PER> by the ankle.
<PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms and pulled as hard as they could.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe it — <PER>Harry</PER> was free.
— <PER>Harry</PER> rolled down the window, the night air whipping — <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive.
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and <PER>Dudley</PER> were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s window.
“So — what’s the story, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently.
“What’s been happening?” <PER>Harry</PER> told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d given <PER>Harry</PER> and the fiasco of the violet pudding.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> explained.
“He hates me.” “<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said George, turning around.
“Not Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s son?” “Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He was a big supporter of <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” “And when <PER>Voldemort</PER> disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, “Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> came back saying <PER>Voldemort</PER>’d never meant any of it.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> made <PER>Dudley</PER> Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
Judging by the fact that <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> usually had the best of everything, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s family was rolling in wizard gold; <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> could just see <PER>Malfoy</PER> strutting around a large manor house.
Sending the family servant to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing <PER>Malfoy</PER> would do.
they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked out for the first time at <PER>Ron</PER>’s house.
It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which, <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>, it probably was).
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, I sleep at the — at the top — ” <PER>Ron</PER> had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house.
“Come in and have some breakfast.” She turned and walked back into the house and <PER>Harry</PER>, after a nervous glance at <PER>Ron</PER>, who nodded encouragingly, followed She.
There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and <PER>Harry</PER> sat down on the edge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat, looking around.
Every now and then Molly muttered things like “don’t know what you were thinking of,” and “never would have believed it.” “I don’t blame you, dear,” Molly assured <PER>Harry</PER>, tipping eight or nine sausages onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s plate.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in an undertone to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You didn’t ask them to fly that wretched car — ” But <PER>Harry</PER>, who felt wide awake, said quickly, “I’ll help <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> as they crossed the lawn.
Seeing the shocked look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, <PER>Ron</PER> added, “It doesn’t hurt them — you’ve just got to make them really dizzy so them can’t find them's way back to the gnomeholes.” He let go of the gnome’s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.
<PER>Harry</PER> decided just to drop the first one <PER>Harry</PER> caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into <PER>Harry</PER>’s finger and <PER>Harry</PER> had a hard job shaking it off — until — “Wow, <PER>Harry</PER> — that must’ve been fifty feet.
“<PER>Harry</PER> who?” He looked around, saw <PER>Harry</PER>, and jumped.
<PER>Harry</PER> just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at <PER>Harry</PER> before it closed with a snap.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stepped in, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Ron</PER> had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically.
<PER>Harry</PER> got a shock the first time <PER>Harry</PER> looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, “ Tuck your shirt in, scruff yV’ The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George’s bedroom were considered perfectly normal.
“Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.” <PER>Harry</PER> heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after <PER>Harry</PER> had arrived at the Burrow.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> went down to breakfast to find Mister and Mistress Weasley and <PER>Ginny</PER> already sitting at the kitchen table.
The moment she saw <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER> accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter.
<PER>Ginny</PER> seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever <PER>Harry</PER> entered a room.
<PER>Ginny</PER> dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with <PER>Ginny</PER>'s face glowing like the setting sun.
Pretending <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t noticed this, <PER>Harry</PER> sat down and took the toast Molly offered <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Letters from school,” said Arthur, passing <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> already knows you’re here, <PER>Harry</PER> — doesn’t miss a trick, that man.
“I expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s things secondhand.” “Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Fortunately no one saw this except <PER>Harry</PER>, because just then <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder brother Percy walked in.
just then <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder brother Percy was already dressed, just then <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder brother Percy's Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to just then <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder brother Percy's sweater vest.
“Lovely day.” He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath He a molting, gray feather duster — at least, that was what <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was, until <PER>Harry</PER> saw that it was breathing.
“What ’re you all up to today?” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned.
they took turns riding <PER>Harry</PER>’s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; <PER>Ron</PER>’s old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.
<PER>Harry</PER> had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; <PER>Harry</PER> stayed shut in <PER>Harry</PER>'s room the rest of the time.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s not <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared at them all watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, watch us first.” <PER>Harry</PER> took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.
<PER>Harry</PER> took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash.
Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before <PER>Harry</PER>’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass — and one of two people was the very last person <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to meet when <PER>Harry</PER> was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left; <PER>Harry</PER> shot inside a large black cabinet and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through.
Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, “Touch nothing, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.” <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I thought you were going to buy me a present.” “I said I would buy you a racing broom,” said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter.
everyone thinks he’s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick — ” “You have told me this at least a dozen times already,” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, with a quelling look at Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s son.
“And I would remind you that it is not — prudent — to appear less than fond of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made <PER>Voldemort</PER> disappear — ah, Mister Borgin.” A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing A stooping man's greasy hair back from A stooping man's face.
“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mister Borgin, abandoning Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s list and scurrying over to <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“The teachers all have favorites, that <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger — ” “I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Ha!” said <PER>Harry</PER> under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, pleased to see <PER>Malfoy</PER> looking both abashed and angry.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched nervously as <PER>Malfoy</PER> drew nearer and nearer to <PER>Harry</PER>'s hiding place, examining the objects for sale.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> walked forward — <PER>Malfoy</PER> stretched out <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hand for the handle — “Done,” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> at the counter.
“Come, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> wiped <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead on his sleeve as <PER>Malfoy</PER> turned away.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited for a minute in case <PER>Harry</PER> came back, then, quietly as <PER>Harry</PER> could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.
Clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s broken glasses to his face, <PER>Harry</PER> stared around.
Feeling jumpy, <PER>Harry</PER> set off, trying to hold <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses on straight and hoping against hope <PER>Harry</PER>’d be able to find a way out of here.
<PER>Harry</PER> supposed <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t spoken clearly enough through <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys’ fire.
“Not lost are you, my dear?” said a voice in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear, making <PER>Harry</PER> jump.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> croaked in relief.
“I was lost — Floo powder — ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER> by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands.
“Yer a mess!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> gruffly, brushing soot off <PER>Harry</PER> so forcefully he nearly knocked he into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary.
“Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno — dodgy place, <PER>Harry</PER> — don’ want no one ter see yeh down there — ” “I realized that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ducking as <PER>Hagrid</PER> made to brush him off again.
“How come yeh never wrote back ter me?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s enormous boots).
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, George, Percy, and Arthur.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> — oh, my dear — you could have been anywhere — ” Gasping for breath <PER>Ginny</PER> pulled a large clothes brush out of <PER>Ginny</PER>'s bag and began sweeping off the soot <PER>Hagrid</PER> hadn’t managed to beat away.
“Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they climbed the Gringotts steps.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> and his father.” “Did Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> buy anything?” said Arthur sharply behind them.
“Meet you back here,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER> as the Weasleys and <PER>Harry</PER> were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.
<PER>Harry</PER> enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys’ vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than <PER>Harry</PER> had in Knock- turn Alley, when it was opened.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt even worse when they reached <PER>Harry</PER>'s vault.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to block the contents from view as <PER>Harry</PER> hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> strolled off along the winding, cobbled street.
The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in <PER>Harry</PER>’s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so <PER>Harry</PER> bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows.
<PER>Ron</PER> gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until <PER>Hermione</PER> dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door.
him saw <PER>Ron</PER> — and then him saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then him leapt to him's feet and positively shouted, “It can’t be <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm, and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> to the front.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s face burned as Lockhart shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys.
“Together, you and I are worth the front page.” When he finally let go of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
“He had no idea,” Lockhart continued, giving <PER>Harry</PER> a little shake that made <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses slip to the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose, “that <PER>Harry</PER> would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me.
Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where <PER>Ginny</PER> was standing next to <PER>Ginny</PER>'s new cauldron.
<PER>Harry</PER> straightened up and found <PER>Harry</PER> face-to-face with <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was wearing his usual sneer.
“Famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.” “Leave him <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want all that!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
It was the first time <PER>Ginny</PER> had spoken in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> went scarlet as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books.
“Oh, it’s you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking at <PER>Malfoy</PER> as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe.
“Bet you’re surprised to see <PER>Harry</PER> here, eh?” “Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,” retorted <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.” <PER>Ron</PER> went as red as <PER>Ginny</PER>.
He dropped He's books into the cauldron, too, and started toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket.
“Dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?” Arthur flushed darker than either <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“The company you keep, Weasley and I thought your family could sink no lower — ” There was a thud of metal as <PER>Ginny</PER>’s cauldron went flying; Arthur had thrown Arthur at Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, knocking Arthur backward into a bookshelf.
“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your father can give you — ” Pulling himself out of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s grip himself beckoned to <PER>Malfoy</PER> and swept from the shop.
“Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that — no <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s worth listenin’ ter — bad blood, that’s what it is — come on now — let’s get outta here.” The assistant looked as though The assistant wanted to stop them from leaving, but The assistant barely came up to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s waist and seemed to think better of it.
<PER>Harry</PER> took off <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and put them safely in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket before helping himself to Floo powder.
“Not a word to Molly,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> opened the trunk and showed <PER>Harry</PER> how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily.
When at last they were all in the car, Molly glanced into the back seat, where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, “Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don’t them?” Molly and <PER>Ginny</PER> got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench.
they had almost reached the highway when <PER>Ginny</PER> shrieked that <PER>Ginny</PER>’d left <PER>Ginny</PER>'s diary.
“I’ll take <PER>Ginny</PER> and you two come right after us,” Mistress Weasley told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, grabbing <PER>Ginny</PER>’s hand and setting off.
“Let’s go together, we’ve only got a minute,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> made sure that Hedwig’s cage was safely wedged on top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and wheeled <PER>Harry</PER>'s trolley around to face the barrier.
Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; <PER>Ron</PER>’s trunk fell off with a loud thump, <PER>Harry</PER> was knocked off <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, and Hedwig’s cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and Hedwig rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think you’re doing?” “Lost control of the trolley,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs as <PER>Harry</PER> got up.
“Why can’t we get through?” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I don’t understand why the gateway’s sealed the gateway’s — ” <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
“We’re attracting too much atten — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his eyes gleaming.
<PER>Harry</PER> stuck <PER>Harry</PER>'s head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel the seat vibrating beneath <PER>Harry</PER>, hear the engine, feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses on <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose, but for all <PER>Harry</PER> could see, <PER>Harry</PER> had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.
Then there was a popping noise and the car, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> reappeared.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> had pulled off He and <PER>Ron</PER>'s sweaters, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s T-shirt was sticking to the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat and <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses kept sliding down to the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweaty nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged nervous glances.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest.
“Not far,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, more to the car than to <PER>Harry</PER>, “not far now,” and <PER>Harry</PER> patted the dashboard nervously.
“There!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, making <PER>Ron</PER> and Hedwig jump.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> gripping the edges of <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat very hard as they flew toward the lake.
Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golf-ball-sized lump was throbbing on <PER>Harry</PER>’s head where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, <PER>Ron</PER> let out a low, despairing groan.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to say <PER>Harry</PER> was sure they’d be able to mend it up at the school, but <PER>Harry</PER> never even got started.
At that very moment, something hit <PER>Harry</PER>'s side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into <PER>Ron</PER>, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof.
“What’s happen — ?” <PER>Ron</PER> gasped, staring through the windshield, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it.
“Aaargh!” said <PER>Ron</PER> as another twisted limb punched a large dent into <PER>Ron</PER> as another twisted limb's door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving — “Run for it!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, throwing his full weight against his , but next second his had been knocked backward into <PER>Harry</PER>’s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch.
With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat tip sideways: Next thing <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was sprawled on the damp ground.
“Hey — <PER>Harry</PER> — come and look — it’s the Sorting!” <PER>Harry</PER> hurried over and, together, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> peered in at the Great Hall.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was among them, easily visible because of <PER>Ginny</PER>'s vivid Weasley hair.
<PER>Harry</PER> well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for it decision as it muttered aloud in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear.
For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the rest of the Weasleys.
Last term, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes wandered past A very small, mousy-haired boy to where Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight.
“Hang on ” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> also happened to be <PER>Snape</PER> ’s least favorite student.
Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from <PER>Harry</PER>'s own House (Slytherin), <PER>Snape</PER> taught Potions.
“Maybe he’s left,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because <PER>Harry</PER> missed out on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again).” “Or <PER>Harry</PER> might have been sacked).” said <PER>Ron</PER> enthusiastically.
“I mean, everyone hates <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them, “he’s waiting to hear why you two didn’t arrive on the school train.” <PER>Harry</PER> spun around.
There, <PER>Harry</PER>'s black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was smiling in a way that told <PER>Harry</PER> He and <PER>Ron</PER> were in very deep trouble.
Not daring even to look at each other, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed <PER>Snape</PER> up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches.
<PER>Snape</PER> closed the door and turned to look at <PER>Snape</PER>.
This wasn’t the first time <PER>Snape</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> the impression of being able to read minds.
“Dear, dear his own son ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree’s larger branches.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind <PER>Snape</PER> ’s desk.
If <PER>Snape</PER> had gone to fetch Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, head of Gryffindor House, <PER>Snape</PER> had gone to fetch Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, head of Gryffindor House were hardly any better off.
Ten minutes later, <PER>Snape</PER> returned, and sure enough it was Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> who accompanied <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had seen Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> angry on several occasions, but either <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten just how thin Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s mouth could go, or <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s this angry before.
She raised Shis wand the moment She entered; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both flinched, but She merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted.
“I — I didn’t think — ” “That,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “is obvious.” There was a knock on the office door and <PER>Snape</PER>, now looking happier than ever, opened it.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared down <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s very crooked nose at them, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly found <PER>Harry</PER> wishing <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow.
Then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “Please explain why you did this.” It would have been better if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had shouted.
<PER>Harry</PER> hated the disappointment in <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
For some reason, <PER>Harry</PER> was unable to look <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in the eyes, and spoke instead to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees.
<PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> everything except that Arthur owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> knew <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would see through this at once, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked no questions about the car.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, <PER>Harry</PER> merely continued to peer at them through <PER>Harry</PER>'s spectacles.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked quickly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He cleared He's throat and said, “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree — surely acts of this nature — ” “It will be for Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> to decide on these boys’ punishments, Severus,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
“And speaking of Gryffindor — ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said sharply, but <PER>Harry</PER> cut in: “Professor, when we took the car, term hadn’t started, so — so Gryffindor shouldn’t really have points taken from it — should it?” he finished, watching her anxiously.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well they’d just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn’t squashed <PER>Harry</PER> flat.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> raised Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wand again and pointed it at <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk.
“You’re not telling me you did fly here?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding almost as severe as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Skip the lecture,” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently, “and tell us the new password.” “It’s ‘wattlebird,’ ” said <PER>Hermione</PER> impatiently, “but that’s not the point — ” Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping.
Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> inside, leaving <PER>Hermione</PER> to scramble in after them.
<PER>Harry</PER> nudged <PER>Ron</PER> in the ribs and nodded in Percy’s direction.
“ ’Night,” <PER>Harry</PER> called back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy’s.
<PER>Ron</PER> grinned guiltily at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down at the Gryffindor table next to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug.
<PER>Neville</PER> was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone <PER>Harry</PER> had ever met.
“Mail’s due any minute — I think Gran’s sending a few things I forgot.” <PER>Harry</PER> had only just started <PER>Harry</PER>'s porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd.
A big, lumpy package bounced off <PER>Neville</PER>’s head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into <PER>Hermione</PER>’s jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers.
“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, prodding Errol gently with the tip of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s finger.
It looked quite ordinary to <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode.
“You’d better open it, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> in a timid whisper.
<PER>Neville</PER> stuffed <PER>Neville</PER>'s fingers in his ears.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of <PER>Ron</PER>’s head.
“Well, I don’t know what you expected, <PER>Ron</PER>, but you “Don’t tell me I deserved it,” snapped <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s porridge away.
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had only just joined them when <PER>Hermione</PER> came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart.
<PER>Harry</PER> was about to follow <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> inside when Lockhart’s hand shot out.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lockhart, <PER>Harry</PER>'s large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.” Completely nonplussed, <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing.
“I know, I know — it’s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have — but it’s a start, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s a start” He gave <PER>Harry</PER> a hearty wink and strode off.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering <PER>Harry</PER> was supposed to be in the greenhouse, <PER>Harry</PER> opened the door and slid inside.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had taken <PER>Harry</PER>'s place between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, she said, “We’ll be repotting Mandrakes today.
“Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding as usual as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had swallowed the textbook.
They looked quite unremarkable to <PER>Harry</PER>, who didn’t have the slightest idea what <PER>Hermione</PER> meant by the “cry” of the Mandrake.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy <PER>Harry</PER> knew by sight but had never spoken to.
Everything <PER>Harry</PER> had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head during the summer.
<PER>Harry</PER> was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all <PER>Harry</PER> managed to do was give <PER>Harry</PER>'s beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“ ‘It’s your own fault your wand got snapped — ’ ” They went down to lunch, where <PER>Ron</PER>’s mood was not improved by <PER>Hermione</PER>’s showing They the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in T ransfiguration .
“Why,” demanded <PER>Ron</PER>, seizing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s schedule, “have you outlined all Lockhart’s lessons in little hearts?” <PER>Hermione</PER> snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on a stone step and buried <PER>Hermione</PER>'s nose in Voyages with Vampires again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that he was being closely watched.
he was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment <PER>Harry</PER> looked at he, <PER>Harry</PER> went bright red.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s giving out signed photos!” “No, I’m not,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, <PER>Harry</PER>'s fists clenching.
“Eat slugs, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
“It’d be worth more than his family’s whole house — ” <PER>Ron</PER> whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but <PER>Hermione</PER> shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, “Look out!” “What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, Gilderoy Lockhart's turquoise robes swirling behind Gilderoy Lockhart.
“Who’s giving out signed photos?” <PER>Harry</PER> started to speak but <PER>Harry</PER> was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders and thundered jovially, “Shouldn’t have asked!
<PER>Harry</PER> yanked <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where <PER>Harry</PER> busied <PER>Harry</PER> with piling all seven of Lockhart’s books in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, so that <PER>Harry</PER> could avoid looking at the real thing.
The rest of the class came clattering in, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’d better hope Creevey doesn’t meet <PER>Ginny</PER>, or they’ll be starting a <PER>Harry</PER> Potter fan club.” “Shut up,” snapped <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned <PER>Hermione</PER>'s name. "
<PER>Neville</PER> was cowering in <PER>Neville</PER>'s front row seat.
Two of The pixies seized <PER>Neville</PER> by the ears and lifted <PER>Neville</PER> into the air.
In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were almost at the door, and said, “Well, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into them's cage.” Lockhart swept past them and shut the door quickly behind Lockhart.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing “Rubbish,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
7 <PER>Harry</PER> spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever <PER>Harry</PER> saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor.
Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, “All right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” six or seven times a day and hear, “Hello, Colin,” back, however exasperated <PER>Harry</PER> sounded when <PER>Harry</PER> said it.
Hedwig was still angry with <PER>Harry</PER> about the disasterous car journey and <PER>Ron</PER>’s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were planning to visit <PER>Hagrid</PER> on Saturday morning.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than <PER>Harry</PER> would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
“None of the other teams have started training yet; we’re going to be first off the mark this year — ” Yawning and shivering slightly, <PER>Harry</PER> climbed out of bed and tried to find <PER>Harry</PER>'s Quidditch robes.
“Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.” When he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, <PER>Harry</PER> scribbled a note to <PER>Ron</PER> explaining where he’d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder.
“It’ll be really boring,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly, but Colin ignored <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face shining with excitement.
“So,” said Wood, at long last, jerking <PER>Harry</PER> from a wistful fantasy about what <PER>Harry</PER> could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle.
As <PER>Harry</PER> walked onto the field, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sitting in the stands.
“Haven’t even started,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had brought out of the Great Hall.
“No idea,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took <PER>Harry</PER> as far away as possible from Colin.
It was <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Aren’t you Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s son?” said Fred, looking at <PER>Malfoy</PER> with dislike.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was smirking so broadly <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s cold eyes were reduced to slits.
“A field invasion.” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were crossing the grass to see what was going on.
“What’s happening?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew at once that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at <PER>Harry</PER>'s words.
Flint had to dive in front of <PER>Malfoy</PER> to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How dare you\”, and <PER>Ron</PER> plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one, <PER>Malfoy</PER>!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm at <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was on all fours, banging the ground with <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s fist.
“We’d better get him to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, it’s nearest,” said <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled <PER>Ron</PER> up by the arms.
“Can you hold his still, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Get out of the way, Colin!” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> supported <PER>Ron</PER> out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest.
“Nearly there, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> as the gamekeeper’s cabin came into view.
“You’ll be all right in a minute — almost there — ” They were within twenty feet of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house when the front door opened, but it wasn’t <PER>Hagrid</PER> who emerged.
“Quick, behind here,” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed, dragging <PER>Ron</PER> behind a nearby bush.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled <PER>Ron</PER> out of the bush and up to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s front door.
“Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me — come in, come in — thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again — ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> supported <PER>Ron</PER> over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t seem perturbed by <PER>Ron</PER>’s slug problem, which <PER>Harry</PER> hastily explained as he lowered <PER>Ron</PER> into a chair.
“Get ’em all up, <PER>Ron</PER>.” “I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it to stop,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously, watching <PER>Ron</PER> bend over the basin.
“What did Lockhart want with you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, scratching Fang’s ears.
“Who was he tryin’ ter curse?” “<PER>Malfoy</PER> called <PER>Hermione</PER> something — it must’ve been really bad, because everyone went wild.” “It was bad,” said <PER>Ron</PER> hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> called her ‘Mudblood,’ <PER>Hagrid</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER> dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance.
“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.
“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting <PER>Harry</PER> genially on the back and sending <PER>Harry</PER> face first into the table.
“Better not risk it.” “Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> finished the last of their tea.
In the small vegetable patch behind <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen.
“Well, I’ve bin givin’ they — you know — a bit o’ help <PER>Harry</PER> noticed <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin.
“Well, you’ve done a good job on them.” “That’s what yer little sister said,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, nodding at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Met her jus’ yesterday.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Harry</PER>, his beard twitching.
“Watch it!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> roared, pulling <PER>Ron</PER> away from his precious pumpkins.
It was nearly lunchtime and as <PER>Harry</PER> had only had one bit of treacle toffee since dawn, <PER>Harry</PER> was keen to go back to school to eat.
They said good-bye to <PER>Hagrid</PER> and walked back up to the castle, <PER>Ron</PER> hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t enjoy <PER>Harry</PER>'s shepherd’s pie as much as he’d thought.
<PER>Harry</PER> let Lockhart’s voice wash over Lockhart’s, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and “Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then Lockhart’s caught a phrase like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, <PER>Harry</PER>,” or “Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.” The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved <PER>Harry</PER>'s aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley’s address.
<PER>Harry</PER> was straining <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> mustn’t expect a treat like this every time <PER>Harry</PER> got detention.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas, got into bed, and waited.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> frowning in the moonlight.
As <PER>Harry</PER> squelched along the deserted corridor <PER>Harry</PER> came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as <PER>Harry</PER> was.
“Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly — ” The rest of <PER>Harry</PER>’s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near <PER>Harry</PER>'s ankles.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t much like Peeves, but couldn’t help feeling grateful for <PER>Harry</PER>'s timing.
With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn’t on his way back, <PER>Harry</PER> picked up the envelope and read: KWIKSPELL A Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic Intrigued, <PER>Harry</PER> flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just reading “Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)” when shuffling footsteps outside told <PER>Harry</PER> Filch was coming back.
“We’ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet — ” His eyes fell on <PER>Harry</PER> and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, <PER>Harry</PER> realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.
<PER>Harry</PER> braced <PER>Harry</PER> for a tidal wave of fury.
“If I thought you’d read my private — not that it’s mine — for a friend — be that as it may — however — <PER>Harry</PER> was staring at — <PER>Harry</PER>, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — would I be asking too much — but no, you wouldn’t want — ” “What is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Oh,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, not sure whether <PER>Harry</PER> should look sorry or happy about this.
“A deathday party?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> keenly when <PER>Harry</PER> had changed at last and joined <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER> in the common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> was at the point of telling <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room.
The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.
“A promise is a promise,” <PER>Hermione</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER> bossily.
“You said you’d go to the deathday party.” So at seven o’clock, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.
As <PER>Harry</PER> shivered and drew <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.
“Shall we have a look around?” <PER>Harry</PER> suggested, wanting to warm up <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON DIED 3 1 ST OCTOBER, 1 492 <PER>Harry</PER> watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth held wide so that <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth passed through one of the stinking salmon.
“I expect they’ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> knowledgeably, pinching <PER>Hermione</PER>'s nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.
“No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s looking?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, nudging <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> painfully in the ribs.
“Live ’uns!” said Sir Patrick, spotting <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter).
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’re you — ?” “It’s that voice again — shut up a minute — ” soo hungry for so long ” “Listen!” said <PER>Harry</PER> urgently, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> froze, watching him.
A mixture of fear and excitement gripped <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward?
<PER>Harry</PER> sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> clattering behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’re we — ” “SHH!” <PER>Harry</PER> strained <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what was that all about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, wiping sweat off his face.
As they edged nearer, <PER>Harry</PER> almost slipped — there was a large puddle of water on the floor; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “Let’s get out of here.” “Shouldn’t we try and help — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began awkwardly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight.
In seconds, he had swept past <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and detached Mistress Norris from the torch bracket.
Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; so did Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was bent almost as close, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyes narrowed.
<PER>Snape</PER> loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though <PER>Snape</PER> was trying hard not to smile.
Much as he detested Filch, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help feeling a bit sorry for <PER>Harry</PER>, though not nearly as sorry as <PER>Harry</PER> felt for <PER>Harry</PER>.
If <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believed Filch, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would be expelled for sure.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was now muttering strange words under <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s breath and tapping Mistress Norris with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand but nothing happened: Mistress Norris continued to look as though Mistress Norris had been recently stuffed. "
“It would take Dark Magic of the most advanced — ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did it, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did it!” Filch spat, He's pouchy face purpling.
“I never touched Mistress Norris!” <PER>Harry</PER> said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, including all the Lockharts on the walls.
“He saw my Kwikspell letter!” “If I might speak, Headmaster,” said <PER>Snape</PER> from the shadows, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s sense of foreboding increased; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure nothing <PER>Snape</PER> had to say was going to do <PER>Harry</PER> any good.
“Why go up to that corridor?” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You may go,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> squinted at <PER>Harry</PER>'s friends’ darkened faces.
“Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.” Something in <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice made <PER>Harry</PER> ask, “You do believe me, don’t you?” “ ’Course I do,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quickly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER> scrubbing the message on the wall with Mistress Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone.
“Stuff like this doesn’t often happen at Hogwarts,” <PER>Ron</PER> assured <PER>Ginny</PER>.
It was quite usual for <PER>Hermione</PER> to spend a lot of time reading, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was now doing almost nothing else.
Nor could <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> get much response from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s when they asked what <PER>Hermione</PER> was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been held back in Potions, where <PER>Snape</PER> had made <PER>Harry</PER> stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks.
After a hurried lunch, <PER>Harry</PER> went upstairs to meet <PER>Ron</PER> in the library, and saw Justin Finch- Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming toward him.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of Justin, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER> at the back of the library, measuring <PER>Harry</PER>'s History of Magic homework.
“And <PER>Hermione</PER>’s done four feet seven inches and her writing’s tiny.” “Where is she?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling <PER>Harry</PER>'s own homework.
“All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,” She said, sitting down next to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“The same reason everyone else wants it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.” “What’s that?” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“And I can’t find the story anywhere else — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, let me read your composition,” said <PER>Ron</PER> desperately, checking his watch.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way to History of Magic, bickering.
<PER>Hermione</PER> put up <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
“Miss Grant?” “Please, sir, don’t legends always have a basis in fact?” Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure no student had ever interrupted <PER>Harry</PER> before, alive or dead.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Harry</PER> was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.
“I repeat, if the likes of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> “But maybe you’ve got to be related to Slytherin, so <PER>Dumbledore</PER> couldn’t — ” began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough.
“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin.
<PER>Harry</PER> could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear when <PER>Harry</PER>’d placed the hat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s head a year before: You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that .
“Hiya, <PER>Harry</PER>!” “Hullo, Colin,” said <PER>Harry</PER> automatically.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — a boy in my class has been saying you’re — ” But Colin was so small Colin couldn’t fight against the tide of people bearing Colin toward the Great Hall; they heard Colin squeak, “See you, <PER>Harry</PER>!” and Colin was gone.
“That I’m Slytherin’s heir, I expect,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach dropping another inch or so as <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run away from <PER>Harry</PER> at lunchtime.
“D’you really think there’s a Chamber of Secrets?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Can’t hurt to have a poke around,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, dropping <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and knees so that <PER>Harry</PER> could crawl along, searching for clues.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “have you, <PER>Ron</PER>?
“I never knew that,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking at <PER>Ron</PER> in surprise.
“Level with this door.” <PER>Harry</PER> reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d been burned.
“That’s a girls’ toilet.” “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, there won’t be anyone in there,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, standing up and coming over.
<PER>Hermione</PER> put <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lips and set off toward the end stall.
When <PER>Hermione</PER> reached it <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Hello, Myrtle, how are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went to look.
“This is a girls’ bathroom,” she said, eyeing <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> suspiciously.
“Ask Shis if She saw anything,” <PER>Harry</PER> mouthed at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stood with their mouths open, but <PER>Hermione</PER> shrugged wearily and said, “Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle.
“Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!” “That’s what I told <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said Percy fiercely, “but she still seems to think you’re going to be expelled, I’ve never seen shis so upset, crying shis eyes out, you might think of she, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business — ” “ You don’t care about <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose ears were now reddening.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s surprise, <PER>Hermione</PER> followed suit.
“If you’re talking about <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ” “Of course I am!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You heard him — ‘You’ll be next, MudbloodsV — come on, you’ve only got to look at him's foul rat face to know it’s him — ” “<PER>Malfoy</PER>, the Heir of Slytherin?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> skeptically.
“Look at his family,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s books, too.
“There might be a way,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> slowly, dropping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy.
“What we’d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask <PER>Malfoy</PER> a few questions without <PER>Malfoy</PER> realizing it’s us.” “But that’s impossible,” <PER>Harry</PER> said as <PER>Ron</PER> laughed.
“All we’d need would be some Polyjuice Potion.” “What’s that?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> together.
“<PER>Snape</PER> mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — ” “D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to <PER>Snape</PER>?” muttered <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?” “It wears off after a while,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, waving <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand impatiently.
“Hard to see why we’d want the book, really,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “if we weren’t going to try and make one of the potions.” “I think,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance.
he usually picked <PER>Harry</PER> to help <PER>Harry</PER> with these reconstructions; so far, <PER>Harry</PER> had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with <PER>Harry</PER>.
If <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, <PER>Harry</PER> would have refused to do it.
“Nice loud howl, <PER>Harry</PER> — exactly — and then, if you’ll believe it, I pounced — like this — slammed <PER>Harry</PER> to the floor — thus — with one hand, I managed to hold <PER>Harry</PER> down — with my other, I put my wand to <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat — I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm — <PER>Harry</PER> let out a piteous moan — go on, <PER>Harry</PER> — higher than that — good — the fur vanished — the fangs shrank — and <PER>Harry</PER> turned back into a man.
<PER>Harry</PER> returned to the back of the room, where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waiting.
“All right ” <PER>Hermione</PER> approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> right behind her.
“But the thing is, it’s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it — I’m sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms — ” “Ah, Gadding with GhoulsV’ said Lockhart, taking the note from <PER>Hermione</PER> and smiling widely at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lockhart, while <PER>Hermione</PER> folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag.
“Moste Potente Potions?” she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from <PER>Hermione</PER>; but <PER>Hermione</PER> wouldn’t let go.
<PER>Hermione</PER> put it carefully into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had overridden <PER>Ron</PER>’s objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy.
Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s stall, but they were ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> they.
“Here it is,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> excitedly as <PER>Hermione</PER> found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion.
“Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,” <PER>Hermione</PER> murmured, running <PER>Hermione</PER>'s finger down the list of ingredients.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> could have attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!” But <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and “<PER>Malfoy</PER> added swiftly, “But it’s the best plan we’ve got, so full steam ahead, I say.” However, while <PER>Hermione</PER> was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, “It’ll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock <PER>Malfoy</PER> off his broom tomorrow.” <PER>Harry</PER> woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match.
After half an hour of lying there with <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides churning, <PER>Harry</PER> got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where <PER>Harry</PER> found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> came hurrying over to wish <PER>Harry</PER> good luck as <PER>Harry</PER> entered the locker rooms.
“I haven’t been properly dry since August”) “ — and we’re going to make them rue the day them let that little bit of slime, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, buy his way onto their team.” Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’ll be down to you, <PER>Harry</PER>, to show you, <PER>Harry</PER> that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father.
“All right there, Scarhead?” yelled <PER>Malfoy</PER>, shooting underneath <PER>Harry</PER> as though to show off the speed of <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for <PER>Harry</PER> again.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the Bludger whistling along behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, but Fred was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to <PER>Harry</PER>, the Bludger pelted after him once more and <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to fly off at full speed.
It had started to rain; <PER>Harry</PER> felt heavy drops fall onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, splattering onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until <PER>Harry</PER> heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, “Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero — ” The Slytherins’ superior brooms were clearly doing ’ superior brooms's jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock <PER>Harry</PER> out of the air.
Fred and George were now flying so close to <PER>Harry</PER> on either side that <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.
Over Madam Hooch's shoulder, <PER>Harry</PER> could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s direction.
“You can’t let <PER>Harry</PER> deal with that thing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
On Madam Hooch’s whistle, <PER>Harry</PER> kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
Higher and higher <PER>Harry</PER> climbed; <PER>Harry</PER> looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled.
Slightly dizzy, <PER>Harry</PER> nevertheless kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes wide open, rain was speckling <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and ran up <PER>Harry</PER>'s nostrils as <PER>Harry</PER> hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear laughter from the crowd; <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> must look very stupid, but the Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change direction as quickly as <PER>Harry</PER> could; <PER>Harry</PER> began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood — A whistling in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear told <PER>Harry</PER> the Bludger had just missed <PER>Harry</PER> again; <PER>Harry</PER> turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.
“Training for the ballet, Potter?” yelled <PER>Malfoy</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at <PER>Malfoy</PER> in hatred, him saw the Bludger — the Golden Snitch.
It was hovering inches above <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s left ear — and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, busy laughing at <PER>Harry</PER>, hadn’t seen it.
For an agonizing moment, <PER>Harry</PER> hung in midair, not daring to speed toward <PER>Malfoy</PER> in case <PER>Harry</PER> looked up and saw the Snitch.
The Bludger had hit The Bludger at last, smashed into The Bludger's elbow, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm break.
Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, his slid sideways on his rain- drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side — The Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time aiming at his face — <PER>Harry</PER> swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in — <PER>Harry</PER>'s numb brain: get to <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Through a haze of rain and pain — <PER>Harry</PER> dived for the shimmering, sneering face below <PER>Harry</PER> and saw its eyes widen with fear: <PER>Malfoy</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was attacking <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What the — ” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, careening out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s way.
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s remaining hand off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom and made a wild snatch; <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as <PER>Harry</PER> headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out.
“<PER>Harry</PER> should really, Professor,” said a muddy Wood, who couldn’t help grinning even though <PER>Harry</PER>'s Seeker was injured.
“Great capture, <PER>Harry</PER>, really spectacular, your best yet, I’d say — ” Through the thicket of legs around him, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box.
“No — don’t — ” said <PER>Harry</PER> weakly, but Lockhart was twirling <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and a second later had directed it straight at <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
A strange and unpleasant sensation started at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder and spread all the way down to <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingertips.
“How can you stick up for Lockhart now, <PER>Hermione</PER>, eh?” <PER>Ron</PER> called through the curtain as he pulled <PER>Harry</PER>’s limp fingers through the cuff.
“If <PER>Harry</PER> had wanted deboning <PER>Harry</PER> would have asked.” “Anyone can make a mistake,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And it doesn’t hurt anymore, does it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, getting into bed.
Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to help <PER>Harry</PER> gulp down some water.
Hours and hours later, <PER>Harry</PER> woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: <PER>Harry</PER> arm now felt full of large splinters.
For a second, <PER>Harry</PER> thought that was what had woken <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then, with a thrill of horror, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that someone was sponging <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead in the dark.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter came back to school,” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter whispered miserably.
“Dobby hid and watched for <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward” — he showed <PER>Harry</PER> ten long, bandaged fingers — “but Dobby didn’t care, sir, for he thought <PER>Harry</PER> Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter would get to school another way!” he was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.
“You nearly got <PER>Ron</PER> and me expelled,” <PER>Ron</PER> and me said fiercely.
“Dark deeds are planned in this place, but <PER>Harry</PER> Potter must not be here when they happen — go home, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, go home.
“Go home, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, go home!” “I’m not going anywhere!” said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely.
“One of my best friends is Muggle-born; she’ll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened — ” “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter risks “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter's own life for “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter's friends!” moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s slumped back into bed, <PER>Harry</PER>’s's eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer.
“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> hurried past the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed out of sight.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard urgent voices, and then Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> swept back into view, closely followed by Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress.
Slowly and carefully, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER> a few inches so <PER>Harry</PER> could look at the statue on the bed.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stared at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm reboned but very stiff.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat up quickly and looked over at Colin’s bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains <PER>Harry</PER> had changed behind yesterday.
“When you’ve finished eating, you may leave.” <PER>Harry</PER> dressed as quickly as <PER>Harry</PER> could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about Colin and Dobby, but they weren’t there.
<PER>Harry</PER> left to look for they, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren’t interested in whether <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s bones back or not.
“I hope <PER>Ron</PER>’s not in another girls’ toilet ” <PER>Harry</PER> forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Percy couldn’t see why <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, Percy opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall.
“We ’d’ve come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,” <PER>Ron</PER> explained as <PER>Harry</PER>, with difficulty, locked the stall again.
“We’ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.” <PER>Harry</PER> started to tell them about Colin, but <PER>Hermione</PER> interrupted.
“Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up, amazed.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> listened with their mouths open.
“Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> must’ve opened the Chamber when “Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> must’ve was at school here and now “Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> must’ve’s told dear old <PER>Malfoy</PER> how to do it.
“Or maybe it can disguise it — pretend to be a suit of armor or something — I’ve read about Chameleon Ghouls — ” “You read too much, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches.
<PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> signed her list; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had heard that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was staying, which struck them as very suspicious.
<PER>Harry</PER> privately felt <PER>Harry</PER>’d rather face Slytherin’s legendary monster than let <PER>Snape</PER> catch him robbing him's office.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was <PER>Snape</PER>’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say “Unfair.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s Swelling Solution had <PER>Harry</PER>’s Swelling Solution's mind on more important things.
He was waiting for <PER>Hermione</PER>’s signal, and He hardly listened as <PER>Snape</PER> paused to sneer at <PER>Snape</PER>'s watery potion.
When <PER>Snape</PER> turned and walked off to bully <PER>Neville</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and nodded.
<PER>Harry</PER> ducked swiftly down behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron, pulled one of Fred’s Filibuster fireworks out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> got a faceful and <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hands over <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate — <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened.
Through the confusion, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> slip quietly into <PER>Snape</PER>’s office.
“Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draught — when I find out who did this — ” <PER>Harry</PER> tried not to laugh as <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> hurry forward, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon.
As half the class lumbered up to <PER>Snape</PER> ’s desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed- up lips, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> slide back into the dungeon, the front of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes bulging.
“If I ever find out who threw this,” <PER>Snape</PER> whispered, “I shall make sure that person is expelled.” <PER>Harry</PER> arranged his face into what <PER>Harry</PER> hoped was a puzzled expression.
<PER>Snape</PER> was looking right at <PER>Snape</PER>, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome.
“He knew it was me,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
“<PER>Snape</PER> can’t prove it was you,” said <PER>Ron</PER> reassuringly to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What can <PER>Snape</PER> do?” “Knowing <PER>Snape</PER>, something foul,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as the potion frothed and bubbled.
A week later, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were walking across the entrance hall when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up.
“Could be useful,” he said to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> went into dinner.
“Shall we go?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were all for it, so at eight o’clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall.
“Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young — maybe it’ll be he.” “As long as it’s not — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but <PER>Harry</PER> ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than <PER>Snape</PER>, wearing his usual black.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why Lockhart was still smiling; if <PER>Snape</PER> had been looking at <PER>Harry</PER> like that <PER>Harry</PER>’d have been running as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could in the opposite direction.
Lockhart and <PER>Snape</PER> turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of Lockhart's hands, whereas <PER>Snape</PER> jerked his head irritably.
Then Lockhart and <PER>Snape</PER> raised Lockhart and <PER>Snape</PER>'s wands like swords in front of Lockhart and <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Who cares?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
Lockhart teamed <PER>Neville</PER> with Justin Finch- Fletchley, but <PER>Snape</PER> reached <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> first.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Hermione</PER>'s a weak smile that <PER>Hermione</PER> did not return.
“And bow!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> barely inclined their heads, not taking <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes off each other.
“When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents — only to disarm your opponents — we don’t want any accidents — one two three — ” <PER>Harry</PER> swung his wand high, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> had already started on “two”: His spell hit <PER>Harry</PER> so hard <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d been hit over the head with a saucepan.
<PER>Harry</PER> stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand straight at <PER>Malfoy</PER> and shouted, “Rictusempral” A jet of silver light hit <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the stomach and <PER>Harry</PER> doubled up, wheezing.
“I said disarm only\” Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as <PER>Malfoy</PER> sank to his knees; <PER>Harry</PER> had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and <PER>Harry</PER> could barely move for laughing.
<PER>Harry</PER> hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch <PER>Malfoy</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER> was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, <PER>Malfoy</PER> pointed his wand at <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees, choked, “Tarantallegral” and the next second <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs began to jerk around out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s control in a kind of quickstep.
“Finite Incantatem\” he shouted; <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet stopped dancing, <PER>Malfoy</PER> stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.
Both <PER>Neville</PER> and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; <PER>Ron</PER> was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but <PER>Hermione</PER> and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving; Millicent had <PER>Hermione</PER> in a headlock and <PER>Hermione</PER> was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor.
“How about <PER>Malfoy</PER> and Potter?” said <PER>Snape</PER> with a twisted smile.
“Excellent idea!” said Lockhart, gesturing <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> room.
<PER>Snape</PER> smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, “Whoops — my wand is a little overexcited — ” <PER>Snape</PER> moved closer to <PER>Malfoy</PER>, bent down, and whispered something in his ear.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, “Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?” “Scared?” muttered <PER>Malfoy</PER>, so that Lockhart couldn’t hear Lockhart.
“You wish,” said <PER>Harry</PER> out of the corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> raised <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand quickly and bellowed, “ Serpensortial” The end of his wand exploded.
“Don’t move, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of <PER>Harry</PER> standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure what made <PER>Harry</PER> do it.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs were carrying him forward as though him was on casters and that him had shouted stupidly at the snake, “Leave him alone!” And miraculously — inexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, the snake eyes now on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt the fear drain out of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew the snake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how <PER>Harry</PER> knew the snake, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t have explained.
“What do you think you’re playing at?” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.
<PER>Snape</PER> stepped forward, waved <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke.
<PER>Snape</PER>, too, was looking at <PER>Harry</PER> in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like it.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> felt a tugging on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Move — come on—” <PER>Ron</PER> steered him out of the hall, <PER>Hermione</PER> hurrying alongside them.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have a clue what was going on, and neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER> into an armchair and said, “You’re a Parselmouth.
Through a gap in the curtains around <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster <PER>Harry</PER> watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered Could <PER>Harry</PER> be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin?
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know anything about <PER>Harry</PER>'s father’s family, after all.
<PER>Harry</PER> fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> used their time off to play a game of wizard chess.
“For heaven’s sake, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, exasperated, as one of <PER>Ron</PER>’s bishops wrestled <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knight off his horse and dragged him off the board.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s friend into a badger.
Resisting the urge to take a look, <PER>Harry</PER> walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using <PER>Harry</PER>'s free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first.
<PER>Harry</PER> was walking toward them when something of what them were saying met <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears, and <PER>Harry</PER> paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section.
“All I saw,” said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, “was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.” “I didn’t chase it at him!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice shaking with anger.
<PER>Harry</PER> blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where <PER>Harry</PER> was going, <PER>Harry</PER> was in such a fury.
The result was that <PER>Harry</PER> walked into something very large and solid, which knocked <PER>Harry</PER> backward onto the floor.
“Oh, hello, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking up.
“It’s either foxes or a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, an’ I need the headmaster’s permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.” He peered more closely at <PER>Harry</PER> from under <PER>Harry</PER>'s thick, snow-flecked eyebrows.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, <PER>Harry</PER>'s breathing fast and shallow, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart doing a kind of drumroll against <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs.
he flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>, screamed, “ATTACK!
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> came running, followed by Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s own class, one of whom still had black-and-white- striped hair.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> used Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into everyone's classes.
As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song: “Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, You’re killing off students, you think it’s good fun — ” “That’s enough, Peeves!” barked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s tongue out at <PER>Harry</PER>.
In the end, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> conjured a large fan out of thin air, which Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs.
This left <PER>Harry</PER> and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> alone together.
“Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, “I swear I didn’t — ” “This is out of my hands, Potter,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> curtly.
As he and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stepped onto it, <PER>Harry</PER> heard the wall thud closed behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew now where <PER>Harry</PER> was being taken.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> to wait and left <PER>Harry</PER> there, alone.
One thing was certain: of all the teachers’ offices <PER>Harry</PER> had visited so far this year, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s was by far the most interesting.
If <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s hadn’t been scared out of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s's wits that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s was about to be thrown out of school, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it.
Then a small voice said in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear, “Bee in your bonnet, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” “Er, yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
Then a strange, gagging noise behind <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER> wheel around.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as <PER>Harry</PER> watched, a couple more feathers fell out of Its tail.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just thinking that all <PER>Harry</PER> needed was for <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s pet bird to die while <PER>Harry</PER> was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.
“Your bird — I couldn’t do anything — he just caught fire — ” To <PER>Harry</PER>’s astonishment, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled.
Before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and <PER>Hagrid</PER> burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.
“It wasn’ <PER>Harry</PER>, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> urgently.
“I was talkin’ ter him seconds before that kid was found, him never had time, sir — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tried to say something, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> went ranting on, waving the rooster around in sir —'s agitation, sending feathers everywhere.
“ — it can’t’ve bin him, I’ll swear it in front o’ the Ministry o’ Magic if I have to — ” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, I — ” “ — yeh’ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know <PER>Harry</PER> never “<PER>Hagrid</PER>l” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> loudly.
“I do not think that <PER>Harry</PER> attacked those people.” “Oh,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the rooster falling limply at his side.
“You don’t think it was me, Professor?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated hopefully as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> brushed rooster feathers off his desk.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, though <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was somber again.
“But I still want to talk to you.” <PER>Harry</PER> waited nervously while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> considered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long fingers together.
“I must ask you, <PER>Harry</PER>, whether there is anything you’d like to tell me,” <PER>Harry</PER> said gently.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of <PER>Malfoy</PER> shouting, “You’ll be next, Mudbloods!” and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> thought of the disembodied voice <PER>Harry</PER> had heard twice and remembered what <PER>Ron</PER> had said: “ Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.” he thought, too, about what everyone was saying about he, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin.
“At this rate, well be the only ones left,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was tired of people skirting around <PER>Harry</PER> in the corridors, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as <PER>Harry</PER> passed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s in a hurry.” “Yeah, <PER>Harry</PER>’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with <PER>Harry</PER>'s fanged servant,” said George, chortling.
“Oh, don’t,” she wailed every time Fred asked <PER>Harry</PER> loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward <PER>Harry</PER> off with a large clove of garlic when they met.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t mind; it made <PER>Harry</PER> feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of <PER>Harry</PER>'s being Slytherin ’s heir was quite ludicrous.
But their antics seemed to be aggravating <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.
<PER>Harry</PER> found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by <PER>Hermione</PER>, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> — you’re not supposed to be in here — ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shielding his eyes against the light.
“Are you sure?” “Positive,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shirting Scabbers the rat so that <PER>Hermione</PER> could sit down on the end of <PER>Ron</PER>’s four- poster.
“Hello,” said <PER>Harry</PER> happily as she landed on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
They had sent <PER>Harry</PER> a toothpick and a note telling <PER>Harry</PER> to find out whether <PER>Harry</PER>’d be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had sent him a large tin of treacle toffee, which <PER>Harry</PER> decided to soften by the fire before eating; <PER>Ron</PER> had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill.
<PER>Harry</PER> read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mister Weasley’s car (which hadn’t been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule- breaking he and <PER>Ron</PER> were planning next.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> led them in a few of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s favorite carols, <PER>Hagrid</PER> booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t even care that <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was making loud, snide remarks about <PER>Harry</PER>'s new sweater from the Slytherin table.
With a bit of luck, <PER>Malfoy</PER> would be getting <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s comeuppance in a few hours’ time.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when <PER>Hermione</PER> ushered their out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.
“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing into,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> matter-of-factly, as though <PER>Hermione</PER> were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent.
“And obviously, it’ll be best if you can get something of Crabbe’s and Goyle’s; they’re <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s best friends, he’ll tell <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s best friends anything.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I don’t think — ” “That could go seriously wrong — ” But <PER>Hermione</PER> had a steely glint in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eye not unlike the one Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> sometimes had.
“You do want to investigate <PER>Malfoy</PER>, don’t you?” “Oh, all right, all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?” But to <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as <PER>Hermione</PER> had said.
When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.
Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, <PER>Harry</PER> yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle ’s forehead and <PER>Ron</PER> pulled out several of Crabbe ’s hairs.
Pulling their robes up over their faces, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> knocked softly on the door.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>?” They heard the scrape of the lock and <PER>Hermione</PER> emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious.
Then, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand trembling, <PER>Hermione</PER> shook Millicent Bulstrode’s hair out of its bottle into the first glass.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and <PER>Ron</PER> put Crabbe’s into the last one.
“Hang on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> reached for their glasses.
“Ready,” came <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voices.
With difficulty, <PER>Harry</PER> kicked off <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoes and stood up.
<PER>Harry</PER> unlocked <PER>Harry</PER>'s door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror.
<PER>Harry</PER> scratched <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear.
“That’s how he looks every time a teacher asks he a question.” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, are you okay?” said <PER>Harry</PER> through the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off.
“Don’t swing your arms like that,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe’s and Goyle’s huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn’t going to be as easy as they had hoped.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was strolling toward them, and for the first time in <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s life, <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“I don’t like your attitude!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> sneered and motioned for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to follow him.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried after <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who said as they turned into the next passage, “That Peter Weasley — ” “Percy,” <PER>Ron</PER> corrected him automatically.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged excited looks.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> marched through it, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed him.
“Wait here,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire.
“I’ll go and get it — my father’s just sent it to me — ” Wondering what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was going to show them, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down, doing them's best to look at home.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> thrust it under <PER>Ron</PER>’s nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER>'s eyes widen in shock.
<PER>Harry</PER> read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and handed the clipping to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> impatiently as <PER>Harry</PER> handed the clipping back to him.
“What’s the matter with you two?” Far too late, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> forced themselves to laugh, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake.
Fortunately, <PER>Malfoy</PER> didn’t notice, and <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking fast, said, “You must have some idea who’s behind it all.
Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if <PER>Ron</PER> punched <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> shot him a warning look and said, “D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?” “Oh, yeah whoever it was was expelled,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
his nose was also slowly lengthening — their hour was up, <PER>Ron</PER> was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror himself was suddenly giving <PER>Harry</PER>, himself must be, too.
“Medicine for my stomach,” <PER>Ron</PER> grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that <PER>Malfoy</PER> hadn’t noticed anything.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet slipping around in Goyle’s huge shoes and had to hoist up <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes as <PER>Harry</PER> shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they’d locked Crabbe and Goyle.
“I know we still haven’t found out who’s doing the attacks, but I’m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’ drawing room.” <PER>Harry</PER> checked him's face in the cracked mirror.
him put him's glasses on as <PER>Ron</PER> hammered on the door of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s stall.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you — ” “Go away!” <PER>Hermione</PER> squeaked.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at each other.
“It’s awful — ” They heard the lock slide back and <PER>Hermione</PER> emerged, sobbing, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes pulled up over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
“Have you still got Millicent’s nose or something?” <PER>Hermione</PER> let <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes fall and <PER>Ron</PER> backed into the sink.
“It’s okay, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bed, to spare <PER>Hermione</PER>'s the shame of being seen with a furry face.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went to visit her every evening.
“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, tipping a stack of books onto <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bedside table one evening.
“Don’t be silly, <PER>Ron</PER>, I’ve got to keep up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face and Her's eyes were turning slowly back to brown.
“I was so sure it was <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, for about the hundredth time.
“What’s that?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing to something gold sticking out from under <PER>Hermione</PER>’s pillow.
“Just a get well card,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but <PER>Ron</PER> was too quick for <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud: “To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award.” <PER>Ron</PER> looked up at <PER>Hermione</PER>, disgusted.
“You sleep with this under your pillow?” But <PER>Hermione</PER> was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s evening dose of medicine.
“Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you’ve ever met, or what?” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER> as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower.
<PER>Snape</PER> had given them so much homework, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was likely to be in the sixth year before <PER>Harry</PER> finished it.
<PER>Ron</PER> was just saying <PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had asked <PER>Hermione</PER> how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a Hair-Raising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears.
<PER>Harry</PER> stepped forward to pick It up, but <PER>Ron</PER> suddenly flung out an arm to hold <PER>Harry</PER> back.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told <PER>Harry</PER> it was fifty years old.
“Hang on,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had approached cautiously and was looking over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, <PER>Harry</PER> showed her T. M. <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary and told her the story of how they had found it.
“I wouldn’t mind knowing how <PER>Riddle</PER> got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.” “Could’ve been anything,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“That’s what <PER>Malfoy</PER> said.” “Yeah ” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly.
“So?” “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, wake up,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Undaunted, <PER>Hermione</PER> shoved <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand back into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.
“<PER>Riddle</PER> just got a diary for Christmas and couldn’t be bothered filling a diary for Christmas in.” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t explain, even to <PER>Harry</PER>, why <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t just throw <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary away.
The fact was that even though <PER>Harry</PER> knew the diary was blank, <PER>Harry</PER> kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to finish.
And while <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard the name T. M. <PER>Riddle</PER> before, it still seemed to mean something to <PER>Harry</PER>, almost as though <PER>Riddle</PER> was a friend he’d had when he was very small, and had half-forgotten.
Nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER> was determined to find out more about <PER>Riddle</PER>, so next day at break, <PER>Harry</PER> headed for the trophy room to examine <PER>Riddle</PER>’s special award, accompanied by an interested <PER>Hermione</PER> and a thoroughly unconvinced <PER>Ron</PER>, who told them <PER>Harry</PER>’d seen enough of the trophy room to <PER>Harry</PER> a lifetime.
<PER>Riddle</PER>’s burnished gold shield didn’t carry details of why it had been given to him (“Good thing, too, or it’d be even bigger and I’d still be polishing it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>).
<PER>Harry</PER> overheard him telling Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch practice the night before, and <PER>Harry</PER> hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late.
<PER>Harry</PER> went over to the Gryffindor table, where <PER>Ron</PER> was sitting looking sickened, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have been overcome with giggles.
“What’s going on?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off <PER>Harry</PER>'s bacon.
From where him sat, <PER>Harry</PER> could see a muscle going in Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s cheek.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked as though someone had just fed <PER>Snape</PER> a large beaker of Skele-Gro.
“Please, <PER>Hermione</PER>, tell me you weren’t one of the forty-six,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson.
<PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly became very interested in searching <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag for <PER>Hermione</PER>'s schedule and didn’t answer.
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to escape.
“Stay stilll” grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bag and pulling <PER>Harry</PER> back.
“What’s going on here?” came the cold, drawling voice of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> started stuffing everything feverishly into <PER>Harry</PER>'s ripped bag, desperate to get away before <PER>Malfoy</PER> could hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s musical valentine.
Losing his head, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized <PER>Harry</PER> around the knees and brought <PER>Harry</PER> crashing to the floor.
“And you, <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ” <PER>Harry</PER>, glancing over, saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> stoop and snatch up something.
Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER>’d got <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary.
“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who obviously hadn’t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had <PER>Harry</PER>’s own diary.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was staring from the diary to <PER>Harry</PER>, looking terrified.
“When I’ve had a look,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, waving the diary tauntingly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Percy said, “As a school prefect — ” but <PER>Harry</PER> had lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and shouted, “ ExpelliarmusV’ and just as <PER>Snape</PER> had disarmed Lockhart, so <PER>Malfoy</PER> found the diary shooting out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand into the air.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was looking furious, and as <PER>Ginny</PER> passed him to enter her classroom, him yelled spitefully after her, “I don’t think Potter liked your valentine much!” <PER>Ginny</PER> covered her face with her hands and ran into class.
Snarling, <PER>Ron</PER> pulled out his wand, too, but <PER>Harry</PER> pulled him away.
It wasn’t until they had reached Professor Flitwick’s class that <PER>Harry</PER> noticed something rather odd about <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary.
He tried to point this out to <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and He wasn’t much interested in anything else.
Jc Jc Jc <PER>Harry</PER> went to bed before anyone else in Jc Jc Jc <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory that night.
This was partly because he didn’t think he could stand Fred and George singing, “he eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad” one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary again, and knew that <PER>Ron</PER> thought he was wasting his time.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it.
Excited, <PER>Harry</PER> loaded up <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill a second time and wrote, “My name is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace.
<PER>Riddle</PER>’s reply came quickly, <PER>Riddle</PER>’s's writing becoming untidier, as though <PER>Riddle</PER>’s was hurrying to tell all <PER>Riddle</PER>’s knew.
<PER>Harry</PER> hands trembling slightly, <PER>Harry</PER> raised the book to press <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye against the little window, and before <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was happening, <PER>Harry</PER> was tilting forward; the window was widening, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s body leave <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, and <PER>Harry</PER> was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around <PER>Harry</PER> came suddenly into focus.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew immediately where <PER>Harry</PER> was.
This circular room with the sleeping portraits was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office — but it wasn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> who was sitting behind the desk.
Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past <PER>Harry</PER> without glancing at <PER>Harry</PER>, and went to draw the curtains at <PER>Harry</PER>'s window.
This was Hogwarts as <PER>Riddle</PER> had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster, not <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.
“<PER>Riddle</PER>, do you mean you know something about these attacks?” “No, sir,” said <PER>Riddle</PER> quickly.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was sure it was the same sort of “no” that he himself had given <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Riddle</PER> stopped, and so did <PER>Harry</PER>, watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Riddle</PER> was doing some serious thinking.
<PER>Harry</PER> was biting <PER>Harry</PER>'s lip, <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead furrowed.
Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, <PER>Harry</PER> gliding noiselessly behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was none other than a fifty-year-younger <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Well, hurry off to bed,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, giving <PER>Riddle</PER> exactly the kind of penetrating stare <PER>Harry</PER> knew so well.
<PER>Riddle</PER> watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with <PER>Harry</PER> in hot pursuit.
But to <PER>Harry</PER>’s disappointment, <PER>Riddle</PER> led <PER>Harry</PER> not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which <PER>Harry</PER> had Potions with <PER>Snape</PER>.
The torches hadn’t been lit, and when <PER>Riddle</PER> pushed the door almost closed, <PER>Harry</PER> could only just see <PER>Harry</PER>, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.
All <PER>Harry</PER> could see was the figure of <PER>Riddle</PER> at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue.
And just when All <PER>Harry</PER> had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing All <PER>Harry</PER> could return to the present, All <PER>Harry</PER> heard something move beyond the door.
<PER>Riddle</PER>, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, <PER>Harry</PER> tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t be heard.
And out of it came something that made <PER>Harry</PER> let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone — A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers — <PER>Riddle</PER> raised his wand again, but he was too late.
<PER>Riddle</PER> scrambled to his feet, looking after it; his raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on the huge boy, seized the huge boy's wand, and threw the huge boy back down, yelling, “NOOOOOOO!” The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> falling and, with a crash, <PER>Harry</PER> landed spread-eagled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary lying open on his stomach.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> had had time to regain <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, the dormitory door opened and <PER>Ron</PER> came in.
“What’s up?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking at <PER>Harry</PER> with concern.
“It was <PER>Hagrid</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>.
During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d christened “Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, <PER>Hagrid</PER> had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER>’d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of <PER>Harry</PER>’d.
<PER>Harry</PER>’d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; <PER>Harry</PER> could just imagine the thirteen-year-old <PER>Hagrid</PER> trying to fit a leash and collar on it.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was equally certain that <PER>Hagrid</PER> would never have meant to kill anybody.
<PER>Harry</PER> half wished <PER>Harry</PER> half hadn’t found out how to work <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary.
Again and again <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> made him recount what he’d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.
“<PER>Riddle</PER> might have got the wrong person,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“We always knew <PER>Hagrid</PER> had been expelled,” said <PER>Harry</PER> miserably.
“<PER>Riddle</PER> does sound like Percy — who asked him to squeal on <PER>Hagrid</PER>, anyway?” “But the monster had killed someone, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And “<PER>Riddle</PER> was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Do you think we should go and ask <PER>Hagrid</PER> about it all?” “That’d be a cheerful visit,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It could affect our whole future,” she told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking they with checks.
“I haven’t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.” <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom's family, all giving <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom different advice on what to choose.
Dean Thomas, who, like <PER>Harry</PER>, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and jabbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on.
<PER>Harry</PER> smiled grimly to <PER>Harry</PER> at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if <PER>Harry</PER> tried to discuss <PER>Harry</PER>'s career in wizardry with them.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — I don’t know who did it — I just found — ” Watching <PER>Harry</PER> fearfully, <PER>Neville</PER> pushed open the door.
As he and <PER>Neville</PER> pulled the blankets back onto his bed, <PER>Ron</PER>, Dean, and Seamus came in.
“What happened, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “No idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
But <PER>Ron</PER> was examining <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes.
“Is there anything missing?” <PER>Harry</PER> started to pick up all <PER>Harry</PER>'s things and throw them into <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk.
“<PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary’s gone,” he said in an undertone to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What?” <PER>Harry</PER> jerked his head toward the dormitory door and <PER>Ron</PER> followed him out.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.” <PER>Harry</PER> had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary was right in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had been urging <PER>Harry</PER> to report the robbery, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like the idea.
As He left the Great Hall with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to <PER>Harry</PER>’s growing list.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just set foot on the marble staircase when <PER>Harry</PER> heard it yet again — “ Kill this time let me rip tear ” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted aloud and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both jumped away from <PER>Harry</PER> in alarm.
“The voice!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, clapped a hand to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s forehead.
“But why’s she got to go to the library?” “Because that’s what <PER>Hermione</PER> does,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shrugging.
“When in doubt, go to the library.” <PER>Harry</PER> stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind <PER>Harry</PER>, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on people's way to the Quidditch pitch.
“It’s nearly eleven — the match — ” <PER>Harry</PER> raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as his pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just mounting <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom when Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s surprise, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> didn’t object.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> back into the school and up the marble staircase.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> pushed the door open and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> entered.
And on the bed next to her was — “<PER>Hermione</PER>Y’ <PER>Ron</PER> groaned.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> shook their heads, both staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> had turned <PER>Hagrid</PER> in because Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed.
<PER>Harry</PER> now knew exactly how <PER>Harry</PER> had felt.
“What’re we going to do?” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
“D’you think they suspect <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “We’ve got to go and talk to him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making up <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
“I can’t believe it’s <PER>Harry</PER> this time, but if <PER>Harry</PER> set the monster loose last time him’ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.” “But <PER>McGonagall</PER> said we’ve got to stay in we tower unless we’re in class — ” “I think,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, more quietly still, “it’s time to get my dad’s old cloak out again.” <PER>Harry</PER> had inherited just one thing from <PER>Harry</PER>'s father: a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak.
Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when <PER>Ron</PER> stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where <PER>Snape</PER> stood standing guard.
Thankfully, <PER>Snape</PER> sneezed at almost exactly the moment <PER>Ron</PER> swore.
They hurried toward the lit windows of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s house and pulled off the cloak only when They were right outside <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s's front door.
“Did you hear about <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, a slight break in his voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged panic-stricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner.
“Good evening, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.” It was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge, the Minister of Magic!” <PER>Harry</PER> elbowed <PER>Ron</PER> hard to make him shut up.
He dropped into one of He's chairs and looked from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge.
“You know I never, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sir — ” “I want it understood, <PER>Cornelius</PER>, that <PER>Hagrid</PER> has my full confidence,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, frowning at Fudge.
It was <PER>Harry</PER>’s turn for an elbow in the ribs; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d let out an audible gasp.
Mister Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> strode into <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile.
“ Dreadful thing, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, “but the governors feel it’s time for you to step aside.
“And as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has failed to stop these attacks — ” “See here, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> can’t stop them,” said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, “I mean to say, who can?” “That remains to be seen,” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> with a nasty smile.
“Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not taken <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s bright blue eyes off Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s cold gray ones.
Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for <PER>Hagrid</PER> to go ahead of his, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said carefully, “If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they’d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders.
But with no <PER>Hagrid</PER> visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at Fang's heels, the scene didn’t look right to <PER>Harry</PER>; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had tried to visit <PER>Hermione</PER>, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.
<PER>Harry</PER> constantly repeated <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s final words to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked everywhere <PER>Harry</PER> went, helped (rather reluctantly) by <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was strutting around the school as though <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had just been appointed Head Boy.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t realize what <PER>Harry</PER> was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> had left, when, sitting right behind <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“Sir, why don’t you apply for the headmaster’s job?” “Now, now, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, though he couldn’t suppress a thin-lipped smile.
“I expect you’d have Father’s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job — I’ll tell Father you’re the best teacher here, sir <PER>Snape</PER> smirked as sir <PER>Snape</PER> swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into sir <PER>Snape</PER>'s cauldron.
“Let me at him,” <PER>Ron</PER> growled as <PER>Harry</PER> and Dean hung onto his arms.
“I don’t care, I don’t need my wand, I’m going to kill him with my bare hands — ” “Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,” barked <PER>Snape</PER> over the class’s heads, and off they marched, with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Dean bringing up the rear, <PER>Ron</PER> still trying to get loose.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found <PER>Harry</PER> face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan.
Ernie and <PER>Harry</PER>'s friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“That <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> character,” said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, “Ernie seems very pleased about all this, doesn’t he?
“Do you think it’s <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>?” Ernie asked.
<PER>Harry</PER> hit <PER>Ron</PER> over the hand with his pruning shears.
“Ouch\ What ’re you — ” <PER>Harry</PER> pointed out the spiders, following the spiders's progress with <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes screwed up against the sun.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes narrowed as <PER>Harry</PER> focused on the spiders.
<PER>Ron</PER> started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when <PER>Harry</PER> kicked him hard under the desk.
But Lockhart’s disgusting cheeriness, Lockhart’s's hints that Lockhart had always thought <PER>Hagrid</PER> was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated <PER>Harry</PER> so much that <PER>Harry</PER> yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart’s stupid face.
Instead he contented he with scrawling a note to <PER>Ron</PER>: Let’s do it tonight <PER>Ron</PER> read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear.
Fred and George challenged <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to a few games of Exploding Snap, and <PER>Ginny</PER> sat watching them, very subdued in <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s usual chair.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> finally went to bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole.
<PER>Harry</PER> left the Invisibility Cloak on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s table.
“C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, patting <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.
<PER>Harry</PER> took out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, murmured, “Lumos\” and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside <PER>Harry</PER>'s little sphere of light was pitch-black.
<PER>Harry</PER> could vividly remember <PER>Hagrid</PER> advising <PER>Harry</PER> not to leave the forest path last time He’d been in here.
Something wet touched <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and <PER>Harry</PER> jumped backward, crushing <PER>Ron</PER>’s foot, but it was only Fang’s nose.
“What d’you reckon?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel Fang’s hot breath on <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> jump out of their skins.
“What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s elbow very hard.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, his voice breaking with relief.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, it’s our car!” “What?” “Come on!” <PER>Harry</PER> blundered after <PER>Ron</PER> toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.
him breathing slowing down again, <PER>Harry</PER> stuffed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly <PER>Harry</PER> felt something long and hairy seize <PER>Harry</PER> around the middle and lift <PER>Harry</PER> off the ground, so that <PER>Harry</PER> was hanging facedown.
Struggling, terrified, <PER>Harry</PER> heard more clicking, and saw <PER>Ron</PER>’s legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling — next moment, Fang was being swept away into the dark trees.
Head hanging, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that what had hold of <PER>Harry</PER> was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching <PER>Harry</PER> tightly below a pair of shining black pincers.
Behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear Fang fighting to free Fang from a third monster, whining loudly, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t have yelled even if Fang had wanted to; <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to have left <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice back with the car in the clearing.
<PER>Harry</PER> never knew how long <PER>Harry</PER> was in the creature’s clutches; <PER>Harry</PER> only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for <PER>Harry</PER> to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders.
Craning <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck sideways, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene <PER>Harry</PER> had ever laid eyes on.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Fang thudded down next to <PER>Ron</PER> and Fang.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked exactly like <PER>Harry</PER> felt.
<PER>Harry</PER> mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes were popping.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped <PER>Harry</PER> was saying something.
It had been hard to tell, because <PER>Harry</PER> clicked <PER>Harry</PER>'s pincers with every word he spoke.
“Is it <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said Aragog, moving closer, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s in trouble,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, breathing very fast.
“That’s why we’ve come.” “In trouble?” said the aged spider, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard concern beneath the clicking pincers.
“But why has <PER>Harry</PER> sent you?” <PER>Harry</PER> thought of getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet but decided against it; <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t think <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs would support <PER>Harry</PER>.
So <PER>Harry</PER> spoke from the ground, as calmly as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
Aragog was backing slowly into Aragog's domed web, but Aragog's fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well just go, then,” <PER>Harry</PER> called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
Even as he reached for his wand, <PER>Harry</PER> knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow.
Arthur’s car screeched to a halt in front of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and the doors flew open.
“Get Fang!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, diving into the front seat; <PER>Ron</PER> seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car — the doors slammed shut — <PER>Ron</PER> didn’t touch the accelerator but the car didn’t need — <PER>Ron</PER>; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> mouth was still open in the silent scream, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes weren’t popping anymore.
Fang flung Fang at the window in Fang's anxiety to get out, and when <PER>Harry</PER> opened the door, <PER>Harry</PER> shot off through the trees to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house, tail between Fang's legs.
<PER>Harry</PER> got out too, and after a minute or so, <PER>Hagrid</PER> seemed to regain the feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back into <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak.
When <PER>Harry</PER> got outside again, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER> being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.
“That’s exactly <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s problem!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, thumping the wall of the cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat on the edge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs up onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and leaned back against <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillows, watching the moon glinting at <PER>Harry</PER> through the tower window.
<PER>Harry</PER> was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly sat bolt upright.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” he hissed through the dark, “<PER>Ron</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER> woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly around, and saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We’re still getting exams?” There was a loud bang behind <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom’s wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> restored it with a wave of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus.
“And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the pair of white rabbits <PER>Harry</PER> was supposed to be turning into slippers.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d just been told <PER>Harry</PER> had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest.
“Can you imagine me taking exams with this?” he asked <PER>Harry</PER>, holding up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, which had just started whistling loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn’t at all surprised to see that <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> hadn’t joined in.
<PER>Ginny</PER> didn’t say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded <PER>Harry</PER> of someone, though he couldn’t think who.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized who <PER>Ginny</PER> looked like.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was rocking backward and forward slightly in <PER>Ginny</PER>'s chair, exactly like Dobby did when Dobby was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.
“I’ve got to tell you something,” <PER>Ginny</PER> mumbled, carefully not looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> looked as though <PER>Ginny</PER> couldn’t find the right words.
<PER>Ginny</PER> opened <PER>Ginny</PER>'s mouth, but no sound came out.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> could hear him.
“Pass me those rolls, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m starving.” <PER>Harry</PER> knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help, but <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up — and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.
“The first words out of those poor Petrified people’s mouths will be ‘It was <PER>Hagrid</PER>.’ Frankly, I’m astounded Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> thinks all these security measures are necessary.” “I agree, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making <PER>Ron</PER> drop his books in surprise.
“We were going to — to go and see — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> both looked at him.
“We haven’t seen her for ages, Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on hurriedly, treading on <PER>Ron</PER>’s foot, “and we thought we’d sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry — ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was still staring at him, and for a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice.
As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> blow Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s nose.
“That,” said <PER>Ron</PER> fervently, “was the best story you’ve ever come up with.” They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that They had Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s permission to visit <PER>Hermione</PER>.
It was plain that <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t have the faintest inkling that <PER>Hermione</PER> had visitors, and that they might just as well tell <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.
“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking sadly at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s rigid face.
“Try and get it out,” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked <PER>Harry</PER> from Madam Pomfrey’s view.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> was going to tear the paper.
<PER>Harry</PER> smoothed it out eagerly and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned close to read it, too.
And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Hermione</PER>’s.
“A giant snake Someone would’ve seen ” <PER>Harry</PER>, however, pointed at the word <PER>Hermione</PER> had scribbled at the foot of the page.
“Should we go straight to <PER>McGonagall</PER>?” “Let’s go to the staffroom,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, jumping up.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> paced around it, too excited to sit down.
<PER>Snape</PER> gripped the back of a chair very hard and said, “How can you be sure?” “The Heir of Slytherin,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who was very white, “left another message.
“Which student?” “<PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ron</PER> slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
For one wild moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure it would be <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“She knew something, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staffroom.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see how <PER>Ginny</PER> could still be alive.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, “it’s not nearly as simple as that.
“Shouldn’t have let Professor <PER>Snape</PER> teach us that one,” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk aside.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still pointing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see that <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried over to it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at the snake, willing <PER>Harry</PER> to believe it was alive.
If <PER>Harry</PER> moved <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, the candlelight made it look as though it were moving.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> gasp and looked up again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had made up <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind what <PER>Harry</PER> was going to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that <PER>Ginny</PER> might be alive.
“I’ll just — ” He put He's hand on the door knob, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> both pointed their wands at him.
“Boys, what good will it do?” <PER>Harry</PER> jabbed him in the back with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER> slowly into the pipe, then let go.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood aside as <PER>Ron</PER> came whizzing out of the pipe, too.
“Lumosl” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to Lumosl” <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and it lit again.
<PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand to look at the floor and saw that the floor was littered with small animal bones.
Trying very hard not to imagine what <PER>Ginny</PER> might look like if they found <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — there’s something up there — ” said <PER>Ron</PER> hoarsely, grabbing <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned back to look at the thing, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart beating so fast it hurt.
Very slowly, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes as narrow as <PER>Harry</PER> could make them and still see, <PER>Harry</PER> edged forward, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held high.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped forward, but too late — Lockhart was straightening up, panting, <PER>Ron</PER>’s wand in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and a gleaming smile back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> flung <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor.
“Wait there,” <PER>Harry</PER> called to <PER>Ron</PER>.
And then, at last, as <PER>Harry</PER> crept around yet another bend, <PER>Harry</PER> saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, two entwined serpents's eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.
<PER>Harry</PER> approached, <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat very dry.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to crane <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard’s sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>l” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to <PER>Ginny</PER>l” <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — don’t be dead — please don’t be dead — ” He flung He's wand aside, grabbed <PER>Ginny</PER>’s shoulders, and turned <PER>Ginny</PER>'s over.
But then Her must be — “<PER>Ginny</PER>, please wake up,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered desperately, shaking <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped and spun around on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees.
A tall, black-haired boy was strangely blurred around the edges, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were looking at <PER>Harry</PER> through a misted window.
But there was no mistaking <PER>Harry</PER> — “Tom — Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>?” <PER>Riddle</PER> nodded, not taking his eyes off <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> stood, a weird, misty light shining about Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>, not a day older than sixteen.
“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, raising <PER>Ginny</PER>’s head again.
<PER>Harry</PER>, sweating, managed to hoist <PER>Ginny</PER> half off the floor, and bent to pick up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand again.
<PER>Riddle</PER> was still watching He — twirling <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand between his long fingers.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, stretching out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand for it.
“Listen,” said <PER>Harry</PER> urgently, <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees sagging with <PER>Ginny</PER>’s dead weight.
<PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Ginny</PER> back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer.
“What d’you mean, I won’t be — ?” “I’ve waited a long time for this, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“Haven’t you guessed yet, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” said <PER>Riddle</PER> softly.
“It took a very long time for stupid little <PER>Ginny</PER> to stop trusting <PER>Ginny</PER>'s diary,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“Well, you see, <PER>Ginny</PER> told me all about you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“It was my word against <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after <PER>Hagrid</PER> was expelled,” said <PER>Riddle</PER> carelessly.
He stared numbly at <PER>Riddle</PER>, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder <PER>Harry</PER>’s own parents, and so many others.
“Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!” Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hissed.
<PER>Harry</PER> was speaking at random, wanting to scare <PER>Riddle</PER>, wishing rather than believing it to be true — <PER>Riddle</PER> opened his mouth, but froze.
It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on <PER>Harry</PER>’s scalp and made <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size.
Then, as the music reached such a pitch that <PER>Harry</PER> felt it vibrating inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.
The bird sat still and warm next to <PER>Harry</PER>’s cheek, gazing steadily at <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“Fawkes?” <PER>Harry</PER> breathed, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the bird’s golden claws squeeze <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder gently.
<PER>Riddle</PER> laughed so hard that the dark Chamber rang with it, as though ten <PER>Riddle</PER>s were laughing at once — “This is what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sends <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s defender!
“To business, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>, still smiling broadly.
<PER>Riddle</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel.
It looked bad, all right but the longer <PER>Riddle</PER> stood there, the more life was dwindling out of <PER>Ginny</PER> and in the meantime, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed suddenly, <PER>Riddle</PER>’s outline was becoming clearer, more solid.
<PER>Harry</PER>, fear spreading up <PER>Harry</PER>'s numb legs, watched <PER>Riddle</PER> stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness.
<PER>Riddle</PER> opened his mouth wide and hissed — but <PER>Harry</PER> understood what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying .
“ Speak to me, Slytherin , greatest of the Hogwarts Four.” <PER>Harry</PER> wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
Horrorstruck, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.
<PER>Harry</PER> backed away until <PER>Harry</PER> hit the dark Chamber wall, and as <PER>Harry</PER> shut <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes tight <PER>Harry</PER> felt Fawkes’ wing sweep <PER>Harry</PER>'s cheek as <PER>Harry</PER> took flight.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt it shudder <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was happening, <PER>Harry</PER> could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin’s mouth.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Riddle</PER>’s hissing voice: “Kill him.” The basilisk was moving toward <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> could hear The basilisk heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor.
Eyes still tightly shut, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> began to run blindly sideways, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands outstretched, feeling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s way — <PER>Voldemort</PER> was laughing <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> tripped.
— <PER>Voldemort</PER> fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood — the serpent was barely feet from — <PER>Voldemort</PER>, — <PER>Voldemort</PER> could hear the serpent coming — There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> so hard that <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was smashed into the wall.
Waiting for fangs to sink through <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s body <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars — <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help it — <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on.
As <PER>Harry</PER> trembled, ready to close <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes if it turned, <PER>Harry</PER> saw what had distracted the snake.
The snake’s tail thrashed, narrowly missing <PER>Harry</PER>, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could shut <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, it turned — <PER>Harry</PER> looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.
“NO!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Riddle</PER> screaming.
Help me — help me — <PER>Harry</PER> thought, — <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes screwed tight under the hat.
Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head, almost knocking <PER>Harry</PER> out.
Stars winking in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised the sword in both <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands — The basilisk lunged again, and this time The basilisk aim was true — <PER>Harry</PER> threw — <PER>Harry</PER>'s whole weight behind the sword and drove the sword to the hilt into the roof of the serpent’s mouth — But as warm blood drenched — <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms, — <PER>Harry</PER> felt a searing pain just above — <PER>Harry</PER>'s elbow.
<PER>Harry</PER> gripped the fang that was spreading poison through <PER>Harry</PER>'s body and wrenched ] body out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
A patch of scarlet swam past, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard a soft clatter of claws beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’re dead, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>’s voice above him.
“So ends the famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>’s distant voice.
“Get away from he — I said, get away — ” <PER>Harry</PER> raised ” <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Riddle</PER> was pointing <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.
“Phoenix tears ” said <PER>Riddle</PER> quietly, staring at <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
“Of course healing powers I forgot <PER>Harry</PER> looked into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
For a split second, both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Riddle</PER>, wand still raised, stared at it.
Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, <PER>Harry</PER> seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to <PER>Harry</PER> and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.
<PER>Riddle</PER> was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then — <PER>Riddle</PER> had gone.
Shaking all over, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> up.
Slowly, <PER>Harry</PER> gathered together <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk’s mouth.
her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over <PER>Harry</PER>, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — oh, <PER>Harry</PER> — I tried to tell you at b- breakfast, but I c -couldn’t say it in front of Percy — it was me, <PER>Harry</PER> — but I — I s-swear I d-didn’t mean to — R-<PER>Riddle</PER> made me, R-<PER>Riddle</PER> t-took me over — and — how did you kill that — that thing?
<PER>Harry</PER> urged <PER>Ginny</PER> forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, speeding up.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>” <PER>Ron</PER> thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull <PER>Ginny</PER>” <PER>Ron</PER>'s through first.
“He’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, squeezing through <PER>Harry</PER>.
“How come you’ve got a sword?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, gaping at the glittering weapon in <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
“I’ll explain when we get out of here,” said <PER>Harry</PER> with a sideways glance at <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was crying harder than ever.
He didn’t think it was a good idea to tell <PER>Ron</PER> yet who’d been opening the Chamber, not in front of <PER>Ginny</PER>, anyway.
“Have you thought how we’re going to get back up this?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past <PER>Harry</PER> and was now fluttering in front of Fawkes, Fawkes's beady eyes bright in the dark.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked uncertainly at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“But you’re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there — ” “Fawkes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “isn’t an ordinary bird.” <PER>Harry</PER> turned quickly to the others.
“You hold <PER>Ginny</PER>’s other hand — ” <PER>Harry</PER> tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, <PER>Ron</PER> took hold of the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes, and <PER>Harry</PER> reached out and took hold of Fawkes’s strangely hot tail feathers.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear Lockhart dangling below <PER>Harry</PER>, saying, “Amazing!
“Where now?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, with an anxious look at <PER>Ginny</PER>.
For a moment there was silence as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in <PER>Harry</PER>’s case) blood.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest.
Fawkes went whooshing past <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear and settled on Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s shoulder, just as <PER>Harry</PER> found himself and <PER>Ron</PER> being swept into Molly’s tight embrace.
Molly let go of <PER>Harry</PER>, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted sword, and what remained of <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary.
For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: he told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how <PER>Hermione</PER> had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and <PER>Ron</PER> had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom.
“Very well,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> prompted him as he paused, “so you found out where the entrance was — breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add — but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?” So <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice about Fawkes’s timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword.
him had so far avoided mentioning <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary — or <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Instinctively, <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.
“What interests me most,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gently, “is how Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> managed to enchant <PER>Ginny</PER>, when my sources tell me Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.” Relief — warm, sweeping, glorious relief — swept over <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Riddle</PER> wrote it when “<PER>Riddle</PER> was sixteen.
“Very few people know that Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> was once called Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“What’s our <PER>Ginny</PER> got to do with — with — him?” “His d-diary!” <PER>Ginny</PER> sobbed.
“There has been no lasting harm done, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“You know, Minerva,” Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said thoughtfully to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “I think all this merits a good feast Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?” “Right,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> crisply, also moving to the door.
She left, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> gazed uncertainly at Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s vague smile.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> addressed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Lockhart looked over Lockhart's shoulder to see who Lockhart was talking to.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> said quickly, “there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets.
“He’ll lend you one.” “Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> cast a curious look back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> as he closed the door.
“Sit down, <PER>Harry</PER>,” he said, and <PER>Harry</PER> sat, feeling unaccountably nervous.
“First of all, <PER>Harry</PER>, I want to thank you,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, eyes twinkling again.
<PER>Harry</PER> grinned awkwardly as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And so you met Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thoughtfully.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Riddle</PER> said I’m like Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“And what do you think, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “I don’t think I’m like him!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, more loudly than <PER>Harry</PER>’d intended.
“It certainly seems so.” “So I should be in Slytherin,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking desperately into <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face.
“If you want proof, <PER>Harry</PER>, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reached across to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed the blood-stained silver sword to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> simply.
Then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pulled open one of the drawers in Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink.
Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> stood there, fury in Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s face.
Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> almost knocked <PER>Harry</PER> over as <PER>Harry</PER> swept into the room.
Dobby went scurrying in after <PER>Harry</PER>, crouching at the hem of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak, a look of abject terror on his face.
His great eyes fixed meaningfully on <PER>Harry</PER>, His kept pointing at the diary, then at Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and then hitting His hard on the head with His's fist.
“I see ” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> slowly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“A clever plan,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in a level voice, still staring Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> straight in the eye.
“Because if <PER>Harry</PER> here” — Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> shot <PER>Harry</PER> a swift, sharp look — “and his friend <PER>Ron</PER> hadn’t discovered this book, why — <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley might have taken all the blame.
<PER>Harry</PER> nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears in punishment.
“Don’t you want to know how <PER>Ginny</PER> got hold of that diary, Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then it came to <PER>Harry</PER> — “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” he said hurriedly.
“Can I give that diary back to Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, please?” “Certainly, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, <PER>Harry</PER> took off one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoes, pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into the diary.
“Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, skidding to a halt, “I’ve got something for you — ” And <PER>Harry</PER> forced the smelly sock into Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hand.
“What the — ?” Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> ripped the sock off the diary, threw the smelly sock into Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hand aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!” But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” There was a loud bang, and Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> was thrown backward.
Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> got up, Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s face livid, and pulled out Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing up at <PER>Harry</PER>, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter set Dobby free!” “Least I could do, Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as Dobby pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>’s sock with shaking hands.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter sobbed.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know whether the best bit was <PER>Hermione</PER> running toward <PER>Harry</PER>, screaming “You solved it!
Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences — Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (“but we’ve had plenty of practice at that anyway,” <PER>Ron</PER> told a disgruntled <PER>Hermione</PER>) and Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been sacked as a school governor.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was no longer strutting around the school as though <PER>Malfoy</PER> owned the place.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> got a compartment to themselves.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — what did you see Percy doing, that Percy didn’t want you to tell anyone?” “Oh, that,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, giggling.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill and a bit of parchment and turned to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
For another, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter really wanted to do <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved the tip of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as <PER>Harry</PER> looked for something that would help <PER>Harry</PER> write <PER>Harry</PER>'s essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.” The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph.
<PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s round glasses up the bridge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose, moved <PER>Harry</PER>'s flashlight closer to the book, and read: Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill between <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment.
The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that <PER>Harry</PER> never enjoyed <PER>Harry</PER>'s summer holidays.
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, <PER>Dudley</PER>, were <PER>Harry</PER>’s only living relatives.
For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon kept <PER>Harry</PER> as downtrodden as possible, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon would be able to squash the magic out of <PER>Harry</PER>.
The most they could do, however, was to lock away <PER>Harry</PER>’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid <PER>Harry</PER> to talk to the neighbors.
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Harry</PER>'s teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work.
One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for <PER>Harry</PER>’s least favorite teacher, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, who would be delighted to have an excuse to give <PER>Harry</PER> detention for a month.
<PER>Harry</PER> had therefore seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s chance in the first week of the holidays.
While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and <PER>Dudley</PER> had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street would notice it too), <PER>Harry</PER> had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s books, and hidden some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s books in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> was particularly keen to avoid trouble with <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with <PER>Harry</PER>, all because he’d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation.
<PER>Ron</PER> Weasley, who was one of <PER>Harry</PER>’s best friends at Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards.
“Vernon Dursley speaking.” <PER>Harry</PER>, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice answer.
<PER>Ron</PER> obviously realized that he’d gotten <PER>Harry</PER> into trouble, because <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t called again.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s other best friend from Hogwarts, <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger, hadn’t been in touch either.
<PER>Harry</PER> suspected that <PER>Ron</PER> had warned <PER>Hermione</PER> not to call, which was a pity, because <PER>Hermione</PER>, the cleverest witch in <PER>Harry</PER>’s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.
So <PER>Harry</PER> had had no word from any of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wizarding friends for five long weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one.
Yet another unusual thing about <PER>Harry</PER> was how little <PER>Harry</PER> looked forward to <PER>Harry</PER>'s birthdays.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never received a birthday card in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face after a long time under the blankets.
<PER>Harry</PER>, though still rather small and skinny for <PER>Harry</PER>'s age, had grown a few inches over the last year.
<PER>Harry</PER> jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had been — stubbornly untidy, whatever <PER>Harry</PER> did to it.
The eyes behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses were bright green, and on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead, clearly visible through <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.
<PER>Harry</PER> had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead, where <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator.
But <PER>Harry</PER> had come face-to-face with <PER>Harry</PER> at Hogwarts.
Remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window, <PER>Harry</PER> had to admit <PER>Harry</PER> was lucky even to have reached <PER>Harry</PER>'s thirteenth birthday.
<PER>Harry</PER> scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring back to <PER>Harry</PER> with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise.
Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before <PER>Harry</PER> realized what <PER>Harry</PER> was seeing.
For a split second <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand on the window latch, wondering whether to slam it shut.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized the unconscious owl at once — <PER>Harry</PER>'s name was Errol, and <PER>Harry</PER> belonged to the Weasley family.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and grabbed Errol’s package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s first ever birthday card.
<PER>Harry</PER> scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across <PER>Harry</PER>'s face as <PER>Harry</PER> saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of a large pyramid.
Right in the middle of the picture was <PER>Ron</PER>, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up <PER>Ron</PER>’s letter and unfolded it.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered only too well the occasion when <PER>Ron</PER>’s old wand had snapped.
<PER>Harry</PER> now turned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s present and unwrapped it.
Bye — <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> put the Pocket Sneakoscope on Bye — <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his clock.
Dear <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon.
<PER>Harry</PER> laughed as <PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s letter aside and picked up her present.
“Wow, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.
<PER>Harry</PER> happened to be a very good Quidditch player; <PER>Harry</PER> had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams.
<PER>Harry</PER> put the leather case aside and picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s last parcel.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the Hogwarts gamekeeper.
<PER>Harry</PER> tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could unwrap it properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside the parcel snapped loudly — as though the parcel had jaws.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hagrid</PER> would never send <PER>Harry</PER> anything dangerous on purpose, but then, <PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t have a normal person’s view of what was dangerous.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached for the lamp on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, ready to strike.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> seized the rest of the wrapping paper in <PER>Harry</PER>'s other hand and pulled.
Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, <PER>Harry</PER> got down on <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and knees and reached toward it.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled around, threw <PER>Harry</PER> forward, and managed to flatten it.
Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as <PER>Harry</PER> clamped the struggling book tightly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms, hurried to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it.
The Monster Book shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so <PER>Harry</PER> threw The Monster Book down on the bed and reached for <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s card.
All the best, <PER>Hagrid</PER> It struck <PER>Harry</PER> as ominous that <PER>Hagrid</PER> thought a biting book would come in useful, but he put <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s card up next to <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, grinning more broadly than ever.
Yours sincerely, Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> Deputy Headmistress <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at the Hogsmeade permission form, no longer grinning.
It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> Deputy Headmistress <PER>Harry</PER> knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> Deputy Headmistress <PER>Harry</PER> had never set foot there.
But how on earth was Professor M. <PER>McGonagall</PER> Deputy Headmistress <PER>Harry</PER> going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form?
Deciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, <PER>Harry</PER> got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart <PER>Harry</PER>’d made for <PER>Harry</PER>, counting down the days left until <PER>Harry</PER>'s return to Hogwarts.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> took off <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing <PER>Harry</PER>'s three birthday cards.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down between <PER>Dudley</PER> and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache.
Far from wishing <PER>Harry</PER> a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed <PER>Harry</PER> enter the room, but <PER>Harry</PER> was far too used to this to care.
<PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict: " The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous.
At <PER>Dudley</PER>’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked <PER>Harry</PER> around the shins with Aunt Marge's walking stick to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from beating <PER>Dudley</PER> at musical statues.
A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for <PER>Dudley</PER> and a box of dog biscuits for <PER>Harry</PER>.
On her last visit, the year before <PER>Harry</PER> started at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER> had accidentally trodden on the tail of shis favorite dog.
Ripper had chased <PER>Harry</PER> out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call <PER>Harry</PER> off until past midnight.
“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “and while we’re on the subject” — he pointed a fat finger threateningly at <PER>Harry</PER> — “we need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her.” <PER>Dudley</PER> smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television.
Watching <PER>Harry</PER> being bullied by Uncle Vernon was <PER>Dudley</PER>’s favorite form of entertainment.
“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.” “All right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly, “if she does when she’s talking to me.” “Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard <PER>Harry</PER>’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any — any funny stuff while she’s here.
“Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, choosing <PER>Harry</PER>'s words carefully, “it’ll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits — ” “St.
But <PER>Harry</PER> stood <PER>Harry</PER>'s ground.
“But if you sign my permission form,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal and everything.” <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if Uncle Vernon's teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in Uncle Vernon's temple.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back upstairs to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see the point of trying to make <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair lie flat.
Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach, knocking the wind out of <PER>Harry</PER>, seized <PER>Dudley</PER> in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on <PER>Harry</PER>'s cheek.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well that <PER>Dudley</PER> only put up with Aunt Marge’s hugs because <PER>Harry</PER> was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, <PER>Dudley</PER> had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.
But <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by <PER>Harry</PER>, so <PER>Harry</PER> began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged <PER>Harry</PER> to stay out of their way, which <PER>Harry</PER> was only too happy to do.
Aunt Marge, on the other hand, wanted <PER>Harry</PER> under Aunt Marge's eye at all times, so that Aunt Marge could boom out suggestions for <PER>Harry</PER>'s improvement.
Aunt Marge delighted in comparing <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Dudley</PER>, and took huge pleasure in buying <PER>Dudley</PER> expensive presents while glaring at <PER>Harry</PER>, as though daring <PER>Harry</PER> to ask why <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t got a present too.
“If there’s something rotten on the inside, there’s nothing anyone can do about it.” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to concentrate on <PER>Harry</PER>'s food, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands shook and <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was starting to burn with anger.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still an underage wizard, and <PER>Harry</PER> was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school.
<PER>Harry</PER> got through the next three days by forcing <PER>Harry</PER> to think about <PER>Harry</PER>'s Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him.
<PER>Harry</PER> really wanted to disappear into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom, but <PER>Harry</PER> met Uncle Vernon’s angry little eyes and knew <PER>Harry</PER> would have to sit it out.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never felt so angry in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> tore from the dining room before anyone could stop <PER>Harry</PER>, heading for the cupboard under the stairs.
“I’ve had enough.” And in the next moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving <PER>Harry</PER>'s heavy trunk behind <PER>Harry</PER>, Hedwig’s cage under <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> was several streets away before <PER>Harry</PER> collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat quite still, anger still surging through <PER>Harry</PER>, listening to the frantic thumping of <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart.
Would <PER>Harry</PER> be arrested, or would <PER>Harry</PER> simply be outlawed from the wizarding world?
Would <PER>Harry</PER> thought of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and his heart sank even lower.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure that, criminal or not, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would want to help <PER>Harry</PER> now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, <PER>Harry</PER> had no means of contacting them.
There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk, but the rest of the fortune <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents had left <PER>Harry</PER> was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak — but before <PER>Harry</PER> had found it, <PER>Harry</PER> straightened up suddenly, looking around <PER>Harry</PER> once more.
A funny prickling on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck had made <PER>Harry</PER> feel <PER>Harry</PER> was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent over <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand clenched on <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Lumos,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, and a light appeared at the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, almost dazzling <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> held it high over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them <PER>Harry</PER> saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> legs hit <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and <PER>Harry</PER> tripped.
His wand flew out of His's hand as His flung out an arm to break His's fall, and His landed, hard, in the gutter — There was a deafening BANG, and <PER>Harry</PER> threw up <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands to shield <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes against a sudden blinding light — With a yell, His rolled back onto the pavement, just in time.
They belonged, as <PER>Harry</PER> saw when <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air.
For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> wondered if <PER>Harry</PER> had been knocked silly by <PER>Harry</PER>'s fall.
<PER>Harry</PER> snatched up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand again and scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
Close up, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than <PER>Harry</PER> was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples.
One of the knees in <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans was torn, and the hand <PER>Harry</PER> had thrown out to break <PER>Harry</PER>'s fall was bleeding.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly remembered why <PER>Harry</PER> had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence.
“Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, flattening <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair over <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar.
“<PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, saying the first name that came into <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“Listen, how much would it be to get to London?” “Eleven Sickles,” said Stan, “but for firteen you get ’ot chocolate, and for fifteen you get an ’ot water bottle an’ a toofbrush in the color of your choice.” <PER>Harry</PER> rummaged once more in <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk, extracted <PER>Harry</PER>'s money bag, and shoved some gold into Stan’s hand.
There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have been able to sleep even if <PER>Harry</PER> had been traveling on a bus that didn’t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time.
<PER>Harry</PER> stomach churned as <PER>Harry</PER> fell back to wondering what was going to happen to <PER>Harry</PER>, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet.
“That man!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, forgetting <PER>Harry</PER>'s troubles for a moment.
“ ’Course ’e was on the Muggle news, <PER>Neville</PER>, where you been?” He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, removed the front page, and handed the front page to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You oughta read the papers more, <PER>Neville</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> held the paper up to the candlelight and read: BLACK STILL AT LARGE Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never met a vampire, but <PER>Harry</PER> had seen pictures of them in <PER>Harry</PER>'s Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.
“<PER>Harry</PER> murdered thirteen people?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, handing the page back to Stan, “with one curse?” “Yep,” said Stan, “in front of witnesses an’ all.
“What, <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, without thinking.
“ ’<PER>Cho</PER>o say ’is name for?” “Sorry,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily.
“Blimey, my ’eart’s goin’ that fast” “So — so Black was a supporter of <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> prompted apologetically.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t soon forget the look of terror on <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face when <PER>Harry</PER> had been told where <PER>Harry</PER> was going, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was one of the bravest people <PER>Harry</PER> knew.
The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and <PER>Harry</PER> lay, restless and miserable, on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feather bed.
After a while, Stan remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over <PER>Harry</PER>’s pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen.
“Right then, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said Stan, clapping his hands, “whereabouts in London?” “Diagon Alley,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and Hedwig’s cage onto the pavement.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> could turn, <PER>Harry</PER> felt a hand on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
“ ’Ow come you di’n’t tell us ’oo you are, eh, <PER>Neville</PER>?” said Stan, beaming at <PER>Harry</PER>, while Ernie’s owlish face peered interestedly over Stan’s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms despite the glow of the fire.
“I am <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I won’t deny that they are extremely angry, <PER>Harry</PER>, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.” <PER>Harry</PER> unstuck <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to <PER>Harry</PER> now.
“Now, have a crumpet, <PER>Harry</PER>, while I go and see if Tom’s got a room for you.” Fudge strode out of the parlor and <PER>Harry</PER> stared after him.
“No, no, I’m very sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>, but as I’m not your parent or guardian — ” “But you’re the Minister of Magic,” said <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe that <PER>Harry</PER>’d left Privet Drive only a few hours ago, that <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t expelled, and that <PER>Harry</PER> was now facing three Dursley-free weeks.
It took <PER>Harry</PER> several days to get used to <PER>Harry</PER>'s strange new freedom.
Never before had <PER>Harry</PER> been able to get up whenever <PER>Harry</PER> wanted or eat whatever <PER>Harry</PER> fancied.
<PER>Harry</PER> could even go wherever <PER>Harry</PER> pleased, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world, <PER>Harry</PER> felt no desire to break <PER>Harry</PER>'s word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.
<PER>Harry</PER> ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where <PER>Harry</PER> liked watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day’s shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast <PER>Harry</PER> would go out into the backyard, take out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where <PER>Harry</PER>'s fellow diners were showing one another fellow diners's purchases (“it’s a lunascope, old boy — no more messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (“personally, I won’t let any of the children out alone until he’s back in Azkaban”).
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have to do <PER>Harry</PER>'s homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now <PER>Harry</PER> could sit in the bright sunshine outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all <PER>Harry</PER>'s essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave <PER>Harry</PER> free sundaes every half an hour.
Once <PER>Harry</PER> had refilled <PER>Harry</PER>'s money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from <PER>Harry</PER>'s vault at Gringotts, <PER>Harry</PER> had to exercise a lot of self- control not to spend the whole lot at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to keep reminding <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player’s face when they lose a point).
<PER>Harry</PER> was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant <PER>Harry</PER> never had to take another Astronomy lesson.
But the thing that tested <PER>Harry</PER>’s resolution most appeared in <PER>Harry</PER>'s favorite shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he’d arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.
Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, <PER>Harry</PER> edged <PER>Harry</PER>'s way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most magnificent broom <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never wanted anything as much in <PER>Harry</PER>'s whole life — but <PER>Harry</PER> had never lost a Quidditch match on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when his had a very good broom already?
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t ask for the price, but <PER>Harry</PER> returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to the Apothecary to replenish <PER>Harry</PER>'s store of potions ingredients, and as He's school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, <PER>Harry</PER> visited Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones.
Most important of all, <PER>Harry</PER> had to buy <PER>Harry</PER>'s new schoolbooks, which would include those for <PER>Harry</PER>'s two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination.
<PER>Harry</PER> got a surprise as <PER>Harry</PER> looked in at the bookshop window.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s booklist out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and consulted it for the first time.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> understood why <PER>Hagrid</PER> had said it would come in useful.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt relieved; <PER>Harry</PER> had been wondering whether <PER>Hagrid</PER> wanted help with some terrifying new pet.
“Come to get your new books?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I need — ” “Get out of the way,” said the manager impatiently, brushing <PER>Harry</PER> aside.
“Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, tearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes away from the dog’s and dazedly consulting <PER>Harry</PER>'s booklist.
“Er — I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three.” <PER>Harry</PER> emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with <PER>Harry</PER>'s new books under <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing where his was going and bumping into several people.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind <PER>Harry</PER> and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER> in the mirror over the basin.
As the days slipped by, <PER>Harry</PER> started looking wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went for a sign of <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the real <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t stop to chat; <PER>Neville</PER> appeared to have mislaid <PER>Harry</PER>'s booklist and was being told off by <PER>Harry</PER>'s very formidable-looking grandmother.
<PER>Harry</PER> hoped she never found out that <PER>Harry</PER>’d pretended to be <PER>Neville</PER> while on the run from the Ministry of Magic.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that <PER>Harry</PER> would at least meet <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where He’d have lunch, when someone yelled <PER>Harry</PER>'s name and <PER>Harry</PER> turned.
“Finally!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> as he sat down.
“Did you really blow up your aunt, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a very serious voice.
“I didn’t mean to,” said <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Ron</PER> roared with laughter.
“I just — lost control.” “It’s not funny, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply.
“Honestly, I’m amazed <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t expelled.” “So am I,” admitted <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies — ” “What are you doing Muggle Studies for?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, rolling his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, while <PER>Ron</PER> sniggered.
“You could see if they’ve got anything for Scabbers, and <PER>Hermione</PER> can get <PER>Hermione</PER>'s owl.” So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie.
The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> waited, examining the cages.
Like nearly everything <PER>Ron</PER> owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to <PER>Ron</PER>’s brother Percy) and a bit battered.
“Scabbers!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, racing out of the shop after him; <PER>Harry</PER> followed.
As They reached it, <PER>Hermione</PER> came out, but <PER>Hermione</PER> wasn’t carrying an owl.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, that thing nearly scalped me!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“How are you?” “Fine, thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined Arthur with all their shopping.
Arthur put down Arthur's paper, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, who had always been very taken with <PER>Harry</PER>, seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw <PER>Harry</PER>, perhaps because <PER>Harry</PER> had saved shis life during their previous year at Hogwarts.
Percy, however, held out Percy's hand solemnly as though Percy and <PER>Harry</PER> had never met and said, “<PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>’s got other brothers to set <PER>Ginny</PER>'s an example, Mother,” said Percy loftily.
Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> ate <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s way through five delicious courses.
“Well, as we haven’t got one anymore,” said Mister Weasley, “ — and as I work there, they’re doing me a favor — ” His voice was casual, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help noticing that Arthur’s ears had gone red, just like <PER>Ron</PER>’s did when <PER>Ron</PER>’s was under pressure.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Percy were next door to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Percy had just closed and locked <PER>Ron</PER> and Percy's own trunk when <PER>Ron</PER> and Percy heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what was going on.
“I’ll get Scabbers’s stuff, I’m packed,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> went downstairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when <PER>Harry</PER> heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, not wanting them to know He’d heard them arguing, when the sound of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own name made <PER>Harry</PER> stop, then move closer to the parlor door.
“Do you really want to send <PER>Harry</PER> back to school with that hanging over <PER>Harry</PER>?
“You know what <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> are like, wandering off by themselves — themselves’ve even ended up in the Forbidden Forest!
<PER>Harry</PER> waited until <PER>Harry</PER> heard Mister and Molly’s bedroom door close, then headed back upstairs with The bottle of rat tonic.
<PER>Harry</PER> forced a laugh, went to give <PER>Ron</PER> the rat tonic, then shut <PER>Harry</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>'s room and lay down on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
He’d made <PER>Harry</PER> promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on <PER>Harry</PER>.
And <PER>Harry</PER> was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after <PER>Harry</PER> until <PER>Harry</PER> was on the train.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel more scared.
Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mister and Molly obviously thought <PER>Harry</PER> would be panic-stricken if <PER>Harry</PER> knew the truth.
But <PER>Harry</PER> happened to agree wholeheartedly with Molly that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> happened to be.
Didn’t people always say that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was the only person Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had ever been afraid of?
No, all in all, the thing that bothered <PER>Harry</PER> most was the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>'s chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero.
Nobody would want <PER>Harry</PER> to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact, <PER>Harry</PER> suspected <PER>Harry</PER>'s every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed.
Tom woke <PER>Harry</PER> the next morning with <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual toothless grin and a cup of tea.
<PER>Harry</PER> got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into Hedwig's cage when <PER>Ron</PER> banged his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.
They headed down to breakfast, where Arthur was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Molly was telling <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> about a love potion she’d made as a young girl.
“What were you saying?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> as they sat down.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no chance to speak to <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> in the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron’s narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and Hermes, Percy’s screech owl, perched on top in their cages.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come on.” Arthur marched <PER>Harry</PER> across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two old-fashioned dark green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive- looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.
<PER>Harry</PER> got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and, to <PER>Ron</PER>’s disgust, Percy.
Percy and <PER>Ginny</PER> suddenly appeared behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye, and they both turned away to hide they both's laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with Percy's chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his shiny badge.
Once the remaining Weasleys and <PER>Hermione</PER> had joined them, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> led the way to the end of the train, past packed compartments, to a carriage that looked quite empty.
Molly kissed all her children, then <PER>Hermione</PER>, and finally, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Do take care, won’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
“I’m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius Black can’t be worse than <PER>Voldemort</PER>, can <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” Arthur flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, swear to me you won’t go looking for Black.” <PER>Harry</PER> stared.
“Promise me, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Arthur, talking more quickly still, “that whatever happens — ” “Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me?” said <PER>Harry</PER> blankly.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran to the compartment door and <PER>Ron</PER> threw the compartment door open and stood back to let <PER>Harry</PER> on.
“I need to talk to you in private,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as the train picked up speed.
“Go away, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Oh, that’s nice,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> huffily, and <PER>Ginny</PER> stalked off.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off down the corridor, looking for an empty compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> checked on the threshold.
When he’d finished, <PER>Ron</PER> looked thunderstruck, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands over her mouth.
“Trouble usually finds me.” “How thick would <PER>Harry</PER> have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?” said <PER>Ron</PER> shakily.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was.
“It’s coming from your trunk, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, standing up and reaching into the luggage rack.
“It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol’s leg to send it to <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrewdly.
“In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack’s supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain — ” “ — and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you’re sucking them,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was plainly not listening to a word <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ — or we can ask Fred and George, they know every secret passage out of the castle — ” “<PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply.
“I don’t think <PER>Harry</PER> should be sneaking out of school with Black on the loose — ” “Yeah, I expect that’s what <PER>McGonagall</PER> will say when I ask for permission,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
“But if we’re with him,” said <PER>Ron</PER> spiritedly to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Black wouldn’t dare — ” “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, don’t talk rubbish,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Don’t let that thing out!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, but too late; Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched, yawned, and sprang onto <PER>Ron</PER>’s knees; the lump in <PER>Ron</PER>’s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks angrily away.
“Get out of here!” “<PER>Ron</PER>, don’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily.
Crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat, his squashed face turned toward <PER>Ron</PER>, his yellow eyes on <PER>Ron</PER>’s top pocket.
“I mean — — hasn’t died, has he?” “No, no, —’s breathing,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, taking the Cauldron Cake <PER>Harry</PER> passed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the window, they heard footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least favorite people appeared at the door: <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had been enemies ever since <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had met on <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s very first train journey to Hogwarts.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, who had a pale, pointed, sneering face, was in Slytherin House; he played Seeker on the Slytherin Quidditch team, the same position that <PER>Harry</PER> played on the Gryffindor team.
“Well, look who it is,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> in <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door.
“New teacher,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold <PER>Ron</PER> back.
“What were you saying, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s pale eyes narrowed; <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down again, <PER>Ron</PER> massaging <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>'s knuckles.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” hissed <PER>Hermione</PER>, pointing at Professor Lupin, “be careful ” But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.
“What’s going on?” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice from behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, that was my foot!” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s way back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
“D’you think we’ve broken down?” “Dunno ” There was a squeaking sound, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw the dim black outline of <PER>Ron</PER>, wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt her pass <PER>Harry</PER>, heard the door slide open again, and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.
“Who’s that?” “Who’s that?” “<PER>Ginny</PER>?” “<PER>Hermione</PER>?” “What are you doing?” “I was looking for <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “Come in and sit down — ” “Not here!” said <PER>Harry</PER> hurriedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear movements in <PER>Harry</PER>'s corner.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes darted downward, and what <PER>Harry</PER>’s saw made <PER>Harry</PER>’s's stomach contract.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s own breath catch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes rolled up into <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“W — what?” <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes; there were lanterns above <PER>Harry</PER>, and the floor was shaking — the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come back on.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were kneeling next to He, and above them He could see <PER>Neville</PER> and Professor Lupin watching.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt very sick; when <PER>Harry</PER> put up <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to push <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses back on, <PER>Harry</PER> felt cold sweat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> heaved him back onto his seat.
<PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>, both very pale.
“Here,” he said to <PER>Harry</PER>, handing <PER>Harry</PER> a particularly large piece.
“Are you sure you’re okay, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, watching <PER>Harry</PER> anxiously.
“No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking anxiously at <PER>Harry</PER> again.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t ask how Professor Lupin knew Professor Lupin's name.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned and saw the gigantic outline of <PER>Hagrid</PER> at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, <PER>Harry</PER> could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept looking at <PER>Harry</PER> sideways, as though frightened <PER>Harry</PER> might collapse again.
A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf <PER>Harry</PER> again; <PER>Harry</PER> leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes until they had passed the gates.
At last, The carriage swayed to a halt, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> got out.
As <PER>Harry</PER> stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear.
“Shove off, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose jaw was clenched.
<PER>Hermione</PER> prodded <PER>Ron</PER> in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors.
<PER>Harry</PER> fought <PER>Harry</PER>'s way over to Shis with a feeling of foreboding: Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had a way of making Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> feel Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> must have done something wrong.
“Move along there, Weasley.” <PER>Ron</PER> stared as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> ushered <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor.
Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> motioned <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to sit down.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> going red in the face.
The thought of what <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> would say if <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had to go to the hospital wing was torture.
He had to wait only a few minutes; then <PER>Hermione</PER> emerged looking very happy about something, followed by Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and the three of them made them's way back down the marble staircase to the Great Hall.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> strode off toward Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s empty seat at the staff table, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gryffindor table.
He and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on either side of <PER>Ron</PER>, who had saved them seats.
<PER>Harry</PER> started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak, and <PER>Harry</PER> broke off.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was often described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn’t why <PER>Harry</PER> respected <PER>Harry</PER>.
You couldn’t help trusting Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and as <PER>Harry</PER> watched him beaming around at the students, him felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> paused again; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.
“Look at <PER>Snape</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
It was common knowledge that <PER>Snape</PER> wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even <PER>Harry</PER>, who hated <PER>Snape</PER>, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that expression only too well; it was the look <PER>Snape</PER> wore every time <PER>Harry</PER> set eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward to see <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was ruby-red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard.
“Who else would have assigned us a biting book?” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> started speaking again, they saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.
<PER>Harry</PER>, suddenly ravenous, helped <PER>Harry</PER> to everything <PER>Harry</PER> could reach and began to eat.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
It had been <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> who had cleared <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s name last year.
“Congratulations, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> squealed as they reached the teachers’ table.
<PER>Harry</PER> climbed the spiral stair with no thought in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head except how glad <PER>Harry</PER> was to be back.
They reached They's familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster beds, and <PER>Harry</PER>, looking around, felt <PER>Harry</PER> was home at last.
When <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story.
“Ignore him,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was right behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What’s up with you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “<PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sitting down on George’s other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.
“Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?” The only time <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> had faced each other in a Quidditch match, <PER>Malfoy</PER> had definitely come off worse.
Feeling slightly more cheerful, <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to sausages and fried tomatoes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was examining <PER>Hermione</PER>'s new schedule.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, “they’ve messed up your schedule.
“But — ” “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, what’s it to you if my schedule’s a bit full?” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped.
“I told you, I’ve fixed it all with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.” Just then, <PER>Hagrid</PER> entered the Great Hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> was used to the subjects of Hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit one another, but <PER>Harry</PER> always enjoyed watching it.
“Aha!” he yelled, seeing <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Puffing loudly, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed the tightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew them had reached the classroom.
There were no doors off this landing, but <PER>Ron</PER> nudged <PER>Harry</PER> and pointed at the ceiling, where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.
“After you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning, so <PER>Harry</PER> climbed the ladder first.
<PER>Harry</PER> emerged into the strangest-looking classroom <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen.
<PER>Ron</PER> appeared at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> around the same round table.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to pull <PER>Harry</PER> together.
“My turn ” <PER>Ron</PER> peered into <PER>Harry</PER>’s teacup, his forehead wrinkled with effort.
“Let me see that, my dear,” she said reprovingly to <PER>Ron</PER>, sweeping over and snatching <PER>Harry</PER>’s cup from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Everybody knows about <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration.
Everyone had got to Everyone's feet, and slowly they crowded around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s table, pressing close to Professor Trelawney’s chair to get a good look at <PER>Harry</PER>’s cup.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t the only one who didn’t understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at Dean Thomas and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped Dean Thomas shrugged at Dean Thomas and Lavender Brown's hands to Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown's mouths in horror.
Everyone was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, everyone except <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor Trelawney’s chair.
“When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going to die or not!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, taking even <PER>Harry</PER> by surprise.
Even <PER>Ron</PER> was avoiding <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though <PER>Harry</PER> were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at <PER>Harry</PER>, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were about to drop dead at any moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> hardly heard what Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was telling them about Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and wasn’t even watching when Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> transformed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> in front of them's eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyes.
“Really, what has got into you all today?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning back into Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> with a faint pop, and staring around at them all.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
“I see,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, fixing <PER>Harry</PER> with her beady eyes.
<PER>Ron</PER> still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, “But what about <PER>Neville</PER>’s cup?” When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, cheer up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, pushing a dish of stew toward him.
“You heard what Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said.” <PER>Ron</PER> spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn’t start.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, in a low, serious voice, “you haven’t seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?” “Yeah, I have,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone mad.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, if <PER>Harry</PER>’s seen a Grim, that’s — that’s bad,” he said.
“My — my uncle Bilius saw one and — and my uncle Bilius died twenty-four hours later!” “Coincidence,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> airily, pouring <PER>Hermione</PER> some pumpkin juice.
“You didn’t seem quite so confident when you were telling <PER>Harry</PER> it was a sheep,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> coolly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> slammed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> weren’t speaking to each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked beside them in silence as them went down the sloping lawns to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
<PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure <PER>Harry</PER> knew what they were talking about.
“That’s it — make sure yeh can see — now, firs’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books — ” “How?” said the cold, drawling voice of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> took out <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, which <PER>Malfoy</PER> had bound shut with a length of rope.
“Look — He took <PER>Hermione</PER>’s copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound <PER>Hermione</PER>’s copy.
“Really witty, giving us books that try and rip us hands off!” “Shut up, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was looking downcast and <PER>Harry</PER> wanted <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s first lesson to be a success.
“That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a fit when I tell him — ” “Shut up, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated.
“Beau’iful, aren’ they?” <PER>Harry</PER> could sort of see what <PER>Hagrid</PER> meant.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, approached the fence cautiously.
Even <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had misgivings.
There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and Parvati whispered, “Oooh, no, <PER>Harry</PER>, remember your tea leaves!” <PER>Harry</PER> ignored them.
“Good man, <PER>Harry</PER>!” roared <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Easy, now, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> quietly.
“Tha’s it, <PER>Harry</PER> now, bow <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel much like exposing the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck to Buckbeak, but <PER>Harry</PER> did as <PER>Harry</PER> was told.
“Right — back away, now, <PER>Harry</PER>, easy does it — ” But then, to <PER>Harry</PER>’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent the hippogriff scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.
“Well done, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, ecstatic.
“Righ’ then, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was used to a broomstick; but <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything in front of <PER>Harry</PER> was covered with feathers.
Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before <PER>Harry</PER> was soaring upward.
It was nothing like a broomstick, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew which one <PER>Harry</PER> preferred; the hippogriff’s wings beat uncomfortably on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>, catching him under <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs and making <PER>Harry</PER> feel <PER>Harry</PER> was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand, <PER>Harry</PER> now felt <PER>Harry</PER> rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.
Buckbeak flew <PER>Harry</PER> once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit <PER>Harry</PER> had been dreading; <PER>Harry</PER> leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling <PER>Harry</PER> was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill- assorted feet hit the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> just managed to hold on and push <PER>Harry</PER> straight again.
“Good work, <PER>Harry</PER>!” roared <PER>Hagrid</PER> as everyone except <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered.
<PER>Neville</PER> ran repeatedly backward from <PER>Neville</PER>, which didn’t seem to want to bend its knees.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> practiced on the chestnut, while <PER>Harry</PER> watched.
“This is very easy,” <PER>Malfoy</PER> drawled, loud enough for <PER>Harry</PER> to hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you, you great ugly brute?” It happened in a flash of steely talons; <PER>Malfoy</PER> let out a high-pitched scream and next moment, <PER>Hagrid</PER> was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as his strained to get at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.
“Someone help me — gotta get him outta here — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> ran to hold open the gate as <PER>Hagrid</PER> lifted <PER>Malfoy</PER> easily.
As they passed, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that there was a long, deep gash on <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s arm; blood splattered the grass and <PER>Hagrid</PER> ran with <PER>Harry</PER>, up the slope toward the castle.
The Slytherins, still muttering about <PER>Hagrid</PER>, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.
“That was a really bad thing to happen in <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s first class, though, wasn’t it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking worried.
“Trust <PER>Malfoy</PER> to mess things up for Trust <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“They wouldn’t fire him, would They?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously, not touching <PER>Hermione</PER>'s steak-and-kidney pudding.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure they were cooking up their own version of how <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been injured.
“There’s a light on in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s window,” <PER>Harry</PER> said suddenly.
When they reached <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, “C’min.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s lap.
“Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a teacher who lasted on’y a day before.” “You haven’t been fired, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But ’s only a matter o’ time, i’n’t it, after <PER>Malfoy</PER> ” “How is he?” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they all sat down.
“It wasn’t serious, was it?” “Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> dully, “but he’s sayin’ it’s still agony covered in bandages moanin’ ” “He’s faking it,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
He grabbed both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.
“I think you’ve had enough to drink, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> firmly.
“Ar, maybe <PER>Hermione</PER>’s right,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, letting go of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> heaved himself out of his chair and followed <PER>Hermione</PER> unsteadily outside.
“What’s he done?” said <PER>Harry</PER> nervously as <PER>Hermione</PER> came back in with the empty tankard.
“Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an’ see me, I really — ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> stopped dead, staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d only just realized <PER>Harry</PER> was there.
He swaggered into the dungeon, He's right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle.
But <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> scowled at each other; Professor <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn’t have said “settle down” if they’d walked in late, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’d have given they detention.
But <PER>Malfoy</PER> had always been able to get away with anything in <PER>Snape</PER> ’s classes; <PER>Snape</PER> was head of Slytherin House, and generally favored his own students above all others.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> set up his cauldron right next to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table.
“Sir,” <PER>Malfoy</PER> called, “sir, I’ll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm — ” “Weasley, cut up <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s roots for him,” said <PER>Snape</PER> without looking up.
“Weasley, you heard Professor <PER>Snape</PER>; cut up these roots.” <PER>Ron</PER> seized his knife, pulled <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s roots toward him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.
“Professor,” drawled <PER>Malfoy</PER>, “Weasley’s mutilating my roots, sir.” <PER>Snape</PER> approached their table, stared down Weasley’s's hooked nose at the roots, then gave <PER>Ron</PER> an unpleasant smile from beneath Weasley’s's long, greasy black hair.
“Change roots with <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Weasley.” “But, sir — !” <PER>Ron</PER> had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.
<PER>Ron</PER> shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, then took up the knife again.
“Potter, you can skin <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s shrivelfig,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, giving <PER>Harry</PER> the look of loathing <PER>Harry</PER> always reserved just for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s shrivelfig as <PER>Ron</PER> began trying to repair the damage to the roots <PER>Harry</PER> now had to use.
<PER>Harry</PER> skinned <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s shrivelfig as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could and flung the shrivelfig back across the table at <PER>Malfoy</PER> without speaking.
“Father’s not very happy about my injury — ” “Keep talking, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and I’ll give you a real injury,” snarled <PER>Ron</PER>.
“To try to get <PER>Hagrid</PER> fired.” “Well,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, lowering his voice to a whisper, “ partly , Potter.
<PER>Neville</PER> regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was <PER>Neville</PER>'s worst subject, and <PER>Neville</PER>'s great fear of Professor <PER>Snape</PER> made things ten times worse.
Professor <PER>Snape</PER> potion, which was supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned — “Orange, Longbottom,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, ladling some up and allowing it to splash back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see.
“Please, sir,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “please, I could help <PER>Neville</PER> put it right — ” “I don’t remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went as pink as <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow <PER>Harry</PER>’s brass scales, “have you heard?
<PER>Hermione</PER> was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth, so that <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn’t see.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner.
“What did <PER>Malfoy</PER> mean?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle’s mouth.
<PER>Snape</PER> picked up Trevor the toad in <PER>Snape</PER>'s left hand and dipped a small spoon into <PER>Neville</PER>’s potion, which was now green.
<PER>Snape</PER>, looking sour, pulled a small bottle from the pocket of <PER>Snape</PER>'s robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor, and <PER>Snape</PER> reappeared suddenly, fully grown.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still thinking about what <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said, while <PER>Ron</PER> was seething about <PER>Snape</PER>.
“There <PER>Hermione</PER> is,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t surprised; <PER>Harry</PER> could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.
“D’you get the feeling <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s not telling us something?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>Snape</PER> was sitting in a low armchair, and Professor <PER>Snape</PER> looked around as the class filed in.
Professor <PER>Snape</PER> eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s mouth.
<PER>Harry</PER> glared at <PER>Snape</PER>; it was bad enough that <PER>Harry</PER> bullied <PER>Neville</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own classes, let alone doing it in front of other teachers.
“I was hoping that <PER>Neville</PER> would assist me with the first stage of the operation,” he said, “and I am sure he will perform it admirably.” <PER>Neville</PER>’s face went, if possible, even redder.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s lip curled, but <PER>Snape</PER> left, shutting the door with a snap.
“Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know what shape it should be?” “Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and <PER>Hermione</PER> put <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand down, looking a little disappointed.
<PER>Neville</PER> looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>.” Nearly everyone laughed.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> hmmm <PER>Neville</PER>, I believe you live with your grandmother?” “Er — yes,” said <PER>Neville</PER> nervously.
“When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, <PER>Neville</PER>, and sees you, it will assume the form of Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,” said Lupin.
<PER>Harry</PER> first thought was Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> — a <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned to full strength.
But before Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart - <PER>Voldemort</PER>, a horrible image came floating to the surface of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s mind.
<PER>Ron</PER> was muttering to himself, “Take its legs off.” <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> knew what that was about.
Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor <PER>Snape</PER> stepped out, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes flashing at <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER> backed away, <PER>Neville</PER>'s wand up, mouthing wordlessly.
<PER>Snape</PER> was bearing down upon <PER>Snape</PER>, reaching inside <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Ron</PER> had frozen.
Then — “RiddikulusV’ bellowed <PER>Ron</PER>, and the spider’s legs vanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of it way and it came to a halt at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet.
“RiddikulusV’ he shouted, and they had a split second’s view of <PER>Snape</PER> in <PER>Snape</PER>'s lacy dress before <PER>Neville</PER> let out a great “Ha!” of laughter, and the boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was gone.
“You and <PER>Hermione</PER> answered my questions correctly at the start of the class, <PER>Harry</PER>,” Lupin said lightly.
Only <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.
<PER>Harry</PER> only wished <PER>Harry</PER> was as happy with some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s other classes.
The story of the boggart assuming <PER>Snape</PER>’s shape, and the way that <PER>Neville</PER> had dressed it in his grandmother’s clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire.
<PER>Snape</PER> eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of Professor Lupin’s name, and <PER>Snape</PER> was bullying <PER>Neville</PER> worse than ever.
<PER>Harry</PER> was also growing to dread the hours <PER>Harry</PER> spent in Professor Trelawney’s stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney’s enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
their had also started using hushed voices whenever their spoke to <PER>Harry</PER>, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were on <PER>Harry</PER>'s deathbed.
At the start of October, however, <PER>Harry</PER> had something else to occupy <PER>Harry</PER>, something so enjoyable it more than made up for <PER>Harry</PER>'s unsatisfactory classes.
“What’s happened?” he asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for Astronomy.
“Ask <PER>McGonagall</PER> if you can go this time, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s supposed to stay in school — ” “<PER>Harry</PER> can’t be the only third year left behind,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Ask <PER>McGonagall</PER>, go on, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “Yeah, I think I will,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making up <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
<PER>Hermione</PER> opened <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lap.
<PER>Harry</PER> really wanted to go to bed, but <PER>Harry</PER> still had <PER>Harry</PER>'s own star chart to complete.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag toward <PER>Harry</PER>, took out parchment, ink, and quill, and started work.
“You can copy mine, if you like,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, don’t hurt him!” squealed <PER>Hermione</PER>; the whole common room was watching; <PER>Ron</PER> whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers came flying out of the top — “CATCH THAT CAT!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the terrified Scabbers.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried over; <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed Crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away; <PER>Ron</PER> threw him onto his stomach and, with great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.
“All cats chase rats, <PER>Ron</PER>!” “There’s something funny about that animal!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket.
“Crookshanks could smell him, <PER>Ron</PER>, how else d’you think — ” “That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, ignoring the people around him, who were starting to giggle.
<PER>Ron</PER> was still in a bad mood with <PER>Hermione</PER> next day.
He barely talked to her all through Herbology, even though he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were working together on the same puffapod.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who had resolved to ask Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> after the lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the rest, joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case.
“What’s the matter, Lavender?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously as she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> went to join the group.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hesitated; then <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “You — you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?” “Well, not necessarily by a fox,” said Lavender, looking up at <PER>Hermione</PER> with streaming eyes, “but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn’t I?” “Oh,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“ — and she can’t have been dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock — ” “Don’t mind <PER>Hermione</PER>, Lavender,” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, “she doesn’t think other people’s pets matter very much.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> opened the classroom door at that moment, which was perhaps lucky; <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were looking daggers at each other, and when <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> got into class, <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> seated <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> on either side of <PER>Harry</PER> and didn’t talk to each other for the whole class.
<PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t decided what <PER>Harry</PER> was going to say to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.
“Go for it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> stubbornly.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed nervously for Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s desk.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked over Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s square spectacles at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> but didn’t say anything.
“So — er — d’you think it would be all right — I mean, will it be okay if I — if I go to Hogsmeade?” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked down and began shuffling papers on Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s desk.
“If you said I could go — ” “But I don’t say so,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, standing up and piling Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s papers neatly into a drawer.
<PER>Ron</PER> called Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> a lot of names that greatly annoyed <PER>Hermione</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> assumed an “all-for-the-best” expression that made <PER>Ron</PER> even angrier, and <PER>Harry</PER> had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade.
“There’s always the feast,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, in an effort to cheer <PER>Harry</PER> up.
Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon’s signature on the form, but as <PER>Harry</PER> had already told Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> he hadn’t had it signed, that was no good.
<PER>Ron</PER> halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but <PER>Hermione</PER> stamped on that one, reminding <PER>Ron</PER> what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told them about the dementors being able to see through them.
“All right, the sweetshop’s rather good, and Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dangerous, and yes, the Shrieking Shack’s always worth a visit, but really, <PER>Harry</PER>, apart from that, you’re not missing anything.” On Halloween morning, <PER>Harry</PER> awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing <PER>Harry</PER>'s best to act normally.
He and <PER>Hermione</PER> had finally forgotten He and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s squabble about Crookshanks in the face of <PER>Harry</PER>’s difficulties.
“Don’t worry about me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in what <PER>Harry</PER> hoped was an offhand voice, “I’ll see you at the feast.
“Scared of passing the dementors?” <PER>Harry</PER> ignored <PER>Harry</PER> and made <PER>Harry</PER>'s solitary way up the marble staircase, through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.
<PER>Harry</PER> wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there <PER>Harry</PER> changed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind; <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel like working.
But <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t go back to the common room; <PER>Harry</PER> climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said, “<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin, looking around <PER>Harry</PER>'s office door.
“Where are <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Hogsmeade,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in a would-be casual voice.
“I’ve only got teabags, I’m afraid — but I daresay you’ve had enough of tea leaves?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> told me,” said Lupin, passing <PER>Harry</PER> a chipped mug of tea.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want Lupin to think <PER>Harry</PER> was a coward, especially since Lupin already seemed to think <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t cope with a boggart.
Something of <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts seemed to have shown on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, because Lupin said, “Anything worrying you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied.
<PER>Harry</PER> drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> said suddenly, putting <PER>Harry</PER>'s tea down on Lupin’s desk.
“Well,” said Lupin, frowning slightly, “I assumed that if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> stared.
The only person <PER>Harry</PER> had ever heard say the name aloud (apart from <PER>Harry</PER>) was Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>'s black eyes narrowing.
It was dusk, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they’d had the time of their lives.
“But if he — you know” — <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped — <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice, glancing nervously around — “if he was trying to — to poison Lupin — he wouldn’t have done it in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Yeah, maybe,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall.
The food was delicious; even <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes along the table, to the place where <PER>Snape</PER> sat.
Was <PER>Snape</PER> imagining it, or were <PER>Snape</PER> ’s eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?
It had been such a pleasant evening that <PER>Harry</PER>’s good mood couldn’t even be spoiled by <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall, “The dementors send their love, Potter!” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students.
<PER>Harry</PER> peered over the heads in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
A moment later, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> through, and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved closer to see what the trouble was.
“Oh, my — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes somber, to see Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Lupin, and <PER>Snape</PER> hurrying toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t dare taunt <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Instead <PER>Dumbledore</PER> adopted an oily voice that was no better than <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s cackle.
“The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,” Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told The teachers and I as Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Flitwick closed all doors into the hall.
“Send word with one of the ghosts.” Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> paused, about to leave the hall, and said, “Oh, yes, you’ll be needing ” One casual wave of Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.
“Sleep well,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, closing the door behind Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> obviously thinks he might be,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Honestly, am I the only person who’s ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A History?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> crossly to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
What with that, and the whispering that still filled the hall, <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> were sleeping outdoors in a light wind.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping bags, telling people off for talking.
Percy was only a short way away from <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who quickly pretended to be asleep as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s footsteps drew nearer.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head very slightly off <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms to free his other ear.
“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.” <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s back was to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could see Percy’s face, rapt with attention, and <PER>Snape</PER> ’s profile, which looked angry.
<PER>Snape</PER> stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on <PER>Snape</PER>'s face; then <PER>Snape</PER> too left.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
To cap it all, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> summoned <PER>Harry</PER> into her office, with such a somber expression on her face <PER>Harry</PER> thought someone must have died.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor team’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d suggested <PER>Harry</PER> as Seeker in the first place.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited, holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath.
“There’s nothing wrong with <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s arm!” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no room in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow.
The third time this happened, Oliver Wood talked for so long that <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized <PER>Harry</PER> was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, “Diggory’s got a very fast swerve, <PER>Harry</PER>, so you might want to try looping him — ” <PER>Harry</PER> skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.
“I believe I told you to sit down?” But <PER>Harry</PER> stayed where <PER>Harry</PER> was.
“Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be fifty.” <PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat and sat down.
“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far — ” “Please, sir, we’ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, “and we’re just about to start — ” “Be quiet,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly.
“But, sir,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, seemingly unable to restrain <PER>Hermione</PER>, “we’re not supposed to do werewolves yet, we’re due to start hinkypunks — ” “Miss Granger,” said <PER>Snape</PER> in a voice of deadly calm, “I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you.
“Anyone?” <PER>Snape</PER> said, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.” <PER>Hermione</PER> went very red, put down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand, and stared at the floor with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes full of tears.
It was a mark of how much the class loathed <PER>Snape</PER> that they were all glaring at him, because every one of they had called <PER>Hermione</PER> a know-it-all at least once, and <PER>Ron</PER>, who told <PER>Hermione</PER> she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, “You asked us a question and she knows the answer!
<PER>Snape</PER> advanced on <PER>Ron</PER> slowly, and the room held its breath.
“Detention, Weasley,” <PER>Snape</PER> said silkily, his face very close to <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
“<PER>Snape</PER> ’s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“D’you know what that — ” (he called <PER>Snape</PER> something that made <PER>Hermione</PER> say “<PER>Ron</PER>\”) “ — is making me do?
<PER>Harry</PER> fumbled for <PER>Harry</PER>'s alarm clock and looked at his alarm clock.
“You know, I reckon <PER>Ron</PER> was right about you,” <PER>Harry</PER> told Crookshanks suspiciously.
At long last <PER>Harry</PER> thought it must be time for breakfast, so <PER>Harry</PER> headed through the portrait hole alone.
Just before he entered the locker room, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.
<PER>Harry</PER> rose fast, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind.
Within five minutes <PER>Harry</PER> was soaked to <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin and frozen, hardly able to see <PER>Harry</PER>'s teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch.
Twice <PER>Harry</PER> came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; Twice <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses his hadn’t seen them coming.
Twice <PER>Harry</PER> nearly hit another player, without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly tell them apart.
With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch’s whistle; <PER>Harry</PER> could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing <PER>Harry</PER> to the ground.
“Come on, under here — ” They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; <PER>Harry</PER> took off <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and wiped They hurriedly on <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
At that very moment, <PER>Hermione</PER> appeared at his shoulder; <PER>Hermione</PER> was holding <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cloak over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head and was, inexplicably, beaming.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still numb with cold, still wetter than he’d ever been in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, but <PER>Harry</PER> could see.
Full of fresh determination, <PER>Harry</PER> urged <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom through the turbulent air, staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction.
<PER>Harry</PER> needed to get the Snitch quickly — <PER>Harry</PER> turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw something that distracted <PER>Harry</PER> completely — the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s numb hands slipped on the broom handle and <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus dropped a few feet.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, behind you!” <PER>Harry</PER> looked wildly around.
Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them — With a jolt of panic, <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> flat to the broom-handle and zoomed toward the Snitch.
Before he’d had time to think, <PER>Harry</PER> had taken <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes off the Snitch and looked down.
At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at <PER>Harry</PER>, were standing beneath <PER>Harry</PER>.
Someone was screaming, screaming inside Someone's head a woman “Not <PER>Harry</PER>, not <PER>Harry</PER>, please not <PER>Harry</PER>\” “ Stand aside, you silly girl stand aside, now.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have a clue where <PER>Harry</PER> was, or how He’d got there, or what He’d been doing before <PER>Harry</PER> got there.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that every inch of <PER>Harry</PER> was aching as though it had been beaten.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were also there, looking as though they’d just climbed out of a swimming pool.
“We think he’s trying to drown he.” <PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s face to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, his hands gripping his hair.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved nearer to <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was really angry,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said in a quaking voice.
He looked up and saw <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.
“Did someone get my Nimbus?” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked quickly at each other.
“And?” “And it hit — it hit — oh, <PER>Harry</PER> — it hit the Whomping Willow.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides lurched.
Slowly, <PER>Hermione</PER> reached down for a bag at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of <PER>Harry</PER>’s faithful, finally beaten broomstick.
He knew He was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help the Nimbus was beyond repair; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d lost one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s best friends.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had made she, which sang shrilly unless <PER>Harry</PER> kept it shut under his bowl of fruit.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedside only at night.
But nothing anyone said or did could make <PER>Harry</PER> feel any better, because they knew only half of what was troubling <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t told anyone about the Grim, not even <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, because he knew <PER>Ron</PER> would panic and <PER>Hermione</PER> would scoff.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt sick and humiliated every time <PER>Harry</PER> thought of them.
<PER>Harry</PER> had heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while <PER>Harry</PER> lay awake, staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling.
When the dementors approached <PER>Harry</PER>, the dementors heard the last moments of the dementors's mother’s life, her attempts to protect him, <PER>Harry</PER>, from Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s laughter before <PER>Voldemort</PER> murdered her .
<PER>Harry</PER> dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s voice.
It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, even if he had to endure <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s taunting.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was almost beside <PER>Malfoy</PER> with glee at Gryffindor’s defeat.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> had finally taken off <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s bandages, and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of <PER>Harry</PER> falling off He's broom.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> spent much of their next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; <PER>Ron</PER> finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, which hit him in the face and caused <PER>Snape</PER> to take fifty points from Gryffindor.
“If <PER>Snape</PER>’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I’m skiving off,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they headed toward Lupin’s classroom after lunch.
“Check who’s in there, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” <PER>Hermione</PER> peered around the classroom door.
It certainly looked as though he had been ill. he old robes were hanging more loosely on he and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about <PER>Snape</PER>’s behavior while Professor Lupin had been ill. “It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?” “us don’t know anything about werewolves — ” “ — two rolls of parchment!” “Did you tell Professor <PER>Snape</PER> us haven’t covered them yet?” Professor Lupin asked, frowning slightly.
When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door, <PER>Harry</PER> among them, but — “Wait a moment, <PER>Harry</PER>,” Lupin called.
“I can hear <PER>Voldemort</PER> murdering my mum.” Lupin made a sudden motion with <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm as though to grip <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, but thought better of it.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though <PER>Ron</PER> said it was because he couldn’t stand two weeks with Percy, and <PER>Hermione</PER> insisted <PER>Hermione</PER> needed to use the library, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t fooled; they were doing it to keep <PER>Harry</PER> company, and <PER>Harry</PER> was very grateful.
“Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!” Resigned to the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> would be the only third year staying behind again, <PER>Harry</PER> borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very slow and jerky; <PER>Harry</PER> definitely needed a new broom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, <PER>Harry</PER> bid good-bye to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the marble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower.
“A bit of old parchment!” said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as though <PER>Harry</PER> had mortally offended <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Explain, George.” “Well when we were in we first year, <PER>Harry</PER> — young, carefree, and innocent — ” <PER>Harry</PER> snorted.
A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was pacing Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s study; the caretaker’s cat, Mistress Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room.
And as <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed something else.
But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something <PER>Harry</PER> had once heard Arthur say came floating out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s memory.
Aids for Magical Mischief-Makers but then, <PER>Harry</PER> reasoned, <PER>Harry</PER> only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn’t as though <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to steal anything or attack anyone and Fred and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening.
<PER>Harry</PER> traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with <PER>Harry</PER>'s finger.
Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, <PER>Harry</PER> rolled up the map, stuffed it inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with <PER>Harry</PER> little ink self's minute wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly took out <PER>Harry</PER>'s real wand and tapped the statue.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted <PER>Harry</PER> into the hole headfirst, and pushed <PER>Harry</PER> forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand out in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
It took ages, but <PER>Harry</PER> had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain <PER>Harry</PER>.
Panting, <PER>Harry</PER> sped up, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face hot, <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet very cold.
Ten minutes later, <PER>Harry</PER> came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which rose out of sight above <PER>Harry</PER>.
A hundred steps, two hundred steps, <PER>Harry</PER> lost count as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed, watching <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood there, massaging the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, listening.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t hear any sounds above <PER>Harry</PER>.
Wondering what <PER>Harry</PER> ought to do, <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> might not get another chance — Quickly and silently, <PER>Harry</PER> dodged out from <PER>Harry</PER>'s hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back, <PER>Harry</PER> saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head, buried in a box.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached the door at the top of the stairs, slipped through the door, and found <PER>Harry</PER> behind the counter of Honeydukes <PER>Harry</PER> ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.
He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as He imagined the look that would spread over <PER>Dudley</PER>’s piggy face if he could see where <PER>Harry</PER> was now.
<PER>Harry</PER> squeezed <PER>Harry</PER> through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES).
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored lollipops.
“Ugh, no, <PER>Harry</PER> won’t want one of those, they’re for vampires, I expect,” <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying.
“How about these?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shoving ajar of Cockroach Clusters under <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s nose.
“<PER>Harry</PER>\” squealed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m their brother!” “But <PER>Harry</PER> isn’t going to keep it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as though the idea were ludicrous.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s going to hand it in to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, aren’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “No, I’m not!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you mad?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, goggling at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh — of course not — but honestly, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel.
“Reckon Fred’d take a bit of Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?” When <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had paid for all their sweets, the three of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside.
<PER>Harry</PER> shivered; unlike the other two, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak.
They headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shouting through their scarves.
“That’s the post office — ” “Zonko’s is up there — ” “We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — ” “Tell you what,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his teeth chattering, “shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?” <PER>Harry</PER> was more than willing; the wind was fierce and <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands were freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s way to the back of the room, where there was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas tree, which stood next to the fireplace.
It was the most delicious thing <PER>Harry</PER>’d ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of <PER>Harry</PER> from the inside.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over the rim of <PER>Harry</PER>'s tankard and choked.
Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak — <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge, Minister of Magic.
In an instant, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had both placed hands on the top of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head and forced him off his stool and under the table.
Dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, <PER>Harry</PER> clutched <PER>Harry</PER>'s empty tankard and watched the teachers’ and Fudge’s feet move toward the bar, pause, then turn and walk right toward him.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw the lower part of Fudge’s thick body twist in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair as though <PER>Harry</PER> were checking for eavesdroppers.
“Did you tell the whole pub, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> exasperatedly.
“James Potter told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself and yet, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> remained worried.
“He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping <PER>Voldemort</PER> informed of their movements,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> darkly.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, please!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“You know, <PER>Cornelius</PER>, if you’re dining with the headmaster, we’d better head back up to the castle,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s faces appeared under the table.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have a very clear idea of how <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to get back into the Honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle once more.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, Arthur, <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge why hadn’t anyone ever mentioned the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>’s parents had died because their best friend had betrayed their?
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> nervously all through dinner, not daring to talk about what they’d overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them.
Their best man <PER>Harry</PER> had never given Their best man <PER>Harry</PER> a thought before.
Did <PER>Harry</PER> realize <PER>Harry</PER> was facing twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make <PER>Harry</PER> unrecognizable?
But the dementors don’t affect <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, staring into the handsome, laughing face.
<PER>Harry</PER> doesn’t have to hear my mum screaming if they get too close — <PER>Harry</PER> slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into — <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabinet, took off — <PER>Harry</PER>'s robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings were hiding him from view.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice uncertainly.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> leave again, and rolled over on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes wide open.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you — you look terrible.” <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t gotten to sleep until daybreak.
<PER>Harry</PER> had awoken to find the dormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for <PER>Ron</PER>, who was eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had spread her homework over three tables.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, listen,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, exchanging a look with <PER>Ron</PER>, “you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while <PER>Harry</PER> had been asleep.
“You won’t, will you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“D’you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shook their heads, looking apprehensive.
“<PER>Harry</PER> doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” Again, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t answer.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know what <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to do.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more than <PER>Harry</PER> could stand.
“He was right in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s inner circle — ” “ Say You-Knotu-Who, will you?” interjected <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
“ — so obviously, the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s knew Black was working for <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “ — and <PER>Malfoy</PER>’d love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like Pettigrew!
“<PER>Harry</PER> isn’t supposed to leave the castle, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “Yeah, let’s go,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting up, “and I can ask <PER>Harry</PER> how come <PER>Harry</PER> never mentioned Black when <PER>Harry</PER> told me all about my parents!” Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn’t what <PER>Ron</PER> had had in mind.
“Listen — is that Fang?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> put their ears to the door too.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” called <PER>Harry</PER>, thumping the door.
<PER>Harry</PER>, about to collapse under <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s weight, was rescued by <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who each seized <PER>Hagrid</PER> under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what is it?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, aghast.
“What’s this, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s sobs redoubled, but <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s shoved the letter toward <PER>Harry</PER>, who picked it up and read aloud: Dear Mister <PER>Hagrid</PER>, Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class, our have accepted the assurances of Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.
“Well, that’s okay then, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, clapping <PER>Hagrid</PER> on the shoulder.
But <PER>Hagrid</PER> continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting <PER>Harry</PER> to read on.
“They’ve got it in fer interestin’ creatures!” A sudden sound from the corner of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin made <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> whip around.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sitting down and laying a hand on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s massive forearm.
“What about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Got enough on his plate what with keepin’ them dementors outta the castle, an’ Sirius Black lurkin’ around — ” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked quickly at <PER>Harry</PER>, as though expecting him to start berating <PER>Hagrid</PER> for not telling him the truth about Black.
But <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t bring <PER>Harry</PER> to do it, not now that <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> so miserable and scared.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER> to help them.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched him breathlessly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had never heard <PER>Hagrid</PER> talk about his brief spell in Azkaban before.
After a pause, <PER>Hermione</PER> said timidly, “Is it awful in there, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “Yeh’ve no idea,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> quietly.
“I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.” The trip to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the effect <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had hoped.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> had by no means forgotten about Black, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t brood constantly on revenge if <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to help <PER>Hagrid</PER> win his case against the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak.
On Christmas morning, <PER>Harry</PER> was woken by <PER>Ron</PER> throwing <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillow at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Dunno ” <PER>Harry</PER> ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedspread.
“ Who — ?” “I know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, controlling himself, “I know who it could’ve been — Lupin!” “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, now starting to laugh himself.
“I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from <PER>Snape</PER>, remember?” <PER>Harry</PER> frowned at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I can’t see Lupin affording something like this.” “What ’re you two laughing about?” <PER>Hermione</PER> had just come in, wearing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>\ Who sent you that?” “No idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
On the contrary, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face fell, and <PER>Hermione</PER> bit <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip.
“Well who’d send <PER>Harry</PER> something as expensive as that, and not even tell <PER>Harry</PER> they’d sent it?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at her.
“What d’you think <PER>Harry</PER>’s going to do with it — sweep the floor?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
But before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus’s bed, right at <PER>Ron</PER>’s chest.
<PER>Ron</PER> seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed, knocking it over and causing <PER>Ron</PER> to hop up and down, howling with pain.
“You’d better take that cat out of here, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> furiously, sitting on <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed nursing <PER>Harry</PER>'s toe.
“Can’t you shut that thing up?” he added to <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Hermione</PER> strode out of the room, Crookshanks ’s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on <PER>Ron</PER>.
It had been a while since <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER> out of <PER>Ron</PER>’s pocket, and <PER>Harry</PER> was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too.
And despite <PER>Ron</PER>’s frequent complaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure <PER>Ron</PER> would be very miserable if Scabbers died.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had shut Crookshanks in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s dormitory, but was furious with <PER>Ron</PER> for trying to kick him; <PER>Ron</PER> was still fuming about Crookshanks ’s fresh attempt to eat Scabbers.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted <PER>Harry</PER> to examining the Firebolt, which <PER>Harry</PER> had brought down to the common room with <PER>Harry</PER>.
For some reason this seemed to annoy <PER>Hermione</PER> as well; <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t say anything, but <PER>Hermione</PER> kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cat.
Professors <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat.
“Merry Christmas!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> approached the table.
“Crackers!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> enthusiastically, offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to <PER>Snape</PER>, who took it reluctantly and tugged.
<PER>Harry</PER>, remembering the boggart, caught <PER>Ron</PER>’s eye and they both grinned; <PER>Snape</PER> ’s mouth thinned and <PER>Snape</PER> pushed the hat toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who swapped it for <PER>Snape</PER>'s wizard’s hat at once.
As <PER>Harry</PER> was helping <PER>Harry</PER> to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great Hall opened again.
“Let me draw you up a chair — ” And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“I doubt,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which put an end to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Professor Trelawney’s conversation, “that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger.
Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still wearing their party hats, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly.
“I doubt it will make much difference,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> coldly, “unless a mad axe-man is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the entrance hall.” Even <PER>Ron</PER> laughed.
“Coming?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“No,” <PER>Hermione</PER> muttered, “I want a quick word with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.” “Probably trying to see if she can take any more classes,” yawned <PER>Ron</PER> as they made their way into the entrance hall, which was completely devoid of mad axe-men.
<PER>Harry</PER> went straight up to the dormitory, collected the Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> for <PER>Harry</PER>'s birthday, brought them downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and <PER>Hermione</PER> came in, accompanied by Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Though Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was head of Gryffindor House, <PER>Harry</PER> had seen her in the common room only once before, and that had been to make a very grave announcement.
<PER>Hermione</PER> walked around them, sat down, picked up the nearest book, and hid <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face behind it.
“Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked around at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“May I?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> didn’t wait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of their hands.
“Well, I’m afraid I will have to take this, Potter.” “W — what?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, scrambling to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“Of course, I’m no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down — ” “Strip it down?” repeated <PER>Ron</PER>, as though Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was mad.
“You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.” “There’s nothing wrong with it!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice shaking slightly.
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, rounded on <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What did you go running to <PER>McGonagall</PER> for?” <PER>Hermione</PER> threw her book aside.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced <PER>Ron</PER> defiantly.
“Because I thought — and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> agrees with me — that that broom was probably sent to <PER>Harry</PER> by Sirius Black!” <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hermione</PER> had meant well, but that didn’t stop <PER>Harry</PER> from being angry with <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know whether <PER>Harry</PER> would ever see it again.
<PER>Ron</PER> was furious with <PER>Hermione</PER> too.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didn’t try to persuade shis to come back.
The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had the shortest life line she had ever seen.
It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that <PER>Harry</PER> was keen to get to; after <PER>Harry</PER>'s conversation with Wood, <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to get started on <PER>Harry</PER>'s anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible.
“Ah yes,” said Lupin, when <PER>Harry</PER> reminded him of <PER>Harry</PER>'s promise at the end of class.
“Fine,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> haughtily, and <PER>Hermione</PER> marched off.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> doesn’t know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, staring resentfully after <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>’s just trying to get us to talk to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s again.” At eight o’clock on Thursday evening, <PER>Harry</PER> left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom.
It was dark and empty when <PER>Harry</PER> arrived, but <PER>Harry</PER> lit the lamps with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and had waited only five minutes when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which Professor Lupin heaved onto Professor Binns’ desk.
“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin, “which is a kind of anti- dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.” <PER>Harry</PER> had a sudden vision of <PER>Harry</PER> crouching behind a <PER>Hagrid</PER>-sized figure holding a large club.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.” “And how do you conjure it?” “With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.” <PER>Harry</PER> cast <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind about for a happy memory.
“Expecto patronum).” “Expecto patronum,” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated under his breath, “expecto patronum.” “Concentrating hard on your happy memory?” “Oh — yeah — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, quickly forcing <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts back to that first broom ride.
“Right, then — ready to try it on a dementor?” “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, gripping <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind on flying, but something else kept intruding .
Any second now, <PER>Harry</PER> might hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother again but <PER>Harry</PER> shouldn’t think that, or <PER>Harry</PER> would hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother's again, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to or did <PER>Harry</PER>?
A wave of piercing cold broke over <PER>Harry</PER> — “Expecto patronurrd” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
<PER>Harry</PER> was falling again through thick white fog, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s voice was louder than ever, echoing inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s head — “ Not <PER>Harry</PER>\ Not <PER>Harry</PER>\ Please — I’ll do anything — ” “Stand aside.
<PER>Harry</PER> was lying flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on the floor.
“Yes ” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> up on one of the desks and leaned against it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than understand — ” “I do!” said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely, stuffing the rest of the <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog into <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
“Ready,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying hard to fill <PER>Harry</PER>'s head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened.
The dementor glided forward, drawing The dementor breath; one rotting hand was extending toward <PER>Harry</PER> — “Expecto patronum).” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
This time it was a minute before <PER>Harry</PER> understood why <PER>Harry</PER> was lying on a dusty classroom floor.
Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he’d realized he’d be leaving Privet Drive, <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and faced the packing case once more.
“ EXPECTO PATRONUM EXPECTO PATRONUM ” The screaming inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head had started again — except this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and louder and softer again — and he could still see the dementor — it had halted — and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, to hover between <PER>Harry</PER> and the dementor, and though <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs felt like water, <PER>Harry</PER> was still on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet — though for how much longer, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure — “ RiddikulusV’ roared Lupin, springing forward.
Then <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts wandered back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother and father.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt drained and strangely empty, even though <PER>Harry</PER> was so full of chocolate.
Terrible though it was to hear his parents’ last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times <PER>Harry</PER> had heard these's voices since <PER>Harry</PER> was a very small child.
This meant that with Lupin’s anti- dementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, <PER>Harry</PER> had just one night a week to do all <PER>Harry</PER>'s homework.
Even so, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t showing the strain nearly as much as <PER>Hermione</PER>, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her.
Every night, without fail, <PER>Hermione</PER> was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; <PER>Hermione</PER> barely spoke to anybody and snapped when <PER>Hermione</PER> was interrupted.
“How’s <PER>Hermione</PER> doing it?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> one evening as <PER>Harry</PER> sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was now asking Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> for news of the Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, <PER>Ron</PER> standing hopefully at his shoulder, <PER>Hermione</PER> rushing past with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face averted.
All it did was hover, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining <PER>Harry</PER> of energy as <PER>Harry</PER> fought to keep it there.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt angry with <PER>Harry</PER>, guilty about <PER>Harry</PER>'s secret desire to hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ voices again.
“Oh — <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> brought me some back from Hogsmeade,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied quickly.
<PER>Harry</PER> half wished that <PER>Harry</PER> half hadn’t asked what was under a dementor’s hood, the answer had been so horrible, and <PER>Harry</PER> half was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that <PER>Harry</PER> half walked headlong into Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> halfway up the stairs.
“She’s in the common room now — working, for a change — ” They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom entrance.
Then, spotting <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>: “Good even, my fine young yeomen!
“I made <PER>Neville</PER> tell me what passwords <PER>Neville</PER> was going to use this week, because <PER>Neville</PER> keeps changing what passwords, and now I don’t know what I’ve done with what passwords!” “Oddsbodikins,” said <PER>Harry</PER> to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room.
There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was surrounded by people exclaiming over <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt.
“Where ’d you get it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Will you let me have a go?” “Have you ridden it yet, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Ravenclaw’ll have no chance, they’re all on Cleansweep Sevens!” “Can I just hold it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had a clear view of <PER>Hermione</PER>, the only person who hadn’t rushed over to them, bent over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s work and carefully avoiding them's eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> approached her table and at last, she looked up.
“Can I sit down, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (“Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity”) and at the rune translation <PER>Hermione</PER> was now poring over.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the sheet <PER>Ron</PER> was holding.
<PER>Ron</PER> threw something down onto <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s rune translation.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward.
It looked like the end of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s friendship.
<PER>Ron</PER> was enraged that <PER>Hermione</PER> had never taken Crookshanks’s attempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn’t bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that <PER>Ron</PER> look for Scabbers under all the boys’ beds.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that <PER>Ron</PER> had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that <PER>Ron</PER> had been prejudiced against <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on <PER>Ron</PER>’s head in the Magical Menagerie.
Personally, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when <PER>Harry</PER> tried to point out to <PER>Hermione</PER> that the evidence all pointed that way, <PER>Hermione</PER> lost <PER>Hermione</PER>'s temper with <PER>Harry</PER> too.
“Remember, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yeah, that’s true,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; <PER>Harry</PER> outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute’s head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; <PER>Harry</PER> spotted it lurking near Katie Bell’s knee, looped Katie Bell’s's easily, and caught it again.
“Not unless — <PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve sorted out your dementor problem, haven’t you?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking of <PER>Harry</PER>'s feeble Patronus and wishing it were stronger.
“Here you go,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, handing <PER>Ron</PER> the Firebolt.
<PER>Ron</PER>, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while <PER>Harry</PER> walked around the edge of the field, watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> off for not waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle.
<PER>Harry</PER> shouldered the Firebolt and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt’s superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning.
They were halfway toward the castle when <PER>Harry</PER>, glancing to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left, saw something that made <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart turn over — a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped dead, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart banging against <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs.
Slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t say anything to <PER>Ron</PER> — nor did <PER>Ron</PER> — look left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor.
“Did you see his face?” said <PER>Ron</PER> gleefully, looking back at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Goyle right behind him.
“Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s pale eyes narrowed, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> stalked away.
They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put They's heads together, no doubt asking <PER>Malfoy</PER> whether <PER>Harry</PER>’s broom really was a Firebolt.
<PER>Harry</PER> took off <PER>Harry</PER>'s black school robes, removed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes.
She was shorter than <PER>Harry</PER> by about a head, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help noticing, nervous as <PER>Harry</PER> was, that She was extremely pretty.
She smiled at <PER>Harry</PER> as the teams faced each other behind the teams's captains, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt a slight lurch in the region of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach that <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t think had anything to do with nerves.
“Mount your brooms on my whistle three — two — one — ” <PER>Harry</PER> kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; <PER>Harry</PER> soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins’ friend Lee Jordan.
“Right you are, Professor — just giving a bit of background information — the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and — ” “Jordan!” “Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor heading for goal ” <PER>Harry</PER> streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that <PER>Cho</PER> Chang was tailing him closely.
<PER>Harry</PER> urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and <PER>Cho</PER> fell behind.
<PER>Harry</PER> dived; <PER>Cho</PER> saw what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing and tore after <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were <PER>Harry</PER>'s speciality, <PER>Harry</PER> was ten feet away — Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of nowhere; <PER>Harry</PER> veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically — a glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings — the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post — <PER>Harry</PER> accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead — but just then, <PER>Cho</PER> appeared out of thin air, blocking <PER>Cho</PER> — “<PER>Harry</PER>, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!” Wood roared as <PER>Harry</PER> swerved to avoid a collision.
“KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!” <PER>Harry</PER> turned and caught sight of <PER>Cho</PER>; <PER>Cho</PER> was grinning.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game.
him dived again, and <PER>Cho</PER>, thinking He’d seen the Snitch, tried to follow; <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; <PER>Harry</PER> rose fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time — the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.
Plunging a hand down the neck of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, <PER>Harry</PER> whipped out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and roared, “Expecto patronum).” Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on <PER>Harry</PER>; next moment, the whole team was hugging <PER>Harry</PER> so hard <PER>Harry</PER> was nearly pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all kissed <PER>Harry</PER>; Fred had <PER>Harry</PER> in a grip so tight <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s head would come off.
<PER>Harry</PER> got off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom and looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, <PER>Ron</PER> in the lead.
“Yes!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, yanking <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm into the air.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who had fought his way through to <PER>Harry</PER>’s side, doubled up with laughter as they watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> fighting to extricate himself from the robe, Goyle’s head still stuck inside it.
<PER>Harry</PER> broke away from the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And I’m very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.” “Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>, come and have some food,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking over at <PER>Ron</PER> and wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.
“Can’t you give shis a break?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match.
At last, exhausted, <PER>Harry</PER> climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep.
<PER>Harry</PER> broke into a run, and ahead <PER>Harry</PER> heard hooves gathering speed.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> was running flat out, and ahead <PER>Harry</PER> could hear galloping.
Disoriented in the total darkness, <PER>Harry</PER> fumbled with his hangings — <PER>Harry</PER> could hear movements around <PER>Harry</PER>, and Seamus Finnigan’s voice from the other side of the room: “What’s going on?” <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard the dormitory door slam.
At last finding the divide in <PER>Harry</PER>'s curtains, <PER>Harry</PER> ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit Dean Thomas's lamp.
“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming, <PER>Ron</PER>?” “I’m telling you, I saw him!” “What’s all the noise?” “Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> told us to go to bed!” A few of the girls had come down the girls's staircase, pulling on dressing gowns and yawning.
“You had too much to eat, <PER>Ron</PER> — had a nightmare — ” “I’m telling you — ” “Now, really, enough’s enough!” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was back.
“PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stared at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Ask him if him saw — ” Glaring suspiciously at <PER>Ron</PER>, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> pushed the portrait back open and went outside.
<PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy-slippered toes, raised <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom's hand slowly into the air.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> came back at dawn, to tell them that Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had again escaped.
It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they — and now <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> — were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it.
“D’you reckon we should tell someone?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“We know he’s not coming in through Honey duke’s,” said <PER>Ron</PER> dismissively “We’d’ve heard if the shop had been broken into.” <PER>Harry</PER> was glad <PER>Ron</PER> took this view.
For the first time in his life, people were paying more attention to his than to <PER>Harry</PER>, and it was clear that <PER>Ron</PER> was rather enjoying the experience.
“Why, though?” <PER>Ron</PER> added to <PER>Harry</PER> as the group of second-year girls who had been listening to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chilling tale departed.
Why had Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced <PER>Ron</PER> and proceeded to <PER>Harry</PER>?
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was so furious with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had banned Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> from all future Hogsmeade visits, given Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> a detention, and forbidden anyone to give Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> the password into the tower.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who were sitting opposite him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once — <PER>Ron</PER> had got one from — <PER>Ron</PER>'s mother the year before.
“Run for it, <PER>Neville</PER>,” — <PER>Ron</PER> advised.
<PER>Neville</PER> seized the envelope, and holding the envelope before <PER>Neville</PER> like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of He.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too busy feeling sorry for <PER>Neville</PER> to notice immediately that <PER>Harry</PER> had a letter too.
The note inside said: Dear <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, How about having tea with me this afternoon ’round six?
WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN Cheers, <PER>Hagrid</PER> “He probably wants to hear all about Black!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
So at six o’clock that afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> left Gryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance hall.
“All right, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
The first thing they saw on entering <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets.
Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, <PER>Harry</PER> saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s wardrobe door.
“What are they for, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns, but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cooking.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“I’m not blamin’ yeh!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, waving <PER>Harry</PER>’s apology aside.
<PER>Harry</PER> started and looked around at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, if you go into Hogsmeade again I’ll tell Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> about that map!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Can you hear someone talking, <PER>Harry</PER>?” growled <PER>Ron</PER>, not looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Haven’t you done enough damage this year?” <PER>Hermione</PER> opened <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap.
<PER>Hermione</PER> took one frightened look at the expression on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the girls’ dormitories.
“So how about it?” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER> as though there had been no interruption.
“But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.” On Saturday morning, <PER>Harry</PER> packed <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder’s Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone else.
<PER>Hermione</PER> kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him, but him avoided <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eye and was careful to let <PER>Hermione</PER>'s see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors.
“ ’Bye!” <PER>Harry</PER> called to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder’s Map out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket as <PER>Harry</PER> went.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, muttered, “ Dissendium).” and shoved <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag into the statue, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could climb in <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER> came around the corner.
<PER>Neville</PER> took a quick step behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“An odd place to meet — ” To <PER>Harry</PER>’s immense disquiet, <PER>Snape</PER>’s black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.
<PER>Snape</PER> was running one of <PER>Snape</PER>'s hands over the one-eyed witch’s head, examining it closely.
<PER>Harry</PER> managed to shake <PER>Neville</PER> off at the Fat Lady by telling <PER>Harry</PER> the password, then pretending <PER>Harry</PER>’d left <PER>Harry</PER>'s vampire essay in the library and doubling back.
<PER>Harry</PER> scanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus <PER>Snape</PER> was now back in its office.
<PER>Harry</PER> sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved <PER>Harry</PER> inside, and slid down to meet <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag at the bottom of the stone chute.
<PER>Harry</PER>, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded <PER>Ron</PER> in the back.
“Where are you?” <PER>Ron</PER> kept muttering out of the corner of <PER>Snape</PER>'s mouth.
There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s wildest dreams; <PER>Harry</PER> gave <PER>Ron</PER> whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak.
“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend he There’s no ’arm in ’im, ’onest — ’ that hippogriff’s as good as dead — ” <PER>Malfoy</PER> suddenly caught sight of <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What are you doing, Weasley?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked up at the crumbling house behind <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> crept silently around behind <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path.
“We were just discussing your friend <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Malfoy</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly around, <PER>Malfoy</PER> trying to wipe his hair clean.
“It came from over there!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, wiping <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s face, and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of <PER>Harry</PER>.
As <PER>Ron</PER> was the only person Crabbe could see, it was <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> started toward, but <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> stuck out <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg.
Crabbe stumbled — and Crabbe's huge, flat foot caught the hem of <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a great tug, then cloak slid off <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
For a split second, <PER>Malfoy</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where <PER>Harry</PER> had disappeared, “you’d better run for it!
<PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach turned over — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would know exactly what had happened, if <PER>Malfoy</PER> said anything — Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone floor, through the trapdoor — <PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the cloak, tucked the cloak under — <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> would get back first how long would it take <PER>Malfoy</PER> to find a teacher?
Panting, a sharp pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s side, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t slow down until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the stone slide.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was too much of a giveaway in case <PER>Malfoy</PER> had tipped off a teacher <PER>Harry</PER> hid it in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could, <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached the inside of the witch’s hump, tapped it with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, stuck <PER>Harry</PER>'s head through, and hoisted <PER>Harry</PER> out; the hump closed, and just as <PER>Harry</PER> jumped out from behind the statue, <PER>Harry</PER> heard quick footsteps approaching.
He approached <PER>Harry</PER> at a swift walk, <PER>Harry</PER>'s black robes swishing, then stopped in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to look innocent, all too aware of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweaty face and <PER>Harry</PER>'s muddy hands, which <PER>Harry</PER> quickly hid in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pockets.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed him downstairs, trying to wipe <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands clean on the inside of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes without <PER>Snape</PER> noticing.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been in here only once before, and <PER>Harry</PER> had been in very serious trouble then too.
<PER>Snape</PER> had acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind <PER>Snape</PER>'s desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.
“Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> tells me that <PER>Harry</PER> was up by the Shrieking Shack when <PER>Harry</PER> ran into Weasley — apparently alone.” Still, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t speak.
“Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> states that Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing talking to Weasley, when a large amount of mud hit Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the back of the head.
“I don’t know, Professor.” <PER>Snape</PER>’s eyes were boring into <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
“It sounds like <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s having hallucin — ” <PER>Malfoy</PER> is not having hallucinations,” snarled <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> bent down, a hand on each arm of <PER>Harry</PER>’s chair, so that their faces were a foot apart.
<PER>Snape</PER> was trying to provoke <PER>Snape</PER> into telling the truth.
“How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,” <PER>Snape</PER> said suddenly, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes glinting.
“And neither do I.” “Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,” <PER>Snape</PER> went on, pressing <PER>Snape</PER>'s advantage, <PER>Snape</PER>'s thin face full of malice.
“Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter’s delicate ears?” <PER>Harry</PER> bit <PER>Harry</PER>'s lip.
“<PER>Ron</PER> gave them to me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, praying <PER>Harry</PER>’d get a chance to tip <PER>Ron</PER> off before <PER>Snape</PER> saw him.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s face impassive.
<PER>Snape</PER> turned it over, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> clenched <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands to stop them from shaking.
“Professor Severus <PER>Snape</PER>, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!” <PER>Snape</PER> said, hitting the map with <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand.
“Mister Moony presents his compliments to Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people’s business.” <PER>Snape</PER> froze.
“Mister Padfoot would like to register Mister Padfoot's astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.” <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes in horror.
“Mister Wormtail bids Professor <PER>Snape</PER> good day, and advises him to wash him's hair, the slimeball.” <PER>Harry</PER> waited for the blow to fall.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, do you know any of these men?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay — excuse us, Severus — ” <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t dare look at <PER>Snape</PER> as they left <PER>Snape</PER>'s office.
As <PER>Harry</PER> passed the one-eyed witch, he and <PER>Ron</PER> remembered the Invisibility Cloak — it was still down there, but he and <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Ron</PER> didn’t dare go and get it.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart plummeted — had she told Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>?
<PER>Hermione</PER> was holding a letter in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip was trembling.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> “They can’t do this,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, I’m really, really sorry about Scabbers ,” <PER>Hermione</PER> sobbed.
“S’no good, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> sadly as they reached the castle steps.
“And he’s supposed to be our teacher!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both made furious moves toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> got there first — SMACK!
<PER>Hermione</PER> had slapped <PER>Malfoy</PER> across the face with all the strength <PER>Hermione</PER> could muster.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as <PER>Hermione</PER> raised her hand again.
“Don’t you dare call <PER>Hagrid</PER> pathetic, you foul — you evil — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> weakly, and “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” tried to grab her hand as her swung her hand back.
“Get off, <PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>l” <PER>Ron</PER> said again, sounding both stunned and impressed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’d better beat <PER>Harry</PER> in the Quidditch final!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said shrilly.
“You just better had, because I can’t stand it if Slytherin wins!” “We’re due in Charms,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, still goggling at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Come along, quickly, wands out, we’re experimenting with Cheering Charms today, we’ve already divided into pairs — ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags.
“Where’s <PER>Hermione</PER> gone?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around too.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t entered the classroom, yet <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Hermione</PER> had been right next to <PER>Harry</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> had opened the door.
“That’s weird,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> could’ve done with a Cheering Charm on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s too,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly — the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment.
By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had started to get slightly worried.
“You don’t think <PER>Malfoy</PER> did something to <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting at a table, fast asleep, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head resting on an open Arithmancy book.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down together at the same rickety table.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> choked back laughs.
<PER>Harry</PER>, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind empty when thoughts such as “this is stupid” kept drifting across this.
It didn’t help that <PER>Ron</PER> kept breaking into silent giggles and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept tutting.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart sinking.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was coming — “There is something here!” Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering Professor Trelawney's face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in Professor Trelawney's huge glasses.
“Something moving but what is it?” <PER>Harry</PER> was prepared to bet everything <PER>Harry</PER> owned, including <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt, that it wasn’t good news, whatever it was.
Then — “Fine!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag.
“Fine!” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated, swinging the bag over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoulder and almost knocking <PER>Ron</PER> off his chair.
Professor Trelawney turned abruptly from <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s table, breathing rather heavily as Professor Trelawney tugged Professor Trelawney's gauzy shawl more closely to Professor Trelawney.
“Some day <PER>Hermione</PER>’s having, eh?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, looking awed.
<PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom wasn’t the only one.
<PER>Harry</PER>, meanwhile, had to fit in <PER>Harry</PER>'s homework around Quidditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood.
But <PER>Harry</PER> doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as <PER>Harry</PER> did.
The enmity between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> was at its highest point ever.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that <PER>Harry</PER> had somehow wormed <PER>Harry</PER>'s way out of punishment.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t forgotten <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s attempt to sabotage <PER>Harry</PER> in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made <PER>Harry</PER> most determined to beat <PER>Malfoy</PER> in front of the entire school.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip <PER>Harry</PER> up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went, and slouching away looking disappointed when Crabbe and Goyle saw <PER>Harry</PER> surrounded by people.
Wood had given instructions that <PER>Harry</PER> should be accompanied everywhere <PER>Harry</PER> went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action.
The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for <PER>Harry</PER> to get to classes on time because <PER>Harry</PER> was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd.
<PER>Harry</PER> was more concerned for <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt’s safety than <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
When <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t flying it, <PER>Harry</PER> locked it securely in <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still there.
Even <PER>Hermione</PER> had put down Even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s books.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time <PER>Harry</PER> did, <PER>Harry</PER> had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
“You’re going to be fine,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> looked positively terrified.
It was a few seconds before <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that the match hadn’t taken place yet, that <PER>Harry</PER> was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn’t be allowed to play on dragons.
Quietly as <PER>Harry</PER> could, <PER>Harry</PER> got out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s four- poster and went to pour he some water from the silver jug beneath the window.
<PER>Harry</PER> set down <PER>Harry</PER>'s goblet and was about to turn back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed when something caught <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye.
<PER>Harry</PER> dashed to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, snatched up <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window.
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched the window ledge in relief as <PER>Harry</PER> recognized the bottlebrush tail.
<PER>Harry</PER> squinted, pressing <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose flat against the glass.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help grinning broadly as <PER>Harry</PER> saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding them too.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked even paler than usual.
“Good luck, <PER>Harry</PER>!” called <PER>Cho</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> blushing.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered if they were feeling like <PER>Harry</PER> was: as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair fly back off <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead; his nerves left his in the thrill of the flight; his glanced around, saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.
He had seen the Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts — but He mustn’t catch it yet — and if <PER>Malfoy</PER> saw it — Faking a look of sudden concentration, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end — it worked.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> went haring after <PER>Harry</PER>, clearly thinking <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the Snitch there.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward <PER>Harry</PER>, clubs raised — <PER>Harry</PER> turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was still keeping close to <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> soared over the match, looking around for it — once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead — Katie scored.
<PER>Harry</PER> could almost feel hundreds of eyes following <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with <PER>Malfoy</PER> speeding along behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears; <PER>Harry</PER> stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down — Horrified, he looked around.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> had thrown <PER>Malfoy</PER> forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt’s tail, and was pulling it back.
“You — ” <PER>Harry</PER> was angry enough to hit <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but couldn’t reach — <PER>Malfoy</PER> was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes were sparkling maliciously.
“YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B — ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> didn’t even bother to tell Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> off.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was actually shaking Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s finger in <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s direction, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s hat had fallen off, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> too was shouting furiously.
The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s foul on <PER>Harry</PER>, were being spurred on to greater heights.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t going to let <PER>Malfoy</PER> anywhere near the Snitch.
“Get out of it, Potter!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found <PER>Harry</PER> blocking him.
Every single Slytherin player apart from <PER>Malfoy</PER> was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — <PER>Harry</PER> wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low <PER>Harry</PER> was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was diving, a look of triumph on his face — there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer — <PER>Harry</PER> urged the Firebolt downward, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> was miles ahead — “Go!
He was gaining on <PER>Malfoy</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> flattened He to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at He — He was at <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s ankles — He was level — <PER>Harry</PER> threw — <PER>Harry</PER> forward, took both hands off — <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
<PER>Harry</PER> soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; him seized <PER>Harry</PER> around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on <PER>Harry</PER>.
Thrust into the light, he saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>, plastered with crimson rosettes — “Yeh beat ’em, <PER>Harry</PER>, Yeh beat ’em!
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way toward <PER>Harry</PER>, were <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
them simply beamed as <PER>Harry</PER> was borne toward the stands, where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.
As a sobbing Wood passed <PER>Harry</PER> the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> could have produced the world’s best Patronus.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had given up asking her how her was managing to attend several classes at once, but they couldn’t restrain they when they saw the exam schedule her had drawn up for her.
The first column read: Monday 9 o’clock, Arithmancy 9 o’clock, Transfiguration Lunch 1 o’clock, Charms 1 o’clock, Ancient Runes “<PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days.
<PER>Hermione</PER> started shifting heaps of parchment around on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s table, looking for the book.
“It’s from <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ripping the note open.
“I’ve spent ages reading up on stuff for him; they can’t just ignore it all!” But <PER>Harry</PER> had a horrible feeling that the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had had its mind made up for it by Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
From sneering comments <PER>Harry</PER> overheard, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was certain Buckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed thoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about.
It was all <PER>Harry</PER> could do to stop <PER>Harry</PER> imitating <PER>Hermione</PER> and hitting <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the face on these occasions.
And the worst thing of all was that they had no time or opportunity to go and see <PER>Hagrid</PER>, because the strict new security measures had not been lifted, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t dare retrieve <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak from below the one-eyed witch.
<PER>Hermione</PER> irritated the rest by fussing about how <PER>Hermione</PER>'s tortoise had looked more like a turtle, which was the least of everyone else’s worries.
<PER>Harry</PER> slightly overdid <PER>Harry</PER>'s out of nerves and <PER>Ron</PER>, who was partnering him, ended up in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to perform the charm himself.
As flobberworms flourished best if left to their own devices, it was the easiest exam any of them had ever taken, and also gave <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> plenty of opportunity to speak to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> told them, bending low on the pretense of checking that <PER>Harry</PER>’s flobberworm was still alive.
Try as <PER>Harry</PER> might, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t get <PER>Harry</PER>'s Confusing Concoction to thicken, and <PER>Snape</PER>, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away.
Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which <PER>Harry</PER> scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told <PER>Harry</PER> about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing <PER>Harry</PER> could have had one of Fortescue ’s choco- nut sundaes with <PER>Harry</PER> in the stifling classroom.
“Excellent, <PER>Harry</PER>,” Lupin muttered as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed out of the trunk, grinning.
“Full marks.” Flushed with his success, <PER>Harry</PER> hung around to watch <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> did everything perfectly until <PER>Hermione</PER> reached the trunk with the boggart in it.
“What’s the matter?” “P — P — Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, pointing into the trunk.
“Sh — <PER>Hermione</PER> said I’d failed everything!” It took a little while to calm — <PER>Hermione</PER> down.
When at last — <PER>Hermione</PER> had regained a grip on — <PER>Hermione</PER>, — <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> went back to the castle.
<PER>Ron</PER> was still slightly inclined to laugh at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.
<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge, sweating slightly in <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge's pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.
<PER>Harry</PER> gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard squinted toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin and said in a feeble voice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this.
<PER>Ron</PER> opened his mouth to say something, but <PER>Hermione</PER> nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head toward the entrance hall.
All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate people's lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, lost in worry about <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Buckbeak, didn’t join in.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s last exam was Divination; <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, Muggle Studies.
They walked up the marble staircase together; <PER>Hermione</PER> left They on the first floor and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> proceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney’s classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute studying.
“she says the crystal ball’s told shis that if I tell you, I’ll have a horrible accident!” squeaked <PER>Neville</PER> as he clambered back down the ladder toward <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had now reached the landing.
“You know, I’m starting to think <PER>Hermione</PER> was right about <PER>Hermione</PER>” — he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead — “<PER>Hermione</PER>’s a right old fraud.” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own watch.
“She says I’ve got all the makings of a true Seer,” She informed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> grimaced at <PER>Harry</PER> and climbed the silver ladder out of sight.
<PER>Harry</PER> settled <PER>Harry</PER> on the floor with <PER>Harry</PER>'s back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind across the grounds with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Think, now ” <PER>Harry</PER> cast <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.
Over in the corner, however, sat <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s just sent this.” <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as his wrote that it was hardly legible.
I don’t want you to see it <PER>Hagrid</PER> “We’ve got to go,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
“<PER>Harry</PER> can’t just sit there on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, waiting for the executioner!” “Sunset, though,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was staring out the window in a glazed sort of way.
if <PER>Snape</PER> sees me anywhere near there again, I’m in serious trouble,” <PER>Snape</PER> finished.
“That’s true,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, getting to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet.
“But — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t wait for the rest of his sentence; <PER>Hermione</PER> strode across the room, pushed open the Fat Lady’s portrait and vanished from sight.
<PER>Hermione</PER> returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I don’t know what’s gotten into you lately!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, astounded.
“First you hit <PER>Malfoy</PER>, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather flattered.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the cloak hidden down the front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes; <PER>Harry</PER> had to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms folded to hide the lump.
<PER>Hermione</PER> poked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head around the door.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s was a minute in answering, and when <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s did, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s looked all around for <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's visitor, pale-faced and trembling.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> shut the door quickly and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the cloak.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was not crying, nor did <PER>Harry</PER> throw <PER>Harry</PER> upon their necks.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked like a man who did not know where <PER>Harry</PER> was or what to do.
“Where’s Buckbeak, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hesitantly.
“I’ll do it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked back hopelessly.
“Isn’t there anything anyone can do, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked fiercely, sitting down next to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> “He’s tried,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Well stay with you too, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” she began, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> shook his shaggy head.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt strangely unreal, and even more so when <PER>Harry</PER> saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree behind <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s pumpkin patch.
“It’s okay ” He turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, we can’t — ” “Well tell them what really happened — ” “them can’t kill him — ” “Go!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> fiercely.
As <PER>Hermione</PER> threw the cloak over <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, they heard voices at the front of the cabin.
Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off silently around <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house.
“Oh, please, <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
“It’s Scabbers — he won’t — stay put — ” <PER>Ron</PER> was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink the rat's teeth into <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand.
“Scabbers, it’s me, you idiot, it<PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed.
“Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, please let’s move, they’re going to do it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> breathed.
“Okay — Scabbers, stay put — ” They walked forward; <PER>Harry</PER>, like <PER>Hermione</PER>, was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them.
“They did it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
Without thinking about what he was doing, he made to turn back, but both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seized his arms.
“What’s the matter with him?” But <PER>Harry</PER> had just seen — slinking toward them, <PER>Harry</PER>'s body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness — Crookshanks.
In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him, and before <PER>Harry</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> could stop him, <PER>Ron</PER> had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.
“<PER>Ron</PER>\” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the cloak; <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> hurtled after <PER>Ron</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.
“Gotchal Get off, you stinking cat — ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> almost fell over <PER>Ron</PER>; they skidded to a stop right in front of him.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — come on — back under the cloak — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> panted.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached for <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, but too late — the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; him keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; him felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth — But the force of its leap had carried the force of its leap too far; the force of its leap rolled off him.
Dazed, feeling as though him's ribs were broken, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to stand up; <PER>Harry</PER> could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.
As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed <PER>Harry</PER> aside; the dog’s jaws fastened instead around <PER>Ron</PER>’s outstretched arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> lunged forward, <PER>Harry</PER> seized a handful of the brute’s hair, but it was dragging <PER>Ron</PER> away as easily as though <PER>Harry</PER> were a rag doll — Then, out of nowhere, something hit <PER>Harry</PER> so hard across the face <PER>Harry</PER> was knocked off <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet again.
<PER>Harry</PER> groped for <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, blinking blood out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes — “Lumos\” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging <PER>Ron</PER> backward into a large gap in the roots — <PER>Ron</PER> was fighting furiously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight — “<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and <PER>Harry</PER> was forced backward again.
All they could see now was one of <PER>Ron</PER>’s legs, which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground — but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg had broken, and a moment later, <PER>Ron</PER>’s's foot vanished from sight.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — we’ve got to go for help — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped; she was bleeding too; the Willow had cut shis across the shoulder.
“If that dog can get in, we can,” <PER>Harry</PER> panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree’s blows.
<PER>Hermione</PER> now grasped <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm painfully hard.
<PER>Harry</PER> went next; <PER>Harry</PER> crawled forward, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel.
All <PER>Harry</PER> could think of was <PER>Ron</PER> and what the enormous dog might be doing to him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> paused, gasping for breath, edging forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked very frightened but nodded.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> out of the hole, staring around.
<PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm again.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” she whispered, “I think we’re in the Shrieking Shack.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s grip on <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm was so tight <PER>Harry</PER> was losing feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> dashed across to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — are you okay?” “Where’s the dog?” “Not a dog,” <PER>Ron</PER> moaned.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped in a petrified whisper; <PER>Ron</PER>, however, spoke to Black.
“You will damage that leg even more.” “Did you hear me?” <PER>Ron</PER> said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to <PER>Harry</PER> to stay upright.
“Why’s that?” <PER>Harry</PER> spat, trying to wrench himself free of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Be quiet!” “HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!” <PER>Harry</PER> roared, and with a huge effort <PER>Harry</PER> broke free of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s restraint and lunged forward — <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten about magic — <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten that <PER>Harry</PER> was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man — all <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that all <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to hurt Black as badly as all <PER>Harry</PER> could and that all <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t care how much all <PER>Harry</PER> got hurt in return — Perhaps it was the shock of <PER>Harry</PER> doing something so stupid, but Black didn’t raise the wands in time — one of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hands fastened over <PER>Harry</PER>'s wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of <PER>Harry</PER>’s other hand collided with the side of Black’s head and they fell, backward, into the wall — <PER>Hermione</PER> was screaming; <PER>Ron</PER> was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black’s hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed <PER>Harry</PER>’s face by inches; <PER>Harry</PER> felt the shrunken arm under <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers twisting madly, but <PER>Harry</PER> clung on, <PER>Harry</PER>'s other hand punching every part of Black it could find.
But Black’s free hand had found <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat — “No,” he hissed, “I’ve waited too long — ” The fingers tightened, <PER>Harry</PER> choked, <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses askew.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s foot swing out of nowhere.
Black let go of <PER>Harry</PER> with a grunt of pain; <PER>Ron</PER> had thrown himself on Black’s wand hand and <PER>Harry</PER> heard a faint clatter — himself fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw himself's own wand rolling across the floor; himself threw himself toward it but — “Argh!” Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm; <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> off, but Crookshanks now darted toward <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand — “NO YOU DONT!” roared <PER>Harry</PER>, and YOU DONT!” aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; <PER>Harry</PER> snatched up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and turned — “Get out of the way!” he shouted at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, gasping for breath, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s wands.
Black thin chest rose and fell rapidly as Black watched <PER>Harry</PER> walking slowly nearer, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand pointing straight at Black’s heart.
“Going to kill me, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped right above him, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand still pointing at Black’s chest, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But if you knew the whole story.” “The whole story?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, a furious pounding in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
He turned He's ugly, squashed face to <PER>Harry</PER> and looked up at <PER>Harry</PER> with those great yellow eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared down at Black and Crookshanks, <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip tightening on the wand.
And still <PER>Harry</PER> stood frozen there, wand poised, Black staring up at <PER>Harry</PER>, Crookshanks on his chest.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s ragged breathing came from near the bed; <PER>Hermione</PER> was quite silent.
“WE’RE UP HERE — SIRIUS BLACK — QUICK!” Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; <PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand convulsively — Do it nouA said a voice in nouA's head — but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and <PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t done it.
His eyes flickered over <PER>Ron</PER>, lying on the floor, over <PER>Hermione</PER>, cowering next to the door, to <PER>Harry</PER>, standing there with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand covering Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and bleeding at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet.
Mystified, <PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked bewildered.
“Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> interrupted loudly, “what’s going on — ?” But <PER>Harry</PER> never finished the question, because what <PER>Harry</PER> saw made <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice die in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the bottom had dropped out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
“You — you — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER> — ” “ — you and him!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, calm down — ” “I didn’t tell anyone!” <PER>Hermione</PER> shrieked.
“I can explain — ” <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER> shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of fury.
“I trusted you,” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted at Lupin, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice wavering out of control, “and all the time you’ve been <PER>Harry</PER>'s friend!” “You’re wrong,” said Lupin.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, don’t trust <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s been helping Black get into the castle, <PER>Harry</PER> wants you dead too — <PER>Harry</PER>’s a werewolf.” There was a ringing silence.
Then, with an obvious effort, him turned to <PER>Hermione</PER> and said, “How long have you known?” “Ages,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “I’m not,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“At least, the staff do.” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> hired you when “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew you were a werewolf?” <PER>Ron</PER> gasped.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> voiced what <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking.
“Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.” “Peter’S NOT PETER, Peter’S SCABBERS!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting too hard; <PER>Ron</PER> swayed and overbalanced, and <PER>Harry</PER> caught him and pushed him back down to the bed.
“Right again, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER>!
<PER>Ron</PER> started to interrupt, but <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Shh!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was watching Lupin very intently.
“He’s teaching here as well.” He looked up at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Severus <PER>Snape</PER> was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, Severus <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand pointing directly at Lupin.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d received a huge electric shock.
“You haven’t heard everything — I can explain — Sirius is not here to kill <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “Two more for Azkaban tonight,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, his eyes now gleaming fanatically.
With a roar of rage, Black started toward <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Snape</PER> pointed <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand straight between Black’s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, took an uncertain step toward <PER>Snape</PER> and said, in a very breathless voice, “Professor <PER>Snape</PER> — it — it wouldn’t hurt to hear what they’ve got to say, w — would it?” “Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,” <PER>Snape</PER> spat.
“The rat — look at the rat — ” But there was a mad glint in <PER>Snape</PER> ’s eyes that <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen before.
<PER>Harry</PER> clicked <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands.
Before <PER>Snape</PER> could take even one step toward him, <PER>Snape</PER> had raised <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand.
There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; <PER>Snape</PER> was lifted off <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under <PER>Snape</PER>'s hair.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had tried to disarm <PER>Snape</PER> at exactly the same moment.
It was the photograph of <PER>Ron</PER> and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on <PER>Ron</PER>’s shoulder, was Scabbers.
Scabbers had been looking ill before <PER>Harry</PER> met Crookshanks ever since <PER>Ron</PER>’s return from Egypt since the time when Black had escaped.
“Then I should’ve let <PER>Snape</PER> take you!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“<PER>Harry</PER> WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER!
“<PER>Harry</PER> I as good as killed them,” <PER>Harry</PER> croaked.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and <PER>Snape</PER>’s's wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in <PER>Snape</PER>'s face.
He was a very short man, hardly taller than <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes dart to the door and back again.
“I’d like to clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if you’d be so — ” “He’s come to try and kill me again!” Pettigrew squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> used <PER>Harry</PER>'s middle finger, because <PER>Harry</PER>'s index was missing.
“If <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s supporters were after me, it was because I put one of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s supporters's best men in Azkaban — the spy, Sirius Black!” Black’s face contorted.
Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though he had never seen anything quite like <PER>Hermione</PER>.
If he gave them <PER>Harry</PER>, who’d dare say he’d betrayed Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?
“No!” Pettigrew had fallen to Pettigrew's knees as though <PER>Harry</PER>’s nod had been <PER>Harry</PER>'s own death sentence.
<PER>Harry</PER> shuffled forward on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, groveling, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands clasped in front of him as though praying.
“<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> you look just like your father just like <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran forward, placing <PER>Harry</PER> in front of Pettigrew, facing the wands.
“Stand aside, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, I can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.” He hurried over to <PER>Ron</PER>, bent down, tapped <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg with his wand, and muttered, “Ferula.” Bandages spun up <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.
“Thanks.” “What about Professor <PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a small voice, looking down at Professor <PER>Snape</PER>’s prone figure.
“There’s nothing seriously wrong with him,” said Lupin, bending over Professor <PER>Snape</PER> and checking Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s pulse.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> brought up the rear.
<PER>Harry</PER> went right after Black, who was still making <PER>Snape</PER> drift along ahead of them; <PER>Harry</PER> kept bumping <PER>Harry</PER>'s lolling head on the low ceiling.
Did Black mean what <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> meant?
“I understand, I just thought I’d — ” “Are you insane?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice easily as croaky as Black’s.
Black saw <PER>Snape</PER> up through the hole, then stood back for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to pass.
What would happen when <PER>Harry</PER> told the Dursleys <PER>Harry</PER> was going to live with the convict they’d seen on television !
<PER>Snape</PER> was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black, <PER>Snape</PER>'s chin bumping on <PER>Snape</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Snape</PER> collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had stopped abruptly.
He flung out one arm to make <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stop.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s bald tail whip through the manacle on <PER>Ron</PER>’s outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass.
There was a howl and a rumbling growl; <PER>Harry</PER> turned to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into the forest — “Sirius, <PER>Harry</PER>’s gone, Pettigrew transformed!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at <PER>Harry</PER>’s words <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of <PER>Harry</PER>'s paws faded to silence as <PER>Harry</PER> pounded away across the grounds.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> dashed over to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s eyes were only half-closed, <PER>Ron</PER>’s's mouth hung open; <PER>Ron</PER>’s was definitely alive, they could hear <PER>Ron</PER>’s breathing, but <PER>Ron</PER>’s didn’t seem to recognize they.
“We’d better get them up to the castle and tell someone,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pushing <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, trying to think straight.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a moment’s indecision, but there was nothing they could do for <PER>Ron</PER> at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble — <PER>Harry</PER> set off at a run, <PER>Hermione</PER> right behind him.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, think of something happy!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, blinking furiously to try and clear <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it — I’m going to live with my godfather.
At the same moment, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Hermione</PER> collapse next to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Expecto — expecto patronum — ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees hit the cold grass.
A paralyzing terror filled <PER>Harry</PER> so that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t move or speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> mother was screaming in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
With every ounce of strength he could muster, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the lake.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to pat it someone who looked strangely familiar but it couldn’t be <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t understand.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt the last of <PER>Harry</PER>'s strength leave <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s head hit the ground as He fainted.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s brain seemed to be moving a little faster, and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved <PER>Harry</PER>'s head over on the pillow.
It was ajar, and the voices of <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge and <PER>Snape</PER> were coming through it from the corridor outside.
she placed the chocolate on <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedside table and began breaking the chocolate on <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedside table apart with a small hammer.
“How’s <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“As for you two you’ll be staying here until I’m satisfied you’re — Potter, what do you think you’re doing?” <PER>Harry</PER> was sitting up, putting <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses back on, and picking up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
But his shout had been heard in the corridor outside; next second, <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge and <PER>Snape</PER> had entered the ward.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, what’s this?” said Fudge, looking agitated.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, you’re very confused, you’ve been through a dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now, we’ve got everything under control.
“YOU VE GOT THE WRONG MAN!” “Minister, listen, please,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said; <PER>Hermione</PER> had hurried to <PER>Harry</PER>’s side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge’s face.
“If they’d just listen But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth; <PER>Harry</PER> choked, and Madam Pomfrey seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> swallowed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again.
“Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive — ” “That, indeed, is Black’s story,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, surveying <PER>Snape</PER> closely through <PER>Snape</PER>'s half-moon spectacles.
“You didn’t arrive in time to hear — ” “Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!” “Now, <PER>Snape</PER>,” said Fudge, startled, “the young lady is disturbed in the young lady's mind, we must make allowances — ” “I would like to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> abruptly.
“<PER>Cornelius</PER>, Severus, Poppy — please leave us.” “Headmaster!” sputtered Madam Pomfrey “They need treatment, They need rest — ” “This cannot wait,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“You surely don’t believe a word of Black’s story?” <PER>Snape</PER> whispered, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes fixed on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face.
“I wish to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> repeated.
<PER>Snape</PER> took a step toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> turned on <PER>Snape</PER>'s heel and marched through the door Fudge was still holding.
It closed behind them, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Professor, Black’s telling the truth — we saw Pettigrew — ” “ — he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf — ” “ — he’s a rat — ” “ — Pettigrew’s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off “ — Pettigrew attacked <PER>Ron</PER>, it wasn’t Sirius — ” But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> held up <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand to stem the flood of explanations.
“What we need,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> slowly, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s light blue eyes moved from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “is more time.” “But — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had turned on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s heel and looked back as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reached the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the sensation that <PER>Harry</PER> was flying very fast, backward.
A blur of colors and shapes rushed past <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears were pounding, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to yell but couldn’t hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s own voice — And then <PER>Harry</PER> felt solid ground beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, and everything came into focus again — his was standing next to <PER>Hermione</PER> in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, what — ?” “In here!” <PER>Hermione</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and dragged <PER>Harry</PER> across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed <PER>Harry</PER> inside among the buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them.
“What — how — <PER>Hermione</PER>, what happened?” “We’ve gone back in time,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, lifting the chain off <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck in the darkness.
“Three hours back ” <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s own leg and gave his own leg a very hard pinch.
“Footsteps across the hall yes, I think it’s us going down to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s!” “Are you telling me,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, “that we’re here in this cupboard and we’re out there too?” “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her ear still glued to the cupboard door.
“Where did you get that hourglass thing?” “It’s called a Time-Turner,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, “and I got it from Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> on our first day back.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, we’re going to save Buckbeak!” “But — how will that help Sirius?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said — ““<PER>Dumbledore</PER> just told us where the window is — the window of Flitwick’s office!
<PER>Harry</PER> stood up and pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear against the door.
Safe in the shadows of the trees, <PER>Harry</PER> turned around; seconds later, <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived beside <PER>Harry</PER>, panting.
And <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Harry</PER>'s own voice.
“That’s <PER>Hagrid</PER> breaking the milk jug,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
And sure enough, moments later, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s back door opened, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw himself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> walking out of it with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Then he turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched the grass flatten in patches all around <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone but the <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s head out of sight as Macnair’s face appeared at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s window, staring out at Buckbeak.
“Wait here,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’ll do it.” As Fudge’s voice started again, <PER>Harry</PER> darted out from behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.
” <PER>Harry</PER> threw all <PER>Harry</PER>'s weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in <PER>Harry</PER>'s front feet.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, hurry!” <PER>Hermione</PER> mouthed.
<PER>Harry</PER> could still hear <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s voice talking from within the cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn’t see <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s garden at all.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
And then came the howling, and this time they could hear <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s words through <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s's sobs.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> tightened <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s grip and dug <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s heels into the forest floor to stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
“There’s <PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched himself and <PER>Hermione</PER> chasing after <PER>Ron</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> dive.
They saw him bowl <PER>Harry</PER> over, then seize <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching the dog pulling <PER>Ron</PER> into the roots.
“If only <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had come with us ” “Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, <PER>Snape</PER>’d never be able to get it and — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, we mustn’t be seen!” “How can you stand this?” he asked <PER>Hermione</PER> fiercely.
“I’m going to grab the cloak!” “<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” <PER>Hermione</PER> seized the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes not a moment too soon.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s fists clenched as they watched <PER>Snape</PER> skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s mouth was slightly open by the time <PER>Harry</PER> had finished.
“I think it was my dad.” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced up at <PER>Hermione</PER> and saw that <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth was fully open now.
“You think you saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s ghost?” “I don’t know no <PER>Harry</PER> looked solid.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to look at Buckbeak, who was digging <PER>Harry</PER>'s beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms.
<PER>Harry</PER> was thinking about <PER>Harry</PER>'s father and about <PER>Harry</PER>'s father’s three oldest friends Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sat with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face turned toward the Willow, waiting.
She and <PER>Harry</PER> got to She and <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
They saw Lupin, Pettigrew, and <PER>Ron</PER> clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots followed by the unconscious <PER>Snape</PER>, drifting weirdly upward.
Next came <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Black.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> muttered as though she knew exactly what <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking, “we’ve got to stay put.
“He’s transforming — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly.
The cabin was in sight; <PER>Harry</PER> skidded to the door, wrenched the door open, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and Buckbeak flashed past him; <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> in after them and bolted the door.
“But if we don’t see what’s going on, how’re we going to know when it’s time to rescue Sirius?” “Well okay, then I’ll wait here with Buckbeak but <PER>Harry</PER>, be careful — there’s a werewolf out there — and the dementors — ” <PER>Harry</PER> stepped outside again and edged around the cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared out toward the lake, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart doing a kind of drumroll in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no thought in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head except his father.
<PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> behind it, peering desperately through the leaves.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake.
him hadn’t seen him's father — him had seen him — <PER>Harry</PER> flung — <PER>Harry</PER> out from behind the bush and pulled out — <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
And <PER>Harry</PER> realized “Prongs,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
Then, with a great leap of <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart, <PER>Harry</PER> heard hooves behind <PER>Harry</PER> — his whirled around and saw <PER>Hermione</PER> dashing toward <PER>Harry</PER>, dragging Buckbeak behind <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Get behind here — behind this bush — I’ll explain.” <PER>Hermione</PER> listened to what had just happened with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth open yet again.
<PER>Snape</PER> was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Black onto them.
“Right, it’s nearly time,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tensely, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch.
<PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s flanks with <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was holding <PER>Harry</PER> very tight around the waist; <PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Hermione</PER>'s muttering, “Oh, no — I don’t like this — oh, I really don’t like this — ” <PER>Harry</PER> urged Buckbeak forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> was trying to count the windows flashing past — “Whoa!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, pulling backward as hard as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s jaw drop.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt from <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair, hurried to the window and tried to open the window, but the window was locked.
“Stand back!” <PER>Hermione</PER> called to him, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, still gripping the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes with her left hand.
“Get on — there’s not much time,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, gripping Buckbeak firmly on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleek neck to hold <PER>Harry</PER> steady.
Buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> slid off <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was tugging at his sleeve, staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch.
“We’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing We — before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> locks the door — ” “Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wrenching <PER>Harry</PER>'s gaze from the sky, “let’s go.
only hope <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s not going to make difficulties,” <PER>Snape</PER> was saying.
He caught a glimpse of <PER>Snape</PER>’s smirk as He and Fudge passed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hiding place.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> waited a few moments to make sure <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’d really gone, then started to run in the opposite direction.
“Peeves\” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, grabbing <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wrist.
“Oh, his’s horrible,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s ear to the door.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back inside — before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> locks the door?” <PER>Harry</PER> panted.
“I don’t want to think about it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned, checking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch again.
“Okay — I can hear <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tensely.
Panicking, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ran forward.
“Yes, I think you’ve gone too — get inside — I’ll lock you in — ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> slipped back inside the dormitory.
As the lock clicked behind them, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> crept back to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own beds, <PER>Hermione</PER> tucking the Time-Turner back under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> thought it best to accept <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s chocolate quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waiting, listening, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s nerves jangling.
Fudge, <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> came striding into the ward.
Indeed, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> alone looked as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> alone was quite enjoying <PER>Dumbledore</PER> alone.
But <PER>Snape</PER> was beside <PER>Snape</PER>.
“This door’s been locked, we just saw — ” “THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” <PER>Snape</PER> howled, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> face was twisted; spit was flying from <PER>Snape</PER>'s mouth.
“Unless you are suggesting that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> are able to be in two places at once, I’m afraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further.” <PER>Snape</PER> stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly shocked at <PER>Snape</PER>'s behavior, to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, whose eyes were twinkling behind <PER>Snape</PER>'s glasses.
“I’d watch out for Fellow if I were you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
“You explain,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, helping <PER>Harry</PER> to some more chocolate.
When <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the hospital wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost deserted castle.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> felt like going, however, so they and <PER>Harry</PER> wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now.
Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, <PER>Harry</PER> lost the thread of the conversation as <PER>Harry</PER> looked across to the opposite bank.
A shadow fell across them and them looked up to see a very bleary-eyed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, mopping a very bleary-eyed <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s sweaty face with one of a very bleary-eyed <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them.
“Why?” “Leavin’, isn’ he?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking surprised that <PER>Harry</PER> had to ask.
“I’m going to see him,” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I just saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then, while <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to think of a good argument to make <PER>Harry</PER> stay, Lupin said, “From what the headmaster told me this morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t look surprised to see <PER>Harry</PER> there.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down in <PER>Harry</PER>'s vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor.
“Why so miserable, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very — very strange.” “Indeed?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Er — stranger than usual, you mean?” “Yes her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said she said <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s servant was going to set out to return to <PER>Voldemort</PER> before midnight.
“Do you know, <PER>Harry</PER>, I think she might have been,” <PER>Harry</PER> said thoughtfully.
“<PER>Harry</PER> betrayed my parents!” “This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew what <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking.
“your father would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t laugh <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> “I thought it was my dad who’d conjured my Patronus.
Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The whole of <PER>Harry</PER>’s Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about <PER>Harry</PER>'s resignation.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether <PER>Harry</PER> had sought sanctuary with <PER>Voldemort</PER> yet.
And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news, because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help feeling miserable when <PER>Harry</PER> thought of the home <PER>Harry</PER> might have had, and the fact that it was now impossible.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had passed every subject.
<PER>Harry</PER> was amazed that <PER>Harry</PER> had got through Potions.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a shrewd suspicion that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might have stepped in to stop <PER>Snape</PER> failing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on purpose.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s behavior toward <PER>Harry</PER> over the past week had been quite alarming.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have thought it possible that <PER>Snape</PER>’s dislike for <PER>Harry</PER> could increase, but it certainly had.
A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of <PER>Snape</PER>’s thin mouth every time he looked at <PER>Harry</PER>, and he was constantly flexing his fingers, as though itching to place them around <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat.
Even <PER>Harry</PER> managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the next day as <PER>Harry</PER> ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next morning, <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> some surprising news.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain.
“Oh, cheer up, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sadly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly, peering over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly pulled down the window, stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm, and caught the window.
<PER>Harry</PER> ripped open the letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!” “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> excitedly.
“That’ll be good enough for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> happily.
he looked closely at the owl for a moment; then, to <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s great surprise, he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff.
It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three-quarters.
“I’ll call about the World Cup!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled after <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> bid him and <PER>Hermione</PER> good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing him's trunk and Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in him's usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope <PER>Harry</PER> was still clutching in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the <PER>Riddle</PER> House,” even though it had been many years since the <PER>Riddle</PER> family had lived there.
Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer’s morning, when the <PER>Riddle</PER> House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three <PER>Riddle</PER>s dead.
Elderly Mister and Mistress <PER>Riddle</PER> had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and Elderly Mister and Mistress <PER>Riddle</PER>'s grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse.
The wealthy man who owned the <PER>Riddle</PER> House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; The wealthy man who owned the <PER>Riddle</PER> House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use said in the village that he kept it for “tax reasons,” though nobody was very clear what these might be.
Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, him looked up at the <PER>Riddle</PER> House and saw lights glimmering in the <PER>Riddle</PER> House upper windows.
“It could be done without <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, My Lord.” Another pause, more protracted, and then — “Without <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” breathed the second voice softly.
my faithful servant at Hogwarts <PER>Harry</PER> Potter started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; my faithful servant at Hogwarts <PER>Harry</PER> Potter was hissing and spitting without drawing breath.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, breathing hard as though <PER>Harry</PER> had been running.
<PER>Harry</PER> had awoken from a vivid dream with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands pressed over <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers over the scar again.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to recall what <PER>Harry</PER> had been dreaming about before <PER>Harry</PER> had awoken.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach at the very thought.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes tightly and tried to remember what <PER>Voldemort</PER> had looked like, but it was impossible.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that at the moment when <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s chair had swung around, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, had seen what was sitting in it, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had felt a spasm of horror, which had awoken <PER>Voldemort</PER> or had that been the pain in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar?
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s face into <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, blocking out <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in <PER>Harry</PER>'s cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to hold on to them.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though <PER>Harry</PER> could not remember the name and they had been plotting to kill someone else him).
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s face out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, and stared around <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there.
On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; <PER>Harry</PER> had been reading it before <PER>Harry</PER> fell asleep last night.
Even Quidditch — in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion, the best sport in the world — couldn’t distract <PER>Harry</PER> at the moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> placed Flying with the Cannons on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey the street below.
And yet and yet <PER>Harry</PER> went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on the bed, running a finger over <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had lost all the bones from <PER>Harry</PER>'s right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night.
No, the thing that was bothering <PER>Harry</PER> was that the last time <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar had hurt <PER>Harry</PER>, it had been because <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been close by.
<PER>Harry</PER> listened closely to the silence around <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER> mentally; <PER>Harry</PER> was being stupid.
There was no one in the house with <PER>Harry</PER> except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and <PER>Dudley</PER>, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.
Asleep was the way <PER>Harry</PER> liked the Dursleys best; it wasn’t as though they were ever any help to <PER>Harry</PER> awake.
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and <PER>Dudley</PER> were <PER>Harry</PER>’s only living relatives.
They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but They were still apt to blame <PER>Harry</PER> for anything that went wrong about the house.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about <PER>Harry</PER>'s life in the wizarding world.
And yet it was because of <PER>Voldemort</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had come to live with the Dursleys in the first place.
If it hadn’t been for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> would not have had the lightning scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
If it hadn’t been for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> would still have had parents.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been a year old the night that <PER>Voldemort</PER> — the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years — arrived at <PER>Harry</PER>'s house and killed <PER>Harry</PER>'s father and mother.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had then turned <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand on <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Voldemort</PER> had performed the curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s steady rise to power — and, incredibly, it had not worked.
<PER>Harry</PER> had survived with nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been reduced to something barely alive.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> powers gone, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s life almost extinguished, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s followers had disbanded, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter had become famous.
It had been enough of a shock for <PER>Harry</PER> to discover, on <PER>Harry</PER>'s eleventh birthday, that <PER>Harry</PER> was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name.
<PER>Harry</PER> had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed <PER>Harry</PER> wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was used to it now: At the end of this summer, <PER>Harry</PER> would be starting <PER>Harry</PER>'s fourth year at Hogwarts, and <PER>Harry</PER> was already counting the days until <PER>Harry</PER> would be back at the castle again.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked hopelessly around <PER>Harry</PER>'s room again, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye paused on the birthday cards <PER>Harry</PER>'s two best friends had sent <PER>Harry</PER> at the end of July.
What would they say if <PER>Harry</PER> wrote to they and told they about <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar hurting?
<PER>Harry</PER> doubted very much whether a book could help <PER>Harry</PER> now.
As far as <PER>Harry</PER> knew, <PER>Harry</PER> was the only living person to have survived a curse like <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that <PER>Voldemort</PER> would find <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.
As for informing the headmaster, <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> went during the summer holidays.
<PER>Harry</PER> amused <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, picturing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s long silver beard, full-length wizard’s robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose.
Wherever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was, though, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that Hedwig would be able to find <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER>’s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address.
And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, <PER>Ron</PER> Weasley’s, reaction, and in a moment, <PER>Ron</PER>’s red hair and long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before <PER>Harry</PER>, wearing a bemused expression.
In any case, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, was getting jumpy about a few moments’ pain.
Mistress Weasley would fuss worse than <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Fred and George, <PER>Ron</PER>’s sixteen-year-old twin brothers, might think <PER>Harry</PER> was losing his nerve.
The Weasleys were <PER>Harry</PER>’s favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite he to stay any time now (<PER>Ron</PER> had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn’t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.
<PER>Harry</PER> kneaded <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead with <PER>Harry</PER>'s knuckles.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk; <PER>Harry</PER> pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded <PER>Harry</PER>'s eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase <PER>Harry</PER>'s problem, still marveling at the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t thought of Dear Sirius straight away.
But then, perhaps it wasn’t so surprising — after all, <PER>Harry</PER> had only found out that Dear Sirius was <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather two months ago.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> knew otherwise, however; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had believed their story.
For one glorious hour, <PER>Harry</PER> had believed that <PER>Harry</PER> was leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered <PER>Harry</PER> a home once <PER>Harry</PER>'s name had been cleared.
But the chance had been snatched away from <PER>Harry</PER> — Wormtail had escaped before they could take <PER>Harry</PER> to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> had helped <PER>Harry</PER> escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run.
Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to <PER>Harry</PER>, even if <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t be with <PER>Harry</PER>.
It was due to Sirius that <PER>Harry</PER> now had all <PER>Harry</PER>'s school things in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom with <PER>Harry</PER>.
The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of keeping <PER>Harry</PER> as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of <PER>Harry</PER>'s powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this.
But them's attitude had changed since them had found out that <PER>Harry</PER> had a dangerous murderer for a godfather — for <PER>Harry</PER> had conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.
<PER>Harry</PER> had received two letters from Sirius since <PER>Harry</PER> had been back at Privet Drive.
<PER>Harry</PER>, on the other hand, had liked them; them put <PER>Harry</PER> in mind of palm trees and white sand, and <PER>Harry</PER> hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), <PER>Harry</PER> was enjoying <PER>Harry</PER>.
Sirius’s letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed, sounded cheerful, and in both of them <PER>Harry</PER> had reminded <PER>Harry</PER> to call on <PER>Harry</PER> if ever <PER>Harry</PER> needed to.
Finally, when the sun had risen, when <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia’s room, <PER>Harry</PER> cleared <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread <PER>Harry</PER>'s finished letter.
<PER>Harry</PER> Yes, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, that looked all right.
There was no point putting in the dream; <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want it to look as though <PER>Harry</PER> was too worried.
<PER>Harry</PER> folded up the parchment and laid the parchment aside on <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk, ready for when Hedwig returned.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, stretched, and opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s wardrobe once more.
When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto <PER>Dudley</PER>’s plate with a tremulous “There you are, Diddy darling,” <PER>Dudley</PER> glowered at her.
The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all <PER>Dudley</PER>’s favorite things — fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers — and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called “rabbit food.” To make <PER>Dudley</PER> feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that it was a lot smaller than <PER>Dudley</PER>’s.
Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to keep up <PER>Dudley</PER>’s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than <PER>Harry</PER>.
The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, <PER>Harry</PER> had sent Hedwig to <PER>Harry</PER>'s friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to the occasion magnificently.
(<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t touched these; <PER>Harry</PER> had had too much experience of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cooking.)
And then on <PER>Harry</PER>’s birthday (which the Dursleys had completely ignored) <PER>Harry</PER> had received four superb birthday cakes, one each from <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and Sirius.
<PER>Harry</PER> still had two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when <PER>Harry</PER> got back upstairs, <PER>Harry</PER> ate <PER>Harry</PER>'s grapefruit without complaint.
Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at <PER>Dudley</PER>, who had already finished him's own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing <PER>Harry</PER>’s with a very sour look in him's piggy little eyes.
“So,” he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face <PER>Harry</PER> as though he were about to pronounce <PER>Harry</PER> under arrest.
“So.” <PER>Harry</PER> would have dearly loved to have said, “So what?” but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel that Uncle Vernon’s temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food.
Uncle Vernon glared at <PER>Harry</PER>, then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud: Dear Mister and Petunia, We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great deal from <PER>Harry</PER> about my son <PER>Ron</PER>.
We would of course be glad to have <PER>Harry</PER> stay for the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see <PER>Harry</PER> safely onto the train back to school.
It would be best for <PER>Harry</PER> to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and I am not sure <PER>Harry</PER> even knows where it is.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was going on behind the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon’s most fundamental instincts came into conflict.
Allowing <PER>Harry</PER> to go would make <PER>Harry</PER> happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled against for thirteen years.
On the other hand, allowing <PER>Harry</PER> to disappear to the Weasleys’ for the rest of the summer would get rid of <PER>Harry</PER> two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having <PER>Harry</PER> in the house.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone “dumpy,” when his own son, <PER>Dudley</PER>, had finally achieved what his’d been threatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than his’d was tall.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw, with some satisfaction, that <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle looked vaguely panicky.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips form the words “send us your answer in the normal way.” He scowled.
“Normal for us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and before <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle could stop <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> added, “you know, owl post.
“How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face now a rich plum color.
“You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back — ” “Only after <PER>Dudley</PER> finished with them,” said <PER>Harry</PER> coldly, and indeed, <PER>Harry</PER> was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, and which fell past the knees of <PER>Harry</PER>'s extremely baggy jeans.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t following <PER>Dudley</PER>’s diet, and <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t going to let Uncle Vernon stop <PER>Harry</PER> from going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if <PER>Harry</PER> could help it.
“You’re — you’re writing to him, are you?” said Uncle Vernon, in a would-be calm voice — but <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the pupils of <PER>Harry</PER>'s tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.
If he tried to stop <PER>Harry</PER> writing to Sirius, Sirius would think <PER>Harry</PER> was being mistreated.
If <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> he told <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t go to the Quidditch World Cup, <PER>Harry</PER> would write and tell Sirius, who would know <PER>Harry</PER> was being mistreated.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see the conclusion forming in <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle’s mind as though the great mustached face were transparent.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried not to smile, to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s own face as blank as possible.
Outside in the hall He nearly ran into <PER>Dudley</PER>, who had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear <PER>Harry</PER> being told off.
“I feel really full, don’t you?” Laughing at the astonished look on <PER>Dudley</PER>’s face, <PER>Harry</PER> took the stairs three at a time, and hurled <PER>Harry</PER> back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom.
“OUCH!” said <PER>Harry</PER> as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> massaged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit <PER>Harry</PER>, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework.
<PER>Harry</PER> then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent down, recognized <PER>Ron</PER>’s handwriting, then tore open the envelope.
Maybe <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t read <PER>Ron</PER>’s writing.
See you soon — <PER>Ron</PER> “Calm down!” <PER>Harry</PER> said as the small owl flew low over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, twittering madly with what <PER>Harry</PER> could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s eagle-feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh piece of parchment, and wrote: <PER>Ron</PER>, it’s all okay, the Muggles say I can come.
“I’ll be at <PER>Ron</PER>’s when you get back, all right?” <PER>Harry</PER> told her.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched her out of sight, then crawled under <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, wrenched up the loose floorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat there on the floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was flooding through <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had cake, and <PER>Dudley</PER> had nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summer’s day, <PER>Harry</PER> would be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar felt perfectly normal again, and <PER>Harry</PER> was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup.
By twelve o’clock the next day, <PER>Harry</PER>’s school trunk was packed with <PER>Harry</PER>'s school things and all <PER>Harry</PER>'s most prized possessions — the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t bothered about what the neighbors would think, but <PER>Harry</PER> was anxious about how rude the Dursleys might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent most of the afternoon in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom; <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros.
Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but Uncle Vernon's tiny eyes were not moving, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> was really listening with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might for the sound of an approaching car.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t take the tension; <PER>Harry</PER> left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch and <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.
“Maybe — er — the traffic’s bad, or something.” Ten past five then a quarter past five <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to feel anxious Ten past five then a quarter past five <PER>Harry</PER> now.
he and George knew where <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedroom was, having once rescued <PER>Harry</PER>’s from <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedroom in the dead of night.
<PER>Harry</PER> suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of <PER>Dudley</PER>; they had heard a lot about him from <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the clunk of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared <PER>Dudley</PER> out of the kitchen.
“Yep,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “that’s <PER>Dudley</PER>.” He and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming.
Indeed, from the tone of Arthur's voice when Arthur next spoke, <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure that Arthur thought <PER>Dudley</PER> was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought <PER>Harry</PER> was, except that Arthur felt sympathy rather than fear.
“Having a good holiday, <PER>Dudley</PER>?” <PER>Dudley</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands tighten still harder over <PER>Harry</PER>'s massive backside.
“Right then, George,” said Arthur, “you and the trunk.” <PER>Harry</PER> helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn the trunk onto the trunk end so that <PER>Harry</PER> could hold it better.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved toward the fire, but just as <PER>Harry</PER> reached the edge of the hearth, Arthur put out a hand and held Arthur back.
“<PER>Harry</PER> said good-bye to you,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
<PER>Dudley</PER> was no longer standing behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents.
One bewildered second later, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that the foot-long thing was <PER>Dudley</PER>’s tongue — and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before <PER>Harry</PER>.
Aunt Petunia hurled Aunt Petunia onto the ground beside <PER>Dudley</PER>, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, <PER>Dudley</PER> yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight Aunt Petunia's off.
“Not to worry, I can sort him out!” him yelled, advancing on <PER>Dudley</PER> with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw Aunt Petunia on top of <PER>Dudley</PER>, shielding him from Mister Weasley.
“It’s a simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it’s only an Engorgement Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct it — ” But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic-stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging <PER>Dudley</PER>’s tongue as though determined to rip it out; <PER>Dudley</PER> appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mister Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.
“I’ll sort this out!” <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon’s second ornament narrowly missed <PER>Harry</PER>'s left ear, and on balance <PER>Harry</PER> thought it best to leave the situation to Arthur.
Arthur stepped into the fire, looking over Arthur's shoulder as Arthur said “the Burrow!” Arthur last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Arthur blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon’s hand with Arthur's wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of <PER>Dudley</PER>, and <PER>Dudley</PER>’s tongue lolling around like a great slimy python.
<PER>Harry</PER> spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past <PER>Harry</PER>, until <PER>Harry</PER> started to feel sick and closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
Then, when at last <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> slowing down, <PER>Harry</PER> threw out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and came to a halt in time to prevent <PER>Harry</PER> from falling face forward out of the Weasleys’ kitchen fire.
“Did <PER>Harry</PER> eat it?” said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“How’re you doing, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said the nearer of the two, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> and holding out a large hand, which <PER>Harry</PER> shook, feeling calluses and blisters under <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; <PER>Harry</PER> had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around.
“Isn’t he, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yeah, he is, Arthur,” said <PER>Harry</PER> earnestly.
“Oh hello, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear,” she said, spotting <PER>Harry</PER> and smiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that, however angry <PER>Harry</PER> was with Fred and George, <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t really intended to tell Molly what had happened.
One, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s friend, <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
The other, who was small and red-haired, was <PER>Ron</PER>’s younger sister, <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Both of them smiled at <PER>Harry</PER>, who grinned back, which made <PER>Ginny</PER> go scarlet — she had been very taken with <PER>Harry</PER> ever since <PER>Harry</PER>'s first visit to the Burrow.
“If it’s got anything to do with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes — ” “Why don’t you show <PER>Harry</PER> where he’s sleeping, <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> from the doorway.
“He knows where He’s sleeping,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “in my room, He slept there last — ” “We can all go,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> pointedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> edged out of the kitchen, and they, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> both laughed, although <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t.
“You might sneer, <PER>Ron</PER>,” Percy said heatedly, “but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow- bottomed products that seriously endanger — ” “Yeah, yeah, all right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and he started off upstairs again.
As <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> followed <PER>Ron</PER> up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them.
The room at the top of the house where <PER>Ron</PER> slept looked much as it had the last time that <PER>Harry</PER> had come to stay: the same posters of <PER>Ron</PER>’s favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered <PER>Ron</PER>’s letter to <PER>Harry</PER> in Privet Drive.
“Percy gets to keep Percy's room all to Percy because Percy’s got to work.” “Er — why are you calling that owl Pig?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> named him,” he explained to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> too well to take him seriously.
<PER>Harry</PER> had moaned continually about <PER>Harry</PER>'s old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when <PER>Hermione</PER>’s cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Where’s Crookshanks?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> now.
“They saved my life, those cakes.” “And have you heard from — ?” <PER>Ron</PER> began, but at a look from <PER>Hermione</PER> he fell silent.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> had been about to ask about Sirius.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about <PER>Harry</PER>’s godfather as <PER>Harry</PER> was.
Nobody but themselves and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s innocence.
“I think they’ve stopped arguing,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, to cover the awkward moment, because <PER>Ginny</PER> was looking curiously from <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan.
“C’mon,” <PER>Ron</PER> said hurriedly to <PER>Harry</PER>, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, “let’s go and help Bill and Charlie.” They left Molly and headed out the back door into the yard.
Fred and George were cheering, <PER>Ginny</PER> was laughing, and <PER>Hermione</PER> was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.
By seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Molly’s excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were settling <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> down to eat beneath a clear, deep- blue sky.
To somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, <PER>Harry</PER> listened rather than talked as <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.
“The top- secret one.” <PER>Ron</PER> rolled his eyes and muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, “He’s been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since He started work.
Flying came more naturally to <PER>Harry</PER> than anything else in the magical world, and <PER>Harry</PER> played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.
<PER>Harry</PER> was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as <PER>Harry</PER> watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then <PER>Harry</PER> said very quietly to <PER>Harry</PER>, “So — have you heard from Sirius lately?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked around, listening closely.
“We sent it.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> had barely lain down to sleep in <PER>Ron</PER>’s room when <PER>Harry</PER> was being shaken awake by Molly.
“Time to go, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear,” she whispered, moving away to wake <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt around for <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses, put them on, and sat up.
At the foot of <PER>Harry</PER>’s mattress <PER>Harry</PER> saw two large, disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets.
“We’re supposed to go incognito — do I look like a Muggle, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, smiling, “very good.” “Where ’re Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?” said George, failing to stifle a huge yawn.
“Percy’s been Apparating downstairs every morning since, just to prove Percy can.” There were footsteps down the passageway and <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> came into the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy.
“Why do we have to be up so early?” <PER>Ginny</PER> said, rubbing early?” <PER>Ginny</PER>'s eyes and sitting down at the table.
“I’ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along around midday,Molly said to Arthur, as he, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> set off across the dark yard after Fred and George.
Each breath <PER>Harry</PER> took was sharp in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest and Each breath <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs were starting to seize up when, at last, Each breath <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet found level ground.
“This is <PER>Hermione</PER>, friend of <PER>Ron</PER>’s — and <PER>Harry</PER>, another friend — ” “Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening.
<PER>Harry</PER> was used to people looking curiously at <PER>Harry</PER> when they met <PER>Harry</PER>, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made <PER>Harry</PER> feel uncomfortable.
“<PER>Harry</PER> fell off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom, Dad,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
“Three ” muttered Arthur, one eye still on his watch, “two one ” It happened immediately: <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though a hook just behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> feet left the ground; <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>, their shoulders banging into his; their were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then — him feet slammed into the ground; <PER>Ron</PER> staggered into him and him fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near him's head with a heavy thud.
<PER>Harry</PER> disentangled himself from <PER>Ron</PER> and got to his feet.
When <PER>Harry</PER> heard their footsteps, <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to look at their.
Arthur retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned <PER>Harry</PER> toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized the symptoms of one who had just had <PER>Harry</PER>'s memory modified.
<PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have spotted this problem too; <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a quizzical look as Arthur dropped to Arthur's hands and knees and entered the first tent.
“It’s on the other side of the field.” “Well, why don’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> go and get us some water then” — Arthur handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans — “and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire?” “But we’ve got an oven,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> he muttered distractedly, “In broad daylight!
<PER>Harry</PER> caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t understand a word, the tone of every single voice was excited.
When they had assured her that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off again, though, as <PER>Ron</PER> said, “Like we’d say anything else surrounded by that lot.” “I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over the Bulgarians's tents?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument.
“I like a healthy breeze ’round my privates, thanks.” <PER>Hermione</PER> was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that <PER>Hermione</PER> had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away.
Oliver Wood, the old captain of <PER>Harry</PER>’s House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged <PER>Harry</PER> over to <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ tent to introduce <PER>Harry</PER>, and told <PER>Harry</PER> excitedly that <PER>Harry</PER> had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team.
More to stop <PER>Ron</PER> from smirking than anything, <PER>Harry</PER> hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen before.
Mister Weasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s benefit; Mister Weasley's own children knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly interested.
his nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray Bludger, <PER>Harry</PER> thought), but <PER>Harry</PER>'s round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy complexion made <PER>Harry</PER> look like a very overgrown schoolboy.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see at once why Percy idolized <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> as they and <PER>Hermione</PER> strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs.
“You won’t be getting anything for Christmas,” <PER>Harry</PER> told him, thrusting Omnioculars into him's and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hands.
“Oooh, thanks, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.
Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris, Hogsmeade <PER>Harry</PER> tore Hogsmeade <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes away from the sign and looked over Hogsmeade <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them.
<PER>Harry</PER> had set Dobby free from <PER>Harry</PER>'s old owners, the <PER>Malfoy</PER> family.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> spun around in their seats to look.
Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from <PER>Harry</PER>, they had never actually met <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You is surely <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” “Yeah, I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium.
Highly embarrassed, Percy repaired them with Percy's wand and thereafter remained in Percy's seat, throwing jealous looks at <PER>Harry</PER>, whom <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge had greeted like an old friend.
They had met before, and Fudge shook <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how <PER>Harry</PER> was, and introduced <PER>Harry</PER> to the wizards on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter oh come on now, you know who he is the boy who survived <PER>Voldemort</PER> you do know who he is — ” The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.
Edging along the second row to three still-empty seats right behind Arthur were none other than Dobby the house-elf’s former owners: Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>; his son, <PER>Malfoy</PER>; and a woman <PER>Harry</PER> supposed must be <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s mother.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been enemies ever since <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s very first journey to Hogwarts.
A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, <PER>Malfoy</PER> greatly resembled <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s father.
“Ah, Fudge,” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, holding out Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hand as Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> reached the Minister of Magic.
Arthur and Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked at each other and <PER>Harry</PER> vividly recalled the last time Arthur and Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> had come face-to-face: It had been in Flourish and Blotts’ bookshop, and they had had a fight.
Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s eyes had returned to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew exactly what was making Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s lip curl like that.
The <PER>Malfoy</PER>s prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, themselves considered anyone of Muggle descent, like <PER>Hermione</PER>, second-class.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> shot <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> one contemptuous look, then settled himself between himself's mother and father.
“Slimy gits,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered as he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned to face the field again.
“Veelal” “What are veel — ?” But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s question was answered for <PER>Harry</PER>.
This puzzled <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment while <PER>Harry</PER> tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon- bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind but then the music started, and <PER>Harry</PER> stopped worrying about them not being human — in fact, <PER>Harry</PER> stopped worrying about anything at all.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what are you doing?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice from a long way off.
<PER>Harry</PER> was standing up, and one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs was resting on the wall of the box.
Next to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> was frozen in an attitude that looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> were about to dive from a springboard.
<PER>Harry</PER> was with them; <PER>Harry</PER> would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered vaguely why <PER>Harry</PER> had a large green shamrock pinned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Hermione</PER> reached up and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
“There you go,” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, “for the Omnioculars!
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly focused <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
<PER>Harry</PER> spun the speed dial on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted Mostafa's broomstick and kicked a large wooden crate open — four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (<PER>Harry</PER> saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch.
<PER>Harry</PER> spun the slow dial on the right of <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and <PER>Harry</PER> was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against <PER>Harry</PER>'s eardrums.
Hawkshead Attacking Formation, <PER>Harry</PER> read as <PER>Harry</PER> watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians.
“Ten zero to Ireland!” “What?” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, looking wildly around through <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars.
“But Levski’s got the Quaffle!” “<PER>Harry</PER>, if you’re not going to watch at normal speed, you’re going to miss things!” shouted <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked quickly over the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omni-oculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock.
<PER>Harry</PER> screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes too; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind on the game.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed their descent through <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was “They’re going to crash!” screamed <PER>Hermione</PER> next to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> was using a broomstick at all; <PER>Harry</PER> moved so easily through the air that <PER>Harry</PER> looked unsupported and weightless.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum.
<PER>Harry</PER>, focusing still more closely upon Krum’s face, saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below.
Whatever happened was over so quickly <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa’s long, shrill whistle blast, told <PER>Harry</PER> it had been a foul.
As one, the Weasley boys and <PER>Harry</PER> stuffed their fingers into their ears, but <PER>Hermione</PER>, who hadn’t bothered, was soon tugging on <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to look at her, and her pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers impatiently out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned this way and that, staring through <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars, as the Quaffle changed hands with the speed of a bullet.
How He could see where He was going, <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> was drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again — “They’re going to crash!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Squinting toward the entrance, <PER>Harry</PER> saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that <PER>Harry</PER>’d been using sign language all day for nothing.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Harry</PER> seemed much less coordinated on the ground.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> went into the next tent, and <PER>Harry</PER> and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks.
“I wouldn’t fancy having to go and tell the Irish the Irish’ve got to stop celebrating.” <PER>Harry</PER>, who was on a top bunk above <PER>Ron</PER>, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of Krum’s more spectacular moves.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> in robes that had <PER>Harry</PER>'s name on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman’s voice echoed throughout the stadium, “I give you PotteA.” <PER>Harry</PER> never knew whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> had actually dropped off to sleep — <PER>Harry</PER>'s fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams — all he knew was that, quite suddenly, Arthur was shouting.
He slipped down from the bunk and reached for He's clothes, but Arthur, who had pulled on He's jeans over He's own pajamas, said, “No time, <PER>Harry</PER> — just grab a jacket and get outside — quickly!” <PER>Harry</PER> did as <PER>Harry</PER> — was told and hurried out of the tent, <PER>Ron</PER> at his heels.
Once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s way with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“C’mon,” said Fred, grabbing <PER>Ginny</PER>’s hand and starting to pull <PER>Ginny</PER>’s's toward the wood.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and George followed.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> yell with pain.
“What happened?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously, stopping so abruptly that <PER>Harry</PER> walked into <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned sharply.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> arms folded, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees.
<PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Malfoy</PER> to do something that <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> would never have dared say in front of Molly “Language, Weasley,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, his pale eyes glittering.
“Never mind, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, seizing <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Out there wearing masks, are they?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> turned his face to <PER>Harry</PER>, still smiling.
“Well if they were, I wouldn’t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?” “Oh come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with a disgusted look at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, “let’s go and find the others.” “Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,” sneered <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Come on,” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated, and she pulled <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> up the path again.
When they saw <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, “ Ou est Madame Maxime?
“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling out his wand, lighting it like <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, and squinting up the path.
<PER>Harry</PER> dug in the pockets of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket for <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand — but it wasn’t there.
“Ah, no, I don’t believe it I’ve lost my wand!” “You’re kidding!” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground; <PER>Harry</PER> looked all around <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand was nowhere to be seen.
<PER>Harry</PER> was thinking of Dobby: Every time <PER>Harry</PER> had tried to do something the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s wouldn’t like, the house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up.
“Let’s just keep moving, shall we?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw him glance edgily at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Perhaps there was truth in what <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said; perhaps <PER>Hermione</PER> was in more danger than they were.
They set off again, <PER>Harry</PER> still searching <PER>Harry</PER>'s pockets, even though <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand wasn’t there.
He turned to tell <PER>Ron</PER> this, but <PER>Ron</PER>’s face had gone oddly slack, and next second <PER>Ron</PER> was yelling, “Did I tell you I’ve invented a broomstick that’ll reach Jupiter?” “Honestly\” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Ron</PER> firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away.
<PER>Harry</PER> no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in <PER>Harry</PER>'s step.
“Imagine if your dad catches Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting down next to <PER>Ron</PER> and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves.
“He’s always said He’d like to get something on He.” “That’d wipe the smirk off old <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face, all right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked quickly around too.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and peered around the tree.
It was too dark to see very far, but <PER>Harry</PER> could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision.
<PER>Harry</PER> scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see anyone.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come on, move\” <PER>Hermione</PER> had seized the collar of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket and was tugging him backward.
“It’s the Dark Mark, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned, pulling him as hard as <PER>Hermione</PER> could.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s sign!” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s — ?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, come on!” <PER>Harry</PER> turned — <PER>Ron</PER> was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum — the three of them started across the clearing — but before them had taken a few hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.
<PER>Harry</PER> whirled around, and in an instant, <PER>Harry</PER> registered one fact: Each of these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“STUPEFYl” roared twenty voices — there was a blinding series of flashes and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the hair on <PER>Harry</PER>'s head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing.
Raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s head a fraction of an inch <PER>Harry</PER> saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards’ wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness — “Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER>” — his voice sounded shaky — “<PER>Hermione</PER> — are you all right?” “Out of the way, Arthur,” said a cold, curt voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet to face them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> watched him vanish with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth.
<PER>Harry</PER> was reminded forcibly of Dobby in <PER>Harry</PER>'s moments of terrified disobedience.
“Sorry carried away ” “I didn’t drop it there, anyway,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, jerking <PER>Harry</PER>'s thumb toward the trees beneath the skull.
“Winky’s got a squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper!” She looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, appealing for their support.
“It didn’t sound anything like Winky, did It?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> gasp, horrified, as a gigantic serpent-tongued skull erupted from the point where the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them; it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke: the ghost of a spell.
But <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t seem to want to move; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes were still upon the sobbing elf.
She turned and followed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> out of the clearing and off through the trees.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered after him.
With some assistance from <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, Arthur explained what had happened in the woods.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> just picked it up off the ground!” “Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently.
“Of course people panicked it was almost like seeing <PER>Voldemort</PER> back again.” “I don’t get it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, frowning.
“Dad, we met <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the woods, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> as good as told we <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s dad was one of those nutters in masks!
“If they really were Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when <PER>Voldemort</PER> lost power, and told all sorts of lies about <PER>Voldemort</PER> forcing them to kill and torture people.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to <PER>Harry</PER> now to ease <PER>Harry</PER> to sleep, and it was a long time after Charlie’s snores filled the tent that <PER>Harry</PER> finally dozed off.
“No no, there hasn’t been any post at all.” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked curiously at <PER>Harry</PER>.
With a meaningful look at both of them he said, “All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, <PER>Ron</PER>?” “Yeah think I will too,” said <PER>Ron</PER> at once.
“What’s up, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind they.
“On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s reactions were almost exactly as <PER>Harry</PER> had imagined them back in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom on Privet Drive.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse.
“And remember what Professor Trelawney said?” <PER>Harry</PER> went on, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s terrified look vanished as <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a derisive snort.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, you aren’t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?” “You weren’t there,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked.
“Hedwig’s not going to manage that journey in a few days.” “Yeah, I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but there was a leaden feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach as <PER>Harry</PER> looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.
“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“If Dad hadn’t said anything, old <PER>Rita</PER> would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented,” said Bill, who was playing chess with <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was immersed in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Molly had bought for <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> in Diagon Alley.
<PER>Harry</PER> was polishing <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> for <PER>Harry</PER>'s thirteenth birthday open at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“A high- ranking Ministry official like Mister Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants — ” “His slave, you mean!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice rising passionately, “because His didn’t pay Winky, did His?” “I think you’d all better go upstairs and check that you’ve packed properly!” said Molly, breaking up the argument.
“Bung him some Owl Treats,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, throwing a packet across to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It might shut <PER>Harry</PER> up.” <PER>Harry</PER> poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon’s cage, then turned to his trunk.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, you don’t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?” “Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, <PER>Harry</PER> had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for <PER>Harry</PER>'s potion- making kit — <PER>Harry</PER> had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna.
— <PER>Harry</PER> was just piling underwear into — <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron when <PER>Ron</PER> made a loud noise of disgust behind — <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Now, mind you pack them properly so them don’t crease.” “Mum, you’ve given me <PER>Ginny</PER>’s new dress,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, handing it out to <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Well, they’re okay!” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily, looking at <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> would willingly have split all the money in <PER>Harry</PER>'s Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew they would never take it.
When <PER>Harry</PER> and the others entered the kitchen, <PER>Harry</PER> and the others saw Molly rummaging anxiously in the drawers — “I’ve got a quill here somewhere!” — and Arthur bending over the fire, talking to — <PER>Harry</PER> shut <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that them were working properly.
“I’d better hurry — you have a good term, boys,” said Arthur to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to Disapparate.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s not what you’d call normal, though, is <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said Fred.
Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were all severely scratched.
They did it in groups today; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> (the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front of them.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train.
“Thanks for having us to stay, Molly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“It’s going to be very exciting — mind you, I’m very glad they’ve changed the rules — ” “What rules?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George together.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went back to their compartment.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door. "
” <PER>Hermione</PER> got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid the compartment door shut, blocking out <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice.
After half an hour or so, <PER>Hermione</PER>, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried <PER>Hermione</PER> once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm.
“Oh wow,” said <PER>Neville</PER> enviously as <PER>Ron</PER> tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.
“We were in the Top Box — ” “For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had appeared in the doorway.
“Don’t remember asking you to join us, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> coolly.
A sleeve of <PER>Ron</PER>’s dress robes was dangling from A sleeve of <PER>Ron</PER>’s dress robes, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.
<PER>Ron</PER> made to stuff the robes out of sight, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> was too quick for him; <PER>Malfoy</PER> seized A sleeve of <PER>Ron</PER>’s dress robes and pulled.
“Look at this!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> in ecstasy, holding up <PER>Ron</PER>’s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley, you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you?
“<PER>Ron</PER>l” said <PER>Hermione</PER> reproachfully, and <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, muttered “ ReparoV ’ and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door.
“Don’t let <PER>Malfoy</PER> get to you, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “Him!
<PER>Hermione</PER> bundled up Crookshanks in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cloak and <PER>Ron</PER> left his dress robes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour.
“Hi, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform.
“All righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> bellowed back, waving.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> climbed gratefully into one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward Hogwarts Castle.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase.
Drenched and sputtering, <PER>Ron</PER> staggered sideways into <PER>Harry</PER>, just as a second water bomb dropped — narrowly missing <PER>Hermione</PER>, it burst at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet, sending a wave of cold water over <PER>Harry</PER>'s sneakers into <PER>Harry</PER>'s socks.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as <PER>Harry</PER> took aim again.
“Peeves, come down here at ONCE!” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> around the neck to stop <PER>Hermione</PER> from falling.
“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger — ” “That’s all right, Professor!” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, massaging <PER>Hermione</PER>'s throat.
“Into the Great Hall, come on!” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right, <PER>Ron</PER> muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost.
“Says who?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, taking off <PER>Harry</PER>'s sneakers and emptying them of water.
“Hiya, <PER>Harry</PER>!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom <PER>Harry</PER> was something of a hero.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
he turned back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Nearly Headless Nick.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, of course, was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t think who else was missing.
On Professor Sinistra ’s other side was the sallow-faced, hook- nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, <PER>Snape</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER>’s least favorite person at Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s loathing of <PER>Snape</PER> was matched only by <PER>Snape</PER> ’s hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when <PER>Harry</PER> had helped Sirius escape right under <PER>Snape</PER> ’s overlarge nose — <PER>Snape</PER> and Sirius had been enemies since their own school days.
On <PER>Snape</PER> ’s other side was an empty seat, which <PER>Harry</PER> guessed was Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s.
The tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s long, thin fingers were together and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s was resting <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s's chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s's half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought.
“Oh hurry up,” <PER>Ron</PER> moaned, beside <PER>Harry</PER>, “I could eat a hippogriff.” The words were no sooner out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell.
If <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked.
All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as them filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school — all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s moleskin overcoat.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught a glimpse of <PER>Cho</PER>, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as <PER>Harry</PER> sat down.
“Baddock, Malcolm!” The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Malfoy</PER> clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins.
“Branstone, Eleanor!” “Cauldwell, Owen!” “Creevey, Dennis!” Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s moleskin, just as <PER>Hagrid</PER> himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table.
About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming — a misleading impression, for <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> knew <PER>Hagrid</PER> to possess a very kind nature.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had gotten to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet.
“ Tuck in.” “Hear, hear!” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> loudly as the empty dishes filled magically before <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> loudly's eyes.
Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> loaded their own plates.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had knocked over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s golden goblet.
“House-elves don’t want sick leave and pensions!” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked down at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hardly touched plate of food, then put <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh c’mon, ’Er-my-knee,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, accidentally spraying <PER>Harry</PER> with bits of Yorkshire pudding.
“You won’t get them sick leave by starving yourself!” “Slave labor,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, breathing hard through <PER>Hermione</PER>'s nose.
“Treacle tart, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, deliberately wafting its smell toward her.
When the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving the puddings sparkling clean, Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet again.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook it, muttering words <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t hear.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger, who shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s right-hand side.
The stranger sat down, shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mane of dark gray hair out of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face, pulled a plate of sausages toward his, raised a plate of sausages toward his to what was left of his nose, and sniffed it.
“Professor Moody.” It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of the staff or students clapped except <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who both put their hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly quickly.
“Moody?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> cleared <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as the Hogwarts champion.
At every House table, <PER>Harry</PER> could see people either gazing raptly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, or else whispering fervently to people's neighbors.
“Yeah, a thousand Galleons ” “Come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “we’ll be the only ones left here if you don’t move.” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways in which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.
<PER>Hermione</PER> cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look, and <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly heard <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mutter “ Slave labor,” before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls’ dormitory.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> climbed up the last, spiral staircase until <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> reached <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>'s own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> got into their pajamas and into bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> grinned into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillow, exceptionally glad that <PER>Ron</PER> couldn’t see what <PER>Harry</PER> could.
The storm had blown The storm out by the following morning, though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> examined their new course schedules at breakfast.
Professor Trelawney kept predicting <PER>Harry</PER>’s death, which <PER>Harry</PER> found extremely annoying.
“You should have given it up like me, shouldn’t you?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly, buttering <PER>Hermione</PER> some toast.
“Then you’d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy.” “You’re eating again, I notice,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, watching <PER>Hermione</PER> adding liberal amounts of jam to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s toast too.
A large tawny owl soared down to <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom and deposited a parcel into <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom's lap — <PER>Neville</PER> almost always forgot to pack something.
On the other side of the Hall <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home.
Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, <PER>Harry</PER> returned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s porridge.
“Mornin’!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The speaker was <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“What is the point of they?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a few seconds’ pause, then he said roughly, “Tha’s next lesson, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Nothing but deep affection for <PER>Hagrid</PER> could have made <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts.
“Eurgh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, what’s that pointy thing on it?” “Ah, some of ’em have got stings,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> enthusiastically (Lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box).
“Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a dragon for a pet, would you?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grinned at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> knew only too well — he had owned one for a brief period during their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of Norbert.
“They are now,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in an exasperated voice, “but once <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s found out what they eat, I expect they’ll be six feet long.” “Well, that won’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something, will it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning slyly at her.
“You know perfectly well I only said that to shut <PER>Malfoy</PER> up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> began to eat so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at her.
“You’re going to make yourself puke instead?” “No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with as much dignity as <PER>Hermione</PER> could muster with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth bulging with sprouts.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> leapt to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, said, “See you at dinner!” and departed at high speed.
When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> set off for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where Professor Trelawney lived.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat down at the same small circular table.
A very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at <PER>Harry</PER> with the tragic expression Professor Trelawney always wore whenever Professor Trelawney saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> rolled his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>, who looked stonily back.
“ ‘I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ’ ” But <PER>Hermione</PER> was right, <PER>Harry</PER> thought irritably, Professor Trelawney really was an old fraud.
Except, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made the prediction about <PER>Voldemort</PER> rising again and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine, when <PER>Harry</PER> had described it to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>\” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered.
“What?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around; the whole class was staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat up straight; <PER>Harry</PER> had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts.
“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said <PER>Harry</PER> after a while, frowning down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s piece of parchment, “that can’t be right, can it?” “Aaaaah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, imitating Professor Trelawney’s mystical whisper, “when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, <PER>Harry</PER> ” Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown — “Oh Professor, look!
“Get stuffed, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?” “You know your mother, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> — both he and <PER>Hermione</PER> had grabbed the back of <PER>Ron</PER>’s robes to stop him from launching himself at <PER>Malfoy</PER> — “that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under shis nose?
Several people screamed — <PER>Harry</PER> felt something white-hot graze the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face — <PER>Harry</PER> plunged <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand into <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes for his wand, but before his’d even touched it, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a second loud BANG, and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall.
Moody turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER> — at least, <PER>Harry</PER>'s normal eye was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>; the other one was pointing into the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was coming down the marble staircase with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s arms full of books.
“No!” cried Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> got to <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s feet, wincing.
“Surely Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told you that?” “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might’ve mentioned it, yeah,” said Moody, scratching Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s chin unconcernedly, “but I thought a good sharp shock — ” “We give detentions, Moody!
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wand at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms.
“Don’t talk to me,” <PER>Ron</PER> said quietly to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, the amazing bouncing ferret ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both laughed, and <PER>Hermione</PER> began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.
“It was good, really, that Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stopped it — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> furiously, his eyes snapping open again, “you’re ruining the best moment of my life!” <PER>Hermione</PER> made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again.
“We had him this afternoon,” him told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave <PER>Neville</PER> detention, and <PER>Neville</PER> returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.
“You know why <PER>Snape</PER> ’s in such a foul mood, don’t you?” said <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> as they watched <PER>Hermione</PER> teaching <PER>Neville</PER> a Scouring Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails.
“Moody.” It was common knowledge that <PER>Snape</PER> really wanted the Dark Arts job, and <PER>Snape</PER> had now failed to get it for the fourth year running.
<PER>Snape</PER> had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it — but <PER>Snape</PER> seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody.
Indeed, whenever <PER>Harry</PER> saw the two of them together — at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors — <PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct impression that <PER>Snape</PER> was avoiding Moody’s eye, whether magical or normal.
“I reckon <PER>Snape</PER>’s a bit scared of <PER>Snape</PER>’s, you know,” <PER>Harry</PER> said thoughtfully.
“Imagine if Moody turned <PER>Snape</PER> into a horned toad,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his eyes misting over, “and bounced him all around him's dungeon.
Moody’s magical eye spun around to stare at <PER>Ron</PER>; <PER>Ron</PER> looked extremely apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled — the first time <PER>Harry</PER> had seen him do so.
“So do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law?” Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ron</PER> recoil slightly next to <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Ron</PER> hated spiders.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was talking about the days in which <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been all-powerful.
her was looking, not at the spider, but at <PER>Neville</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>, following her gaze, saw that <PER>Neville</PER>’s hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, him's knuckles white, him's eyes wide and horrified.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been picturing <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since <PER>Harry</PER>’d found out they had been murdered, ever since <PER>Harry</PER>’d found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’ whereabouts to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, who had come to find them at them's cottage.
How <PER>Voldemort</PER> had killed <PER>Harry</PER>’s father first.
How James Potter had tried to hold James Potter off, while James Potter shouted at James Potter's wife to take <PER>Harry</PER> and run <PER>Voldemort</PER> had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill <PER>Harry</PER> how her had begged <PER>Harry</PER> to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son and so <PER>Voldemort</PER> had murdered her too, before turning his wand on <PER>Harry</PER> .
<PER>Harry</PER> knew these details because <PER>Harry</PER> had heard <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ voices when <PER>Harry</PER> had fought the dementors last year — for that was the terrible power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair .
With a massive effort, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> back to the present and listened to what Moody was saying.
Most people were discussing the curses in awed voices — “Did you see it twitch?” “ — and when he killed it — just like that!” They were talking about the lesson, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as though it had been some sort of spectacular show, but <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t found it very entertaining — and nor, it seemed, had <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Hurry up,” she said tensely to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Neville</PER>.” <PER>Neville</PER> was standing alone, halfway up a side passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look him had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.
“<PER>Neville</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> said gently.
“Oh hello,” <PER>Neville</PER> said, <PER>Neville</PER>'s voice much higher than usual.
“Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what’s for eating?” <PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a startled look.
“What was that about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, watching <PER>Neville</PER> and Moody turn the corner.
“Some lesson, though, eh?” said <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> as they set off for the Great Hall.
<PER>Hermione</PER> did not join in with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s conversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and <PER>Harry</PER>, who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.
“Wouldn’t Moody and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we’d seen the curses?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked as they approached the Fat Lady.
“But <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s always done things <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s way, hasn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and Moody’s been getting in trouble for years, I reckon.
“You all right, <PER>Neville</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> thought I’d like this.” Telling <PER>Neville</PER> what Professor Sprout had said, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering <PER>Neville</PER> up, for <PER>Neville</PER> very rarely heard that <PER>Harry</PER> was good at anything.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month.
“You know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, “I think it’s back to the old Divination standby.” “What — make it up?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write.
“You know her — just put in loads of misery, shell lap it up.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, crumpling up <PER>Harry</PER>'s first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire.
Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared inscrutably at <PER>Harry</PER>, rather as <PER>Hermione</PER> might look if <PER>Hermione</PER> knew they weren’t doing <PER>Hermione</PER> knew they were's homework properly.
<PER>Harry</PER> grinned and quickly returned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s predictions — <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want George to think <PER>Harry</PER> was eavesdropping.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sat down, laid the things <PER>Hermione</PER> was carrying in an empty armchair, and pulled <PER>Ron</PER>’s predictions toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> laid down <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill too, having just finished predicting <PER>Harry</PER>'s own death by decapitation.
“Funny you should ask,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with a nasty look at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, of course you haven’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly, “I’ve only just started it.” “Yeah?” said <PER>Ron</PER> in mild surprise.
<PER>Harry</PER> hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s knee, hooting softly.
<PER>Harry</PER> read it aloud: <PER>Harry</PER> — I’m flying north immediately.
My best to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Sirius <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who stared back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“HeHe’s coming back?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s reading what signs?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking perplexed.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — what’s up?” For <PER>Harry</PER> had just hit <PER>Harry</PER> in the forehead with <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist, jolting Hedwig out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s lap.
“I shouldn’t’ve told <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> said furiously.
“It’s made him think him’s got to come back!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, now slamming <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of <PER>Ron</PER>’s chair, hooting indignantly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> began, in a pacifying sort of voice.
“See you in the morning.” Upstairs in the dormitory <PER>Harry</PER> pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas and got into <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel remotely tired.
If Sirius came back and got caught, it would be <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s, fault.
For a long time, <PER>Harry</PER> lay staring up at the dark canopy of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
The dormitory was completely silent, and, had <PER>Harry</PER> been less preoccupied, <PER>Harry</PER> would have realized that the absence of <PER>Neville</PER>’s usual snores meant that <PER>Harry</PER> was not the only one lying awake.
Early next morning, <PER>Harry</PER> woke with a plan fully formed in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleeping brain had been working on it all night.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking <PER>Ron</PER>, and went back down to the deserted common room.
Here <PER>Harry</PER> took a piece of parchment from the table upon which <PER>Harry</PER>'s Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter: Dear Sirius, I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to Dear Sirius last time.
It took <PER>Harry</PER> a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, as her kept shuffling around on her perch, showing <PER>Harry</PER> her tail.
In the end, it was <PER>Harry</PER> suggesting her might be too tired, and that perhaps <PER>Harry</PER> would ask <PER>Ron</PER> to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it.
“Just find him, all right?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, stroking her back as <PER>Harry</PER> carried her on <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm to one of the holes in the wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched Shis fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been so sure that Sirius’s reply would alleviate <PER>Harry</PER>'s worries rather than increasing them.
“That was a lie, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply over breakfast, when he told <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER> what he had done.
“He’s not going back to Azkaban because of me.” “Drop it,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sharply to <PER>Hermione</PER> as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, <PER>Hermione</PER> heeded him, and fell silent.
<PER>Harry</PER> did <PER>Harry</PER>'s best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks.
True, <PER>Harry</PER> could not stop <PER>Harry</PER> from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before <PER>Harry</PER> went to sleep, prevent <PER>Harry</PER> from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes <PER>Harry</PER> tried to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind off <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather.
“You said — to use it against another human was — ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants you taught what it feels like,” said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto <PER>Hermione</PER> and fixing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s with an eerie, unblinking stare.
<PER>Hermione</PER> went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that <PER>Hermione</PER> wanted to leave.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grinned at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched as, one by one, <PER>Harry</PER>'s classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence.
<PER>Neville</PER> performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics <PER>Neville</PER> would certainly not have been capable of in <PER>Neville</PER>'s normal state.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice, echoing in some distant chamber of <PER>Harry</PER>'s empty brain: Jump onto the desk jump onto the desk .
<PER>Harry</PER> bent <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees obediently, preparing to spring.
<PER>Harry</PER> had both jumped and tried to prevent <PER>Harry</PER> from jumping — the result was that he’d smashed headlong into the desk, knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.
“Now, that’s more like it!” growled Moody’s voice, and suddenly, <PER>Harry</PER> felt the empty, echoing feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head disappear.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees seemed to double.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that them had received top marks for them's homework in them's next Divination class.
“I will not,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> flatly when <PER>Hagrid</PER> had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra- large toy out of his sack.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> put down <PER>Malfoy</PER> was particularly satisfying, especially because <PER>Malfoy</PER> had done his very best to get <PER>Hagrid</PER> sacked the previous year.
“Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can’t even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which <PER>Neville</PER> had accidentally transplanted <PER>Neville</PER>'s own ears onto a cactus.
Behind the teachers’ table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a large letter H. <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down beside Fred and George at the Gryffindor table.
“Thought any more about trying to enter?” “I asked <PER>McGonagall</PER> how the champions are chosen but <PER>McGonagall</PER> wasn’t telling,” said George bitterly.
“<PER>McGonagall</PER> says the champions get awarded points according to how well they’ve done the tasks.” “Who are the judges?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and everyone looked around at <PER>Hermione</PER>, rather surprised, “because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.” She noticed them all looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and said, with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books <PER>Hermione</PER> had, “It’s all in Hogwarts, A History.
“Not once, in over a thousand pages, does Hogwarts, A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves!” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and applied <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s scrambled eggs.
His and <PER>Ron</PER>’s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s determination to pursue justice for house-elves.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had been badgering <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> ever since, first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses.
Some people, like <PER>Neville</PER>, had paid up just to stop <PER>Hermione</PER> from glowering at them.
“Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “No, of course not,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> curtly, “I hardly think students are supposed to — ” “Well, we have,” said George, indicating Fred, “loads of times, to nick food.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> stopped talking abruptly; <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> watched Hedwig anxiously as <PER>Hermione</PER> fluttered down onto <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, folded <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wings, and held out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s leg wearily.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled off Sirius’s reply and offered Hedwig <PER>Harry</PER>'s bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully.
Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in further discussions about the Tri-wizard Tournament, <PER>Harry</PER> read out Sirius’s letter in a whisper to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
When the bell rang early, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall.
“Weasley, straighten your hat,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> snapped at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, standing between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the fourth row from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage — a shoe the size of a child’s sled — followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, and that was <PER>Hagrid</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> started to clap; the students, following <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, though tall <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, had barely to bend to kiss it.
“But ze ’orses — ” “Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other — er — charges.” “Skrewts,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“How big d’you reckon Durmstrang’s horses are going to be?” Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, if they’re any bigger than this lot, even <PER>Hagrid</PER> won’t be able to handle them,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s a mast!” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
All of them, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, seemed to be built along the lines of Crabbe and Goyle but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that their were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!
“Dear old Hogwarts,” he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Harry</PER>'s smile did not extend to <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, which remained cold and shrewd.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need the punch on the arm <PER>Ron</PER> gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — it’s Krum\” t'fyfflapier- l6 “I don’t believe it!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang.
“You haven’t got a quill, have you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Nope, they’re upstairs in my bag,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug about this.
“Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> scathingly.
<PER>Harry</PER> was surprised to see that <PER>Harry</PER> added four chairs, two on either side of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s.
He slid into his seat at the end and waved at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> with a very heavily bandaged hand.
“Skrewts doing all right, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> called.
“When you’ve both put your eyes back in,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly, “you’ll be able to see who’s just arrived.” <PER>Hermione</PER> was pointing up at the staff table.
Remembering Bartemius Crouch in Bartemius Crouch's neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> looked strange in wizard’s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s long white hair and beard.
Perhaps <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had noticed the listening students's sudden stillness, for <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “The casket, then, if you please, Mister Filch.” Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached <PER>Dumbledore</PER> carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels.
“You’ll try and get in, won’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> thought briefly of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament filled himself's mind again.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered how angry <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the Age Line.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” But this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s students.
“I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting boy — ” Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped to let <PER>Harry</PER> walk through first.
He turned He's head back to <PER>Harry</PER> and stared at <PER>Harry</PER> as though He couldn’t believe He's eyes.
Karkaroff s eyes moved slowly up <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and fixed upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar.
Out of the corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye, <PER>Harry</PER> saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends.
“Done it,” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m not sure this is going to work, you know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> warningly “I’m sure <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will have thought of this.” Fred, George, and Lee ignored her.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> surveyed Fred and George, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes twinkling.
“What’re we going to do today, then?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.
“We haven’t been down to visit <PER>Hagrid</PER> yet,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Okay,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “just as long as he doesn’t ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts.” A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face.
“Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?” “What is it with her?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, exasperated, as <PER>Hermione</PER> ran away up the marble staircase.
“Hey, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly.
“What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who aren’t chosen?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire.
<PER>Harry</PER> knocked on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s door, and Fang’s booming barks answered instantly “ ’Bout time!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, when he’d flung open the door.
“Thought you lot’d forgotten where I live!” “We’ve been really busy, Hag — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> started to say, but then <PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead, looking up at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, apparently lost for words.
For a moment, <PER>Hermione</PER> goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Erm — where are the skrewts?” “Out by the pumpkin patch,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> happily.
A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching <PER>Hagrid</PER> darning his socks and arguing with <PER>Hermione</PER> about house-elves — for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W.
By half past five it was growing dark, and <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast — and, more important, the announcement of the school champions.
Coughing, <PER>Ron</PER> said, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what’s that?” “Eh?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, turning around with a large bottle in his hand.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “And what’s with the hair and the suit?” said <PER>Harry</PER> in an undertone.
Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that <PER>Hagrid</PER> wouldn’t spot them, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from the Beauxbatons students's carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too.
They couldn’t hear what <PER>Hagrid</PER> was saying, but he was talking to Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression <PER>Harry</PER> had only ever seen <PER>Harry</PER> wear once before — when <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking at the baby dragon, Norbert.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s going up to the castle with her!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> indignantly.
“I thought <PER>Harry</PER> was waiting for us!” Without so much as a backward glance at <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin, <PER>Hagrid</PER> was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beauxbatons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.
<PER>Ron</PER> watched Viktor Krum excitedly, but Viktor Krum did not look around as Viktor Krum reached the front doors a little ahead of <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> and proceeded through them.
“Hope it’s Angelina,” said Fred as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down.
Perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as <PER>Harry</PER> would have normally.
Like everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had finished eating yet, <PER>Harry</PER> simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions.
At long last, the plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> caught the piece of parchment and held the piece of parchment at arm’s length, so that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber.
“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “is Fleur Delacour!” “It’s her, <PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!” “No!” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, but nobody heard him except <PER>Harry</PER>; the uproar from the next table was too great.
Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could make <PER>Dumbledore</PER> heard again.
There was a long pause, during which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared at the slip in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hands, and everyone in the room stared at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
And then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cleared <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s throat and read out — “ <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> sat, frozen, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
Up at the top table, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had got to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>; beyond them, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the long Gryffindor table all watching <PER>Harry</PER>, openmouthed.
At the top table, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had straightened up, nodding to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, trod on the hem of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, and stumbled slightly.
It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn’t seem to be getting any nearer at all, and <PER>Harry</PER> could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon <PER>Harry</PER>, as though each were a searchlight.
“Well through the door, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> went through the door out of the Great Hall and found <PER>Harry</PER> in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards.
The faces in the portraits turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> entered.
He took <PER>Harry</PER> by the arm and led <PER>Harry</PER> forward.
Cedric looked from Bagman to <PER>Harry</PER> and back again as though sure <PER>Harry</PER> must have misheard what Bagman had said.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> closed the door.
“Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!” Somewhere under <PER>Harry</PER>’s numb disbelief <PER>Harry</PER> felt a ripple of anger.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was now looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>, who looked right back at Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon spectacles.
“Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> was very aware of everybody watching <PER>Harry</PER> closely.
“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, ignoring <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was now shaking <PER>Snape</PER>'s head, <PER>Snape</PER>'s lip curling.
“<PER>Snape</PER> could not have crossed the Age Line,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> sharply.
“It is possible, of course,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> politely “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> angrily.
“I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody.” <PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was saying was barely worth <PER>Harry</PER>'s notice, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands gave him away; they had balled they into fists.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered for a moment whom <PER>Harry</PER> was speaking to, but then realized “Mad-Eye” could hardly be Moody’s real first name.
Close up, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> looked ill.
There were dark shadows beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and a thin, papery look about <PER>Harry</PER>'s wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling at both of <PER>Harry</PER>, Cedric.
The inside of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain had been ransacked.
“How did you get your name in?” “I didn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell Cedric didn’t believe <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood listening to <PER>Harry</PER> going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, <PER>Harry</PER> started to climb the marble ones.
Was anyone except <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> going to believe <PER>Harry</PER>, or would they all think him’d put <PER>Harry</PER> in for the tournament?
Yet how could anyone think that, when <PER>Harry</PER> was facing competitors who’d had three years’ more magical education than <PER>Harry</PER> had — when <PER>Harry</PER> was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people?
Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>’d thought about it <PER>Harry</PER>’d fantasized about it but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream he’d never really, seriously considered entering.
Yes, someone wanted <PER>Harry</PER> dead, someone had wanted <PER>Harry</PER> dead ever since <PER>Harry</PER> had been a year old Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
But how could <PER>Voldemort</PER> have ensured that <PER>Harry</PER>’s name got into the Goblet of Fire?
Yet in that dream <PER>Voldemort</PER> had had, just before <PER>Voldemort</PER> had awoken with <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar hurting, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not been alone <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been talking to Wormtail plotting <PER>Harry</PER>’s murder .
<PER>Harry</PER> got a shock to find <PER>Harry</PER> facing the Fat Lady already.
<PER>Harry</PER> had barely noticed where <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet were carrying <PER>Harry</PER>.
The blast of noise that met <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked <PER>Harry</PER> backward.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t get away; whenever <PER>Harry</PER> tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around <PER>Harry</PER> closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on <PER>Harry</PER>, stuffing crisps and peanuts into <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
Everyone wanted to know how <PER>Harry</PER> had done it, how <PER>Harry</PER> had tricked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Age Line and managed to get <PER>Harry</PER>'s name into the goblet.
“I didn’t,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, over and over again, “I don’t know how it happened.” But for all the notice anyone took, <PER>Harry</PER> might just as well not have answered at all.
“No, seriously, George — I’m going to bed — ” George — I wanted more than anything to find <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room.
Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, <PER>Harry</PER> managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
To his great relief, his found <PER>Ron</PER> was lying on his found <PER>Ron</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER>'s bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed.
He looked up when <PER>Harry</PER> slammed the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly became aware that <PER>Harry</PER> was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> lay on the bed without moving, watching <PER>Harry</PER> struggle to remove it.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, “To kill me.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into He's hair.
When <PER>Harry</PER> woke up on Sunday morning, it took <PER>Harry</PER> a moment to remember why <PER>Harry</PER> felt so miserable and worried.
He sat up and ripped back the curtains of He's own four-poster, intending to talk to <PER>Ron</PER>, to force <PER>Ron</PER> to believe He — only to find that <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed was empty; He had obviously gone down to breakfast.
It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> exactly what had happened after <PER>Harry</PER> had left the Gryffindor table the night before.
“What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’?” “Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, isn’t it obvious?” <PER>Hermione</PER> said despairingly.
“I know you don’t ask for it but — well — you know, <PER>Ron</PER>’s got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you’re <PER>Ron</PER>’s's best friend, and you’re really famous — <PER>Ron</PER>’s’s always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and <PER>Ron</PER>’s puts up with it, and <PER>Ron</PER>never mentions it, but I suppose this is just one time too many.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s going to find out anyway — ” “How?” <PER>Harry</PER>, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, very seriously.
“<PER>Harry</PER> told me not to use Hedwig again.” “Ask <PER>Ron</PER> if you can borrow — ” “I’m not asking <PER>Ron</PER> for anything,” <PER>Harry</PER> said flatly.
They went up to the Owlery <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a piece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches, looking at all the different owls, while <PER>Harry</PER> sat down against a wall and wrote <PER>Harry</PER>'s letter.
The other Hogwarts champion had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside The other Hogwarts champion's chest since last night, but The other Hogwarts champion couldn’t think how to translate this into words, so The other Hogwarts champion simply dipped The other Hogwarts champion's quill back into the ink bottle and wrote, Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak — <PER>Harry</PER> “Finished,” he told <PER>Hermione</PER>, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes.
She kept Shis back to <PER>Harry</PER> all the time <PER>Harry</PER> was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl.
“First <PER>Ron</PER>, then you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
“ This isn’t my fault.” If <PER>Harry</PER> had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of <PER>Harry</PER> being champion, the following day showed <PER>Harry</PER> how mistaken <PER>Harry</PER> was.
<PER>Harry</PER> could no longer avoid the rest of the school once <PER>Harry</PER> was back at lessons — and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought <PER>Harry</PER> had entered <PER>Harry</PER> for the tournament.
Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch- Fletchley, with whom <PER>Harry</PER> normally got on very well, did not talk to <PER>Harry</PER> even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from <PER>Harry</PER>’s grip and smacked <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the face.
<PER>Ron</PER> wasn’t talking to <PER>Harry</PER> either.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered <PER>Hermione</PER>'s normally, both avoided making eye contact with each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with <PER>Harry</PER> — but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have been looking forward to seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too — the first time <PER>Harry</PER> would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion.
Predictably, <PER>Malfoy</PER> arrived at <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place.
He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to <PER>Harry</PER> and said, very seriously, “So — yer competin’, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No idea who put yeh in fer it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s words.
“Yeh say it wasn’ you, an’ I believe yeh — an’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believes yer, an’ all.” “Wish I knew who did do it,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
<PER>Harry</PER> assumed <PER>Harry</PER> was talking about the skrewts, because <PER>Harry</PER>'s classmates certainly weren’t; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts’ ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.
“Ah, I don’ know, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> sighed suddenly, looking back down at <PER>Harry</PER> with a worried expression on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
Yes, everything did seem to happen to <PER>Harry</PER> that was more or less what <PER>Hermione</PER> had said as they had walked around the lake, and that was the reason, according to <PER>Hermione</PER>, that <PER>Ron</PER> was no longer talking to <PER>Harry</PER>.
He thought He could have coped with the rest of the school’s behavior if He could just have had <PER>Ron</PER> back as a friend, but He wasn’t going to try and persuade <PER>Ron</PER> to talk to He if <PER>Ron</PER> didn’t want to.
“It’s really not that difficult, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> tried to reassure him as they left Flitwick’s class — <PER>Hermione</PER> had been making objects zoom across the room to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s all lesson, as though <PER>Hermione</PER> were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes.
“You just weren’t concentrating properly “Wonder why that was,” said <PER>Harry</PER> darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER> were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt.
Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with <PER>Snape</PER> and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish <PER>Harry</PER> as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing <PER>Harry</PER> could imagine.
<PER>Harry</PER> had already struggled through one Friday’s worth, with <PER>Hermione</PER> sitting next to <PER>Harry</PER> intoning “ignore them, ignore them, ignore them” under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see why today should be any better.
When he and <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived at <PER>Snape</PER> ’s dungeon after lunch, he and <PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Hermione</PER> found the Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of he and <PER>Hermione</PER> wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes.
badges — then <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage: Support CEDRIC DIGGORY — The REAL Hogwarts Champion “Like them, Potter?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> loudly as <PER>Harry</PER> approached.
“And this isn’t all they do — look!” <PER>Harry</PER> pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s badge into <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowed green: The Slytherins howled with laughter.
“Oh very funny,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and Pansy Parkinson's gang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, “really witty.” <PER>Ron</PER> was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus.
“Want one, Granger?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, holding out a badge to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said warningly.
“Go on, then, Potter,” <PER>Malfoy</PER> said quietly, drawing out <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s own wand.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s front teeth — already larger than average — were now growing at an alarming rate; <PER>Hermione</PER> was looking more and more like a beaver as <PER>Hermione</PER>'s teeth elongated, past <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bottom lip, toward <PER>Hermione</PER>'s chin — panic-stricken, <PER>Hermione</PER> felt them and let out a terrified cry.
The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; <PER>Snape</PER> pointed a long yellow finger at <PER>Malfoy</PER> and said, “Explain.” “Potter attacked me, sir — ” “We attacked each other at the same time!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“ — and <PER>Snape</PER> hit Goyle — look — ” <PER>Snape</PER> examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> got <PER>Hermione</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> said.
“Loo!d” He forced <PER>Hermione</PER> to show <PER>Snape</PER> her teeth — she was doing shis best to hide them with shis hands, though this was difficult as them had now grown down past shis collar.
Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at <PER>Hermione</PER> from behind <PER>Snape</PER> ’s back.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked coldly at <PER>Hermione</PER>, then said, “I see no difference.” <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a whimper; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes filled with tears, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.
It was lucky, perhaps, that both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> started shouting at <PER>Snape</PER> at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him.
<PER>Snape</PER> passed <PER>Snape</PER>, walked with <PER>Ron</PER> to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table.
<PER>Ron</PER> was shaking with anger too — for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal between them, but then <PER>Ron</PER> turned and sat down with Dean and Seamus instead, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> alone at <PER>Harry</PER>'s table.
On the other side of the dungeon, <PER>Malfoy</PER> turned his back on <PER>Snape</PER> and pressed his badge, smirking.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat there staring at <PER>Snape</PER> as the lesson began, picturing horrific things happening to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was going to poison <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> imagined picking up <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on <PER>Snape</PER>’s greasy head — And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts.
It was Colin Creevey; Colin Creevey edged into the room, beaming at <PER>Harry</PER>, and walked up to <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk at the front of the room.
“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take <PER>Harry</PER> Potter upstairs.” <PER>Snape</PER> stared down sir's hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from sir's eager face.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly.
He chanced half a glance at <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was staring determinedly at the ceiling.
“Potter — take your bag and get out of my sight!” <PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, got up, and headed for the door.
“It’s amazing, isn’t it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said Colin, starting to speak the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had closed the dungeon door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“She’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet ” “Maybe not that small, Ludo,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, her eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I wonder if I could have a little word with <PER>Harry</PER> before we start?” she said to Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That is — if <PER>Harry</PER> has no objection?” “Er — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Lovely,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had <PER>Harry</PER>’s upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and her was steering <PER>Harry</PER> out of the room again and opening a nearby door.
“Come along, dear — that’s right — lovely,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing <PER>Harry</PER> down onto a cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them into darkness.
“Testing my name is <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked down quickly at the quill.
The moment <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had spoken, the quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment: Attractive blonde <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, forty-three, whose savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations “Lovely,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, yet again, and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled the top piece of parchment up, and stuffed the top piece of parchment into <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's handbag.
Now <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter leaned toward <PER>Harry</PER> and said, “So, <PER>Harry</PER> what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament?” “Er — ” said <PER>Harry</PER> again, but <PER>Harry</PER> was distracted by the quill.
Even though <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in it wake <PER>Harry</PER> could make out a fresh sentence: An ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, whose eyes “Ignore the quill, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter firmly.
Reluctantly, <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's instead.
“Now — why did you decide to enter the tournament, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “I didn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ <PER>Dumbledore</PER>l” cried <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, with every appearance of delight — but <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess Remover, and <PER>Rita</PER>’s clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodile-skin bag.
“I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and that many wizards in the street — ” “I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, <PER>Rita</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, with a courteous bow and a smile, “but I’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter settled <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter down in a corner; <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's slip the parchment out of <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's bag again, spread the parchment on <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment on <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter.
<PER>Harry</PER> had met Mister Ollivander before — <PER>Harry</PER> was the wand-maker from whom <PER>Harry</PER> had bought <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley.
“One of my grandmuzzer’s.” So Fleur was part veela, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, making a mental note to tell <PER>Ron</PER> then <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Ron</PER> wasn’t speaking to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> gathered a fistful of robe from <PER>Harry</PER>'s knee and tried to rub a fistful of robe from <PER>Harry</PER>'s knee clean surreptitiously.
“Which leaves Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and walked past Krum to Mister Ollivander.
<PER>Harry</PER> handed over <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last <PER>Harry</PER> had found the one that suited <PER>Harry</PER> — this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix.
“Curious,” he had said, “curious,” and not until <PER>Harry</PER> asked what was curious had Mister Ollivander explained that the phoenix feather in <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very fond of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and as far as <PER>Harry</PER> was concerned its relation to <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand was something it couldn’t help — rather as <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help being related to Aunt Petunia.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a funny feeling <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill did.
Eventually, however, <PER>Harry</PER> made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to <PER>Harry</PER>, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.
“You may go back to your lessons now — or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end — ” Feeling that at last something had gone right today, <PER>Harry</PER> got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“All the judges and champions, what do you think, <PER>Rita</PER>?” “Er — yes, let’s do those first,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, whose eyes were upon <PER>Harry</PER> again.
The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging <PER>Harry</PER> into greater prominence.
<PER>Hermione</PER> wasn’t there — <PER>Harry</PER> supposed <PER>Hermione</PER> was still in the hospital wing having <PER>Hermione</PER>'s teeth fixed.
— <PER>Harry</PER> ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that — <PER>Harry</PER> had to do.
Up in the dormitory, <PER>Harry</PER> came across <PER>Ron</PER>.
“And we’ve got to do we detentions tomorrow night, <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> then walked straight out of the room, not looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> considered going after <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure whether <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to talk to <PER>Harry</PER> or hit <PER>Harry</PER>, both seemed quite appealing — but the lure of Sirius’s answer was too strong.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never suffered nerves like these; these were way beyond anything <PER>Harry</PER> had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even He's last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup.
<PER>Harry</PER> was finding it hard to think about the future at all; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s whole life had been leading up to, and would finish with, the first task.
Admittedly, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t see how Sirius was going to make <PER>Harry</PER> feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> wrote back to Sirius saying that <PER>Harry</PER> would be beside the common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question.
In the meantime, life became even worse for <PER>Harry</PER> within the confines of the castle, for <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had published <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of <PER>Harry</PER>; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about <PER>Harry</PER>, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.
the article had appeared ten days ago, and <PER>Harry</PER> still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach every time <PER>Harry</PER> thought about it.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had reported <PER>Harry</PER> saying an awful lot of things that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t remember ever saying in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, let alone in that broom cupboard.
But <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had gone even further than transforming <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's “er’s” into long, sickly sentences: <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had interviewed other people about him too.
<PER>Harry</PER> close friend, Colin Creevey, says that <PER>Harry</PER> is rarely seen out of the company of one <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger, a stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like <PER>Harry</PER>, is one of the top students in the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, <PER>Harry</PER> had had to endure people — Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> passed and making sneering comments.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt the color rising in <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had come in for <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fair share of unpleasantness too, but <PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact, <PER>Harry</PER> was full of admiration for the way <PER>Hermione</PER> was handling the situation.
“What was she judging against — a chipmunk?” “Ignore it,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said in a dignified voice, holding <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head in the air and stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though <PER>Hermione</PER> couldn’t hear the sniggering Slytherin girls.
“Just ignore it, <PER>Harry</PER>.” But <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t ignore it.
<PER>Ron</PER> hadn’t spoken to <PER>Harry</PER> at all since <PER>Harry</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> about <PER>Snape</PER>’s detentions.
<PER>Harry</PER> had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats’ brains in <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, but that had been the day <PER>Rita</PER>’s article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed <PER>Ron</PER>’s belief that <PER>Harry</PER> was really enjoying all the attention.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was furious with the pair of them; <PER>Hermione</PER> went from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but <PER>Harry</PER> was adamant: <PER>Harry</PER> would talk to <PER>Ron</PER> again only if <PER>Ron</PER> admitted that <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t put his name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for calling him a liar.
<PER>Harry</PER> liked <PER>Hermione</PER> very much, but <PER>Hermione</PER> just wasn’t the same as <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t mastered Summoning Charms, <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and <PER>Hermione</PER> insisted that learning the theory would help.
Viktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered what <PER>Harry</PER> was up to.
<PER>Hermione</PER> often complained about Krum being there — not that he ever bothered them — but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves, and <PER>Hermione</PER> found the noise distracting.
Quite apart from liking to get Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine <PER>Ron</PER>’s expression if him another pang could have heard <PER>Hermione</PER> talking about Wonky- Faints.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s feeling of barely controlled panic was with <PER>Harry</PER> wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went, as everpresent as the snide comments about the Daily Prophet article.
<PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> that it would do <PER>Harry</PER> good to get away from the castle for a bit, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need much persuasion.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, this is so stupid — ” “I’ll come, but I’m not meeting <PER>Ron</PER>, and I’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak.” “Oh all right then ” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped, “but I hate talking to you in that cloak, I never know if I’m looking at you or not.” So <PER>Harry</PER> put on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory, went back downstairs, and together he and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off for Hogsmeade.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt wonderfully free under the cloak; <PER>Harry</PER> watched other students walking past them as them entered the village, most of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory\ badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and nobody was quoting that stupid article.
“Look behind you.” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's photographer friend had just emerged from the Three Broomsticks pub.
Talking in low voices, they passed right by <PER>Hermione</PER> without looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> backed into the wall of Honeydukes to stop <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter from hitting him with <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's crocodile-skin handbag.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t mention this; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t discussed what was coming in the first task much; <PER>Harry</PER> had the feeling she didn’t want to think about it.
“She’s gone,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking right through <PER>Harry</PER> toward the end of the street.
<PER>Harry</PER> edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while <PER>Hermione</PER> went to buy drinks.
On his way through the pub, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted <PER>Ron</PER>, who was sitting with Fred, George, and Lee Jordan.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s names at the top of the very short list.
<PER>Harry</PER> took a swig of butterbeer under <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak.
<PER>Hermione</PER> lapsed into thoughtful silence, while <PER>Harry</PER> drank <PER>Harry</PER>'s butterbeer, watching the people in the pub.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest seemed to ease slightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> would be speaking to <PER>Harry</PER> in just over twelve hours, for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common room fire — assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately.
“Look, it’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t spotted <PER>Harry</PER> at once, as <PER>Hagrid</PER> was so large, but standing up carefully, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody.
As <PER>Harry</PER> watched, he saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Moody get up to leave.
<PER>Harry</PER> tapped <PER>Hagrid</PER> in the small of the back (being unable to reach <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder), muttered something to <PER>Harry</PER>, and then the pair of them made them's way back across the pub toward <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s table.
“All right, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> loudly.
Moody limped around the table and bent down; <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was reading the S.P.E.W.
notebook, until <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, “Nice cloak, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER> in amazement.
“And it’s come in useful at times, I can tell you.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> was beaming down at <PER>Harry</PER> too.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Hagrid</PER> couldn’t see him, but Moody had obviously told <PER>Hagrid</PER> he was there.
notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only <PER>Harry</PER> could hear it, “<PER>Harry</PER>, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin.
“Why does <PER>Hagrid</PER> want me to meet him at midnight?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, very surprised.
he was very curious to know what this might be; <PER>Hagrid</PER> had never asked <PER>Harry</PER> to visit <PER>Harry</PER> so late at night.
<PER>Harry</PER> crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> opened the Fat Lady for <PER>Harry</PER> from outside as they had planned.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was also lit up; <PER>Harry</PER> could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as Madame Maxime knocked on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s front door.
“You there, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> whispered, opening the door and looking around.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“What’re you showing me?” — <PER>Harry</PER> said warily, wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or <PER>Hagrid</PER> had managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a stranger in a pub.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried to follow and found, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s great surprise, that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what — ?” “Shhh!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wands.
Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, <PER>Hagrid</PER> offered her his arm, and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime ’s giant winged horses, with <PER>Harry</PER>, totally bewildered, running to keep up with them.
Had <PER>Hagrid</PER> could see her any old time Had <PER>Hagrid</PER> wanted her wasn’t exactly hard to miss.
But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as <PER>Harry</PER>, because after a while she said playfully, “Wair is it you are taking me, ’Agrid?” “Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> gruffly, “worth seem’, trust me.
And still they walked, <PER>Harry</PER> getting more and more irritated as <PER>Harry</PER> jogged along in their wake, checking <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch every now and then.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried up alongside them — for a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them — and then his mouth fell open.
Mesmerized, <PER>Harry</PER> looked up, high above <PER>Harry</PER>, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat’s, bulging with either fear or rage, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t tell which.
“Keep back there, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain <PER>Hagrid</PER>!
“Stunning Spells, on the count of three!” <PER>Harry</PER> saw each of the dragon keepers pull out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the ground with a thud that — <PER>Harry</PER> could have sworn made the trees behind — <PER>Harry</PER> quake.
The wizard who had warned <PER>Hagrid</PER> not to come any closer turned, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized who it was: Charlie Weasley.
Then he said, “How’s <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Fine,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; <PER>Harry</PER> had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t remember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than <PER>Harry</PER> did right now — when, without warning, <PER>Harry</PER> ran into something very solid.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell backward, <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses askew, clutching the cloak around <PER>Harry</PER>.
Very slowly and very carefully, <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and set off again as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back toward Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER> had sneaked off <PER>Harry</PER>'s ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be.
<PER>Harry</PER> might even have spotted <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Madame Maxime heading off around the forest together — they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance and now all Karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would know what was in store for the champions.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the marble stairs; <PER>Harry</PER> was very out of breath, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t dare slow down.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw <PER>Harry</PER> into an armchair in front of the fire.
“I’m — ” For a second, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to say “fine” — but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t do it.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was talking more than he’d talked in days — about how no one believed <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t entered the tournament of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own free will, how <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had lied about <PER>Harry</PER> in the Daily Prophet, how <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t walk down a corridor without being sneered at — and about <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> not believing him, <PER>Ron</PER>’s jealousy " and now <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s just shown me what’s coming in the first task, and it’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a goner,” <PER>Harry</PER> finished desperately.
He had let <PER>Harry</PER> talk <PER>Harry</PER> into silence without interruption, but now <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Dragons we can deal with, <PER>Harry</PER>, but we’ll get to that in a minute — I haven’t got long here I’ve broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any time.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was a Death Eater.
“Exactly she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was rumored to be last and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?” “Yeah, but it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into <PER>Voldemort</PER>, is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, <PER>Ron</PER> stopped dead facing <PER>Harry</PER> across the room, and looked around.
He knew that <PER>Ron</PER> had no idea what He’d walked in on, knew He hadn’t done it on purpose, but He didn’t care — at this moment He hated everything about <PER>Ron</PER>, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath He's pajama trousers.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before <PER>Harry</PER> realized <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to pull <PER>Harry</PER>'s hat onto his foot instead of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sock.
When <PER>Harry</PER>’d finally got all <PER>Harry</PER>'s clothes on the right parts of <PER>Harry</PER>'s body, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried off to find <PER>Hermione</PER>, locating <PER>Hermione</PER>'s at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where <PER>Hermione</PER> was eating breakfast with <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Feeling too queasy to eat, <PER>Harry</PER> waited until <PER>Hermione</PER> had swallowed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s last spoonful of porridge, then dragged <PER>Hermione</PER>'s out onto the grounds.
There, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>'s all about the dragons, and about everything Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake.
Here, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled down every book <PER>Harry</PER> could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching through the large pile.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, we’ll go back to the common room <PER>Harry</PER>'s fan club’ll be here in a moment, twittering away.
When <PER>Harry</PER> awoke on Monday morning, <PER>Harry</PER> seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts.
But as <PER>Harry</PER> looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would mean, <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t do it.
It was the only place <PER>Harry</PER> had ever been happy well, <PER>Harry</PER> supposed <PER>Harry</PER> must have been happy with <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents too, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t remember that.
Somehow, the knowledge that <PER>Harry</PER> would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with <PER>Dudley</PER> was good to know; it made <PER>Harry</PER> feel slightly calmer.
<PER>Harry</PER> finished <PER>Harry</PER>'s bacon with difficulty (He throat wasn’t working too well), and as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> got up, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff table.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I’ll see you in the greenhouses,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, coming to <PER>Harry</PER>'s decision as <PER>Harry</PER> watched Cedric leaving the Hall.
“Go on, I’ll catch you up.” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring — ” “I’ll catch you up, okay?” By the time <PER>Harry</PER> reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric was at the top.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s article at him every time him went near them.
Pausing at a distance from them, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and took careful aim.
He stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> in disbelief.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure Cedric wouldn’t have asked that if <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the dragons himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have let <PER>Harry</PER>'s worst enemy face those monsters unprepared — well, perhaps <PER>Malfoy</PER> or <PER>Snape</PER> “It’s just fair, isn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to Cedric.
“We all know now we’re on an even footing, aren’t we?” Cedric was still looking at Cedric in a slightly suspicious way when <PER>Harry</PER> heard a familiar clunking noise behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
Would Moody go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and tell on <PER>Hagrid</PER>, or just turn <PER>Harry</PER> into a ferret?
Well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, <PER>Harry</PER> thought dully, <PER>Harry</PER>’d be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet <PER>Harry</PER> followed Moody into <PER>Harry</PER>'s office.
Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the reaction <PER>Harry</PER> had expected at all.
Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that <PER>Harry</PER> supposed Moody had used in the days when <PER>Harry</PER> had been an Auror.
On his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked, glass spinning top; <PER>Harry</PER> recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because <PER>Harry</PER> owned one his, though it was much smaller than Moody’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered what was in there, until Moody’s next question brought <PER>Harry</PER> sharply back to earth.
He’d been afraid of this — but <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t told Cedric, and <PER>Harry</PER> certainly wasn’t going to tell Moody, that <PER>Hagrid</PER> had broken the rules.
“You’re a damn good flier from what I’ve heard.” “Yeah, but ” <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m not allowed a broom, I’ve only got my wand — ” “My second piece of general advice,” said Moody loudly, interrupting Moody, “is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> blankly.
And for his Firebolt, his needed — “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, when <PER>Harry</PER> had sped into greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as <PER>Harry</PER> passed her.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> — I need you to help me.” “What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
they didn’t have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where <PER>Harry</PER> tried with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might to make various objects fly across the room toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, that’s good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper getting the better of <PER>Harry</PER>, “just as long as it’s not drawn-out.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty.
At two o’clock in the morning, <PER>Harry</PER> stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and <PER>Neville</PER>’s toad, Trevor.
“That’s better, <PER>Harry</PER>, that’s loads better,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, looking exhausted but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, throwing a rune dictionary back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, so <PER>Harry</PER> could try again, “threaten me with a dragon.
“Accio Dictionary !” The heavy book soared out of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s hand, flew across the room, and <PER>Harry</PER> caught it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I really think you’ve got it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> delightedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt oddly separate from everyone around <PER>Harry</PER>, whether they were wishing <PER>Harry</PER> good luck or hissing “ We’ll have a box of tissues ready, Potted as he passed.
“Good luck, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“Yes, I’m fine.” She was leading <PER>Harry</PER> toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when the dragons approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.
When <PER>Harry</PER> entered, Cedric gave <PER>Harry</PER> a small smile, which <PER>Harry</PER> returned, feeling the muscles in <PER>Harry</PER>'s face working rather hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it.
Knowing what was left, <PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four.
“No, I’m fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wondering why <PER>Harry</PER> kept telling people this, and wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> had ever been less fine.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to wish <PER>Harry</PER> luck as <PER>Harry</PER> walked past, but all that came out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.
Horrible pictures formed in <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind as he heard: “Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” “He’s taking risks, this one!” “Clever move — pity it didn’t work!” And then, after about fifteen minutes, <PER>Harry</PER> heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past Cedric's dragon and captured the golden egg.
“Miss Delacour, if you please!” Fleur was trembling from head to foot; <PER>Harry</PER> felt more warmly toward her than <PER>Harry</PER> had done so far as her left the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt much more aware of <PER>Harry</PER>'s body than usual; very aware of the way <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was pumping fast, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers tingling with fear yet at the same time, <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to be outside <PER>Harry</PER>, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away.
It was time to do what <PER>Harry</PER> had to do to focus <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited, every fiber of <PER>Harry</PER> hoping, praying.
If it hadn’t worked if it wasn’t coming <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to be looking at everything around <PER>Harry</PER> through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around <PER>Harry</PER> swim strangely.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> heard it, speeding through the air behind <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> turned and saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt hurtling toward <PER>Harry</PER> around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside <PER>Harry</PER>, waiting for <PER>Harry</PER> to mount.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground.
“Are you watching this, Mister Krum?” <PER>Harry</PER> soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following Mister Krum?”'s progress; its head revolving on its long neck — if Mister Krum?” kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy — but better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again — <PER>Harry</PER> plummeted just as the Horntail opened the Horntail mouth, but this time — <PER>Harry</PER> was less lucky — — <PER>Harry</PER> missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet — <PER>Harry</PER> instead, and as — <PER>Harry</PER> swerved to the left, one of the long spikes grazed — <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, ripping — <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes — — <PER>Harry</PER> could feel it stinging, — <PER>Harry</PER> could hear screaming and groans from the crowd, but the cut didn’t seem to be deep.
Now — <PER>Harry</PER> zoomed around the back of the Horntail, and a possibility occurred to — <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was like a fly to her, a fly her was longing to swat; her tail thrashed again, but <PER>Harry</PER> was too high to reach now.
“Come on,” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her, “come on, come and get me up you get now ” And then her reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings at last, as wide as those of a small airplane — and <PER>Harry</PER> dived.
He got to He's feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before He’d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside — <PER>Hermione</PER>, followed closely by <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you were brilliant!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said squeakily.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, very seriously, “whoever put your name in that goblet — I — I reckon they’re trying to do you in!” It was as though the last few weeks had never happened — as though <PER>Harry</PER> were meeting <PER>Ron</PER> for the first time, right after he’d been made champion.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> was about to apologize and suddenly <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need to hear it.
“Forget it.” “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “I shouldn’t’ve — ” “ Forget it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
<PER>Ron</PER> grinned nervously at <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> grinned back.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, c’mon, <PER>Harry</PER>, c’mon’ll be putting up your scores.
“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER>, squinting up the field, saw the first judge — Madame Maxime — raise her wand in the air.
“Looking good!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, thumping <PER>Harry</PER> on the back.
He grinned at <PER>Harry</PER> when He saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Good one, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “And you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning back.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was wearing acid-green robes today; the Quick-Quotes Quill in <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's hand blended perfectly against them.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that <PER>Harry</PER> could send Sirius a letter telling <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to get past <PER>Harry</PER>'s dragon unscathed.
On the way, <PER>Harry</PER> filled <PER>Ron</PER> in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff.
“Remember what <PER>Malfoy</PER> said on the train, about <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s dad being friends with Karkaroff?
<PER>Ron</PER> snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while <PER>Harry</PER> attached the letter to <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arms, and frowned at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s got a long way to go before <PER>Harry</PER> finishes this tournament,” she said seriously.
They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “Well, we’d better get downstairs for your surprise party, <PER>Harry</PER> — Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now.” Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again.
<PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to food; <PER>Harry</PER> had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe how happy <PER>Harry</PER> felt; <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Ron</PER> back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s side, He’d gotten through the first task, and <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have to face the second one for three months.
“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which <PER>Harry</PER> had left on a table, and weighing it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
Lee passed <PER>Harry</PER> the egg, and <PER>Harry</PER> dug <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed — ” Within a minute, however, <PER>Neville</PER> had molted, and once <PER>Neville</PER>'s feathers had fallen off, <PER>Neville</PER> reappeared looking entirely normal.
“George and I invented them — seven Sickles each, a bargain!” It was nearly one in the morning when <PER>Harry</PER> finally went up to the dormitory with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, Seamus, and Dean.
Before he pulled the curtains of his four- poster shut, <PER>Harry</PER> set <PER>Harry</PER>'s tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed it eyes.
Really, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the hangings on <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster closed, <PER>Hagrid</PER> had a point they were all right, really, dragons.
Drafty though the castle always was in winter, <PER>Harry</PER> was glad of its fires and thick walls every time <PER>Harry</PER> passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing against the dark skies.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime’s horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the corner of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed.
Most of the class — <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead — had fled into <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Don’ frighten him, now!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> shouted as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back.
“Jus’ try an’ slip the rope ’round his sting, so his won’ hurt any o’ the others!” “Yeah, we wouldn’t want that!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted angrily as he and <PER>Harry</PER> backed into the wall of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks.
“Well, well, well this does look like fun.” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was leaning on <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s garden fence, looking in at the mayhem.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's crocodile-skin handbag was over <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's arm.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby.
“Who ’re you?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> asked <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt’s sting and tightened it.
“<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,” <PER>Rita</PER> replied, beaming at him.
“Thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said you weren’ allowed inside the school anymore,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, frowning slightly as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.
<PER>Rita</PER> acted as though she hadn’t heard what <PER>Hagrid</PER> had said.
“I’ve never heard of them before where do them come from?” <PER>Harry</PER> noticed a dull red flush rising up out of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s wild black beard, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart sank.
“Ah, you’re here, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter as <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter looked around.
“Er — yeah, why not?” <PER>Harry</PER> had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to <PER>Hagrid</PER> without <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter seeing, so <PER>Harry</PER> had to stand and watch in silence as <PER>Hagrid</PER> and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week.
“Well, good-bye, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Until Friday night, then, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” “Shell twist everything he says,” <PER>Harry</PER> said under his breath.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s been in loads of trouble before, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s never sacked him,” said <PER>Ron</PER> consolingly.
<PER>Harry</PER> thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again.
<PER>Harry</PER> fought hard to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s face straight.
<PER>Ron</PER> hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in whispers with <PER>Harry</PER> whether <PER>Harry</PER> should ask for an autograph — but then <PER>Ron</PER> realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.
“Wonder where she’s got to?” <PER>Ron</PER> said as he and <PER>Harry</PER> went back to Gryffindor Tower.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve got to come — you’ve got to come, the most amazing thing’s happened — please — ” the Fat Lady seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and started to try to drag <PER>Harry</PER> back along the corridor.
“I’ll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>; quick <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>, intrigued.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, where are we going?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, after <PER>Hermione</PER> had led them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and <PER>Harry</PER>’s names.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed <PER>Hermione</PER> down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, they found they in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food.
He nudged <PER>Ron</PER> and pointed to the painting just behind <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, cottoning on.
“And it’s not spew, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “Changed the name, have you?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, frowning at her.
“I came down here just now, to talk to them all, and I found — oh come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, I want to show you!” She seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm again, pulled <PER>Harry</PER> in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl, stretched out Shis forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear.
<PER>Hermione</PER> seized It, pulled the door open, and pushed <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the back, forcing <PER>Harry</PER> inside.
<PER>Harry</PER> had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high- ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward <PER>Harry</PER> from the middle of the room, squealing, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir!
“Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter has come to see him, sir!” Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at <PER>Harry</PER>, Dobby's enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness.
One of these, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, was the black one <PER>Harry</PER> had removed from <PER>Harry</PER>'s own foot and tricked Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!” “Winky?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“She’s here too?” “Yes, sir, yes!” said Dobby, and sir seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there.
Each of these tables, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed as <PER>Harry</PER> passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the Great Hall.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had followed <PER>Harry</PER> and Dobby to the end of the kitchen.
Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, said, “Good for you, Dobby!” “Thank you, miss!” said Dobby, grinning toothily at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hastily dropped down to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knees beside <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and tried to comfort <PER>Hermione</PER>, but nothing <PER>Hermione</PER> said made the slightest difference.
“And Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying!
“Dobby likes Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for his.” “But you can say what you like about the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s now?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“Dobby could tell <PER>Harry</PER> Potter that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards'.” Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror- struck by Dobby's own daring — then Dobby rushed over to the nearest table and began banging Dobby's head on it very hard, squealing, “ Bad Dobby !
“You is seeing Mister Crouch here at Hogwarts?” “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “he and Mister Bagman are judges in the Tri-wizard Tournament.” “Mister Bagman comes too?” squeaked Winky, and to <PER>Harry</PER>’s great surprise (and <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again.
“Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!
<PER>Hermione</PER> refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies.
“You know what?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, once he, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again.
“Oh shell cheer up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> sounded a bit doubtful.
“Once the shock’s worn off, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s got used to Hogwarts, <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll see how much better off <PER>Hermione</PER> is without that Crouch man.” “she seems to love him,” said <PER>Ron</PER> thickly (him had just started on a cream cake) .
“Wonder what Crouch says at home about Crouch?” “Probably says Crouch’s not a very good Head of Department,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “and let’s face it Crouch’s got a point, hasn’t Crouch?” “I’d still rather work for Crouch than old Crouch,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s desk (<PER>Neville</PER>’s still had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the blackboard (“Describe, with examples, the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross-Species Switches”).
The bell was due to ring at any moment, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George’s fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, <PER>Ron</PER> holding a tin parrot and <PER>Harry</PER>, a rubber haddock.
“Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act Potter and Weasley's age,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of <PER>Harry</PER>’s haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor — <PER>Ron</PER>’s parrot’s beak had severed <PER>Ron</PER>’s parrot’s beak moments before — “I have something to say to you all.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> ignored them, which <PER>Harry</PER> thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see what was funny this time: Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as though her had never let her hair down in any sense.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then said, “Potter, the champions and their partners — ” “What partners?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked suspiciously at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, as though she thought Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was trying to be funny.
“Dance partners?” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> going red.
But now that <PER>Harry</PER> had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER>’d rather have another round with the dragon.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never known so many people to put so many people's names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; <PER>Harry</PER> always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but <PER>Harry</PER> had always been very much in the minority before now.
This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> to be obsessed with the coming ball — or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; <PER>Harry</PER> had never quite noticed that before.
“Why do they have to move in packs?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well whom <PER>Harry</PER>’d like to ask, but working up the nerve was something else.
<PER>Cho</PER> was a year older than <PER>Cho</PER> was; <PER>Cho</PER> was very pretty; <PER>Cho</PER> was a very good Quidditch player, and <PER>Cho</PER> was also very popular.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed to know what was going on inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
Moreover, to <PER>Harry</PER>’s amazement, <PER>Harry</PER>’s turned out to be quite right.
A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom <PER>Harry</PER> had never spoken in his life asked <PER>Harry</PER> to go to the ball with A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom <PER>Harry</PER> had never spoken in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ['s] the very next day.
<PER>Harry</PER> was so taken aback <PER>Harry</PER> said no before he’d even stopped to consider the matter.
The girl walked off looking rather hurt, and <PER>Harry</PER> had to endure Dean’s, Seamus’s, and <PER>Ron</PER>’s taunts about her all through History of Magic.
The following day, two more girls asked <PER>Harry</PER>, a second year and (to <PER>Harry</PER>'s horror) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if him refused.
“They only like him because him’s famous!” <PER>Harry</PER> doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be <PER>Harry</PER>'s partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with <PER>Harry</PER> if <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t been a school champion.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> wondered if this would bother him if <PER>Cho</PER> asked him.
On the whole, <PER>Harry</PER> had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before <PER>Harry</PER>, life had definitely improved since <PER>Harry</PER> had got through the first task.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which <PER>Harry</PER> suspected had a lot to do with Cedric — <PER>Harry</PER> had an idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave <PER>Harry</PER> alone, in gratitude for <PER>Harry</PER>’s tip-off about the dragons.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, of course, was still quoting <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s article to <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> at every possible opportunity, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it — and just to heighten <PER>Harry</PER>’s feeling of well-being, no story about <PER>Hagrid</PER> had appeared in the Daily Prophet “She didn’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> asked him how him's interview with <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term.
“She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> continued in a low voice.
“yeh can’t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get boring.” “yeh wants a new angle, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> wisely as he shelled salamander eggs.
“You were supposed to say <PER>Harry</PER>’s a mad delinquent!” “But <PER>Harry</PER>’s not!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking genuinely shocked.
“She should’ve interviewed <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grimly.
“Well, yeh might’ve bent a few rules, <PER>Harry</PER>, bu’ yeh’re all righ’ really, aren’ you?” “Cheers, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t believe half of them — for instance, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta.
Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know, never having had access to a wizard’s wireless, but <PER>Harry</PER> deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group.
Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when them's minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to <PER>Harry</PER> about the perfect Summoning Charm <PER>Harry</PER> had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament.
Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Moody kept them working until the very last second of them's classes too, and <PER>Snape</PER>, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s Christmas, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> lazily; <PER>Harry</PER> was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire.
“I’d have thought you’d be doing something constructive, <PER>Harry</PER>, even if you don’t want to learn your antidotes!” “Like what?” <PER>Harry</PER> said as <PER>Harry</PER> watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser.
“Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’ve got till February the twenty- fourth,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
<PER>Harry</PER> had put the golden egg upstairs in <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and hadn’t opened the golden egg since the celebration party after the first task.
“You’re going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don’t!” “Leave him alone, <PER>Hermione</PER>, him’s earned a bit of a break,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and him placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing him's eyebrows.
They sat down at the table with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> felt how much damage had been done.
“There you go,” said Fred to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, “piece of cake.” He got to He's feet, yawning, and said, “We’d better use a school owl then, George, come on.
<PER>Ron</PER> stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“So basically, you’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have you, even if <PER>Hermione</PER>’s completely horrible?” “Er — yeah, that sounds about right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I’m going to bed,” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped, and <PER>Hermione</PER> swept off toward the girls’ staircase without another word.
When the decorations went up, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that the decorations were the most stunning <PER>Harry</PER> had yet seen inside the school.
And still, <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t asked <PER>Cho</PER> to the ball.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were getting very nervous now, though as <PER>Harry</PER> pointed out, <PER>Ron</PER> would look much less stupid than he would without a partner; <PER>Harry</PER> was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — we’ve just got to grit we teeth and do it,” said <PER>Ron</PER> on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress.
“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and he dashed off upstairs.
<PER>Cho</PER> hurried off through the packed corridors looking for <PER>Cho</PER>, and (rather sooner than <PER>Cho</PER> had expected) <PER>Cho</PER> found <PER>Cho</PER>, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.
— <PER>Cho</PER> said, “Okay,” and followed him out of earshot of — <PER>Cho</PER>'s classmates.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to look at her and <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach gave a weird lurch as though <PER>Harry</PER> had missed a step going downstairs.
<PER>Cho</PER> stood there looking puzzled, watching <PER>Cho</PER>.
The words came out before <PER>Harry</PER> had quite got <PER>Harry</PER>'s tongue around them.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m really sorry,” and <PER>Cho</PER> truly looked it.
They stood there looking at each other, and then <PER>Cho</PER> said, “Well — ” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> called after <PER>Cho</PER>, before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
Entering the common room, <PER>Harry</PER> looked around, and to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surprise <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> sitting ashen-faced in a distant corner.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was sitting with <PER>Harry</PER>, talking to <PER>Harry</PER> in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.
“What’s up, <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, joining them.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked up at <PER>Harry</PER>, a sort of blind horror in his face.
<PER>Ginny</PER> looked as though <PER>Ginny</PER> was fighting back a smile, but <PER>Ginny</PER> kept patting <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm sympathetically.
“I asked her to go with me just now,” <PER>Harry</PER> said dully, “and her told me.” <PER>Ginny</PER> had suddenly stopped smiling.
That shut <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> up.
“Thanks a bunch, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sourly.
“All the good-looking ones taken, <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> loftily.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>’s right — you are a girl.
“Oh come on,” he said impatiently, “we need partners, we’re going to look really stupid if we haven’t got any, everyone else has ” “I can’t come with you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now blushing, “because I’m already going with someone.” “No, you’re not!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You just said that to get rid of <PER>Neville</PER>!” “Oh did I?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes flashed dangerously.
“Just because it’s taken you three years to notice, <PER>Ron</PER>, doesn’t mean no one else has spotted I’m a girl!” <PER>Ron</PER> stared at her.
<PER>Ron</PER> goggled at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited for them to subside, <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers crossed in the pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with <PER>Ron</PER>?” he said, lowering his voice so that <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn’t hear.
Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays, <PER>Harry</PER> was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying <PER>Harry</PER> as fully as possible along with everyone else.
<PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t forgotten <PER>Dudley</PER> and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.
“It is too ’eavy, all zis ’Ogwarts food,” they heard her saying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening (<PER>Ron</PER> skulking behind <PER>Harry</PER>, keen not to be spotted by Fleur).
“She really thinks a lot of She, that one, doesn’t She?” “<PER>Hermione</PER> — who are you going to the ball with?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> scathingly, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> went up the marble staircase laughing heartily.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>, suddenly frowning, “your teeth ” “What about them?” <PER>Hermione</PER> said.
“Here — take it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> added in an undertone as the third-year girls scuttled away looking scandalized.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow, and <PER>Harry</PER> read out: Dear <PER>Harry</PER>, Congratulations on getting past the Horntail.
Sirius “He sounds exactly like Moody,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, tucking the letter away again inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Want a game of chess, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yeah, okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Wondering what had caused <PER>Harry</PER>'s abrupt return to consciousness, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, and saw something with very large, round, green eyes staring back at <PER>Harry</PER> in the darkness, so close they were almost nose to nose.
“Dobbyl” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast <PER>Harry</PER> almost fell out of bed.
His yell had awoken <PER>Ron</PER>, Seamus, Dean, and <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, Dean, and <PER>Neville</PER> decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present-opening too.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed, still looking worried that <PER>Harry</PER> had upset <PER>Harry</PER>.
The reason they were extra-knobbly was that <PER>Harry</PER> had been using they to cushion <PER>Harry</PER>'s Sneakoscope for over a year now.
“Dobby knew Sir must be a great wizard, for Sir is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that Dobby was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless — ” “They’re only socks,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same.
“Wow, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Harry</PER> — ” had just opened <PER>Harry</PER>’s present, a Chudley Cannon hat.
“Cool!” <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Harry</PER> — ” jammed it onto <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Harry</PER> — ”'s head, where it clashed horribly with <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Harry</PER> — ”'s hair.
“They’re They’re really well, thanks, Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness again.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby’s odd socks — with the obvious exception of the Dursleys’, which consisted of a single tissue, an all-time low — <PER>Harry</PER> supposed they too were remembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland ; <PER>Ron</PER>, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, a vast box of sweets including all <PER>Harry</PER>’s favorites: Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frogs, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> met up with <PER>Hermione</PER> in the common room, and they went down to breakfast together.
<PER>Hermione</PER> chose to watch <PER>Harry</PER> and the Weasleys’ snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o’clock said <PER>Hermione</PER> was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.
“Who ’re you going with?” he yelled after <PER>Hermione</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Seamus, Dean, and <PER>Neville</PER> changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as <PER>Ron</PER>, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on himself's face.
“Shall we go down then, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> could just stay in the common room.
Fred winked at <PER>Harry</PER> as Fred passed <PER>Harry</PER> on the way out of the portrait hole.
Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led her over to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was in front; <PER>Malfoy</PER> was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar, which in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion made <PER>Malfoy</PER> look like a vicar.
Then Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s voice called, “Champions over here, please!” Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and <PER>Harry</PER> said “See you in a minute” to <PER>Ron</PER> and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let the chattering crowd through.
Cedric and <PER>Cho</PER> were close to <PER>Harry</PER> too; <PER>Harry</PER> looked away from Cedric and <PER>Cho</PER> so <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have to talk to Cedric and <PER>Cho</PER><PER>Cho</PER>.
she was also smiling — rather nervously, it was true — but the reduction in the size of shis front teeth was more noticeable than ever; <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t understand how <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t spotted it before.
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, walked right past <PER>Hermione</PER> without looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> concentrated on not tripping over <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
Parvati seemed to be enjoying Parvati; Parvati was beaming around at everybody, steering <PER>Harry</PER> so forcefully that <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> were a show dog Parvati was putting through its paces.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of <PER>Ron</PER> and Padma as <PER>Harry</PER> neared the top table.
<PER>Ron</PER> was watching <PER>Hermione</PER> pass with narrowed eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like <PER>Ron</PER>’s as he watched Krum and <PER>Hermione</PER> draw nearer.
<PER>Harry</PER> took the hint and sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that <PER>Harry</PER> thought it ought to be fined.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked <PER>Harry</PER>'s up uncertainly and looked around — there were no waiters.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, however, looked carefully down at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own menu, then said very clearly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s plate, “Pork chops!” And pork chops appeared.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced up at <PER>Hermione</PER> to see how <PER>Hermione</PER> felt about this new and more complicated method of dining — surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house-elves?
<PER>Hermione</PER> was deep in talk with Viktor Krum and hardly seemed to notice what <PER>Hermione</PER> was eating.
It now occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had never actually heard Krum speak before, but <PER>Harry</PER> was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.
“Veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, I am thinking,” <PER>Harry</PER> was telling <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Percy frowned, but <PER>Harry</PER> could have sworn <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> a very small wink.
“Absolutely right,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly, slapping <PER>Harry</PER>'s own hand down on the table in imitation of Fleur.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> give a small wave, and looking around, saw Madame Maxime return it, Madame Maxime's opals glittering in the candlelight.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now teaching Krum to say <PER>Hermione</PER>'s name properly; he kept calling <PER>Hermione</PER>'s “Hermy-own.” “Her-my-oh-nee,” Her said slowly and clearly.
“We’re supposed to dance!” <PER>Harry</PER> tripped over <PER>Harry</PER>'s dress robes as <PER>Harry</PER> stood up.
The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; <PER>Harry</PER> walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye (<PER>Harry</PER> could see Seamus and Dean waving at <PER>Harry</PER> and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention.
<PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> were dancing nearby — he could see <PER>Ginny</PER> wincing frequently as <PER>Neville</PER> trod on her feet — and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was waltzing with Madame Maxime.
“No, I don’t like it,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied, and <PER>Harry</PER> led her away from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where <PER>Ron</PER> and Padma were sitting.
“How’s it going?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who was now watching <PER>Cho</PER> and Cedric.
“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, fanning <PER>Hermione</PER> with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
“If you don’t know,” said <PER>Ron</PER> scathingly, “I’m not going to tell you.” <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at him, then at <PER>Harry</PER>, who shrugged.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, what — ?” “He’s from Durmstrang!” spat <PER>Ron</PER>.
“For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single thing about <PER>Harry</PER>, not one — ” <PER>Ron</PER> changed tack at the speed of light.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, “I haven’t got a problem with <PER>Hermione</PER> coming with Krum — ” But <PER>Ron</PER> ignored <PER>Harry</PER> too.
“No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, still glaring after <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Fine,” snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati and the Beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> could have sworn <PER>Harry</PER> had zoomed <PER>Harry</PER> there by a Summoning Charm.
The top table was now empty; Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>; Madame Maxime and <PER>Hagrid</PER> were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen.
When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.
Bagman opened his mouth to ask <PER>Harry</PER> something, but Percy diverted <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> had <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured.
“Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!” <PER>Snape</PER> snarled as a girl ran past <PER>Snape</PER>.
“And what are you two doing?” he added, catching sight of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> on the path ahead.
<PER>Harry</PER> hand went nervously to <PER>Harry</PER>'s goatee, and <PER>Harry</PER> began winding it around <PER>Harry</PER>'s finger.
“We’re walking,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Snape</PER> shortly.
“Not against the law, is it?” “Keep walking, then!” <PER>Snape</PER> snarled, and <PER>Snape</PER> brushed past them, <PER>Snape</PER>'s long black cloak billowing out behind <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> continued down the path.
“And since when have he and <PER>Snape</PER> been on first- name terms?” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly.
he and <PER>Snape</PER> had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which he and <PER>Snape</PER> could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hagrid</PER> speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> froze.
<PER>Harry</PER> tapped <PER>Ron</PER> on the shoulder and jerked <PER>Harry</PER>'s head toward them, meaning that them could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to <PER>Harry</PER>), but <PER>Ron</PER>, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.
<PER>Harry</PER> definitely didn’t want to listen to this; <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Hagrid</PER> would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (<PER>Harry</PER> certainly would have) — if it had been possible <PER>Harry</PER> would have put <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn’t really an option.
Instead <PER>Harry</PER> tried to interest <PER>Harry</PER> in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer’s back, but the beetle just wasn’t interesting enough to block out <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s next words.
<PER>Harry</PER> could have told <PER>Hagrid</PER> it was best not to answer; <PER>Harry</PER> stood there in the shadows gritting <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth, hoping against hope <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t — but it was no good.
“C’mon,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, very quietly to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What’s up?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, his expression very serious indeed.
“About <PER>Hagrid</PER> being half-giant?” “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, shrugging.
“So what?” <PER>Harry</PER> knew immediately, from the look <PER>Ron</PER> was giving him, that <PER>Harry</PER> was once again revealing him's ignorance of the wizarding world.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> returned to the Great Hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor.
“So?” <PER>Harry</PER> prompted <PER>Ron</PER>.
“There’s nothing wrong with <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” “I know there isn’t, but blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, shaking his head.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried not to watch <PER>Cho</PER> and Cedric too much; it gave <PER>Harry</PER> a strong desire to kick something.
Many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer, but <PER>Harry</PER> was perfectly happy to be going to bed; as far as <PER>Harry</PER> was concerned, the evening hadn’t been much fun.
Out in the entrance hall, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> saying good night to Krum before <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went back to the Durmstrang ship.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed her, but halfway up the staircase <PER>Harry</PER> heard someone calling him.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Cho</PER> waiting for <PER>Harry</PER> in the entrance hall below.
Was his trying to make <PER>Harry</PER> look like a fool, so <PER>Cho</PER> would like his even more by comparison?
<PER>Harry</PER> had to yell “Fairy lights!” before <PER>Harry</PER> woke them up, and when <PER>Harry</PER> did, them were extremely irritated.
<PER>Harry</PER> climbed into the common room and found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> having a blazing row.
“Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution is, don’t you?” yelled <PER>Hermione</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face was screwed up in anger.
“What’s that?” “Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!” <PER>Ron</PER> mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as <PER>Hermione</PER> turned on her heel and stormed up the girls’ staircase to bed.
<PER>Ron</PER> turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> liked being back on speaking terms with <PER>Ron</PER> too much to speak <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind right now — but <PER>Harry</PER> somehow thought that <PER>Hermione</PER> had gotten the point much better than <PER>Ron</PER> had.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s hair was bushy again; <PER>Hermione</PER> confessed to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Hermione</PER> had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for the ball, “but it’s way too much bother to do every day,” she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> wasted no time in telling <PER>Hermione</PER> about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t seem to find the news that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was a half- giant nearly as shocking as <PER>Ron</PER> did.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that <PER>Harry</PER> was keen not to take <PER>Harry</PER>'s help if <PER>Harry</PER> could avoid it.
In any case, it seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> that if Cedric had really wanted to give <PER>Harry</PER> a hand, <PER>Harry</PER> would have been a lot more explicit.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task — and Cedric’s idea of a fair exchange had been to tell <PER>Harry</PER> to take a bath.
Well, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need that sort of rubbishy help — not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with <PER>Cho</PER>, anyway.
And so the first day of the new term arrived, and <PER>Harry</PER> set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were carrying that around with <PER>Harry</PER> too.
Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures much in this weather, though as <PER>Ron</PER> said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin would catch fire.
“I am your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher.” “Where’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned; <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed her, looking back over their shoulders at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
“What’s wrong with <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, hurrying to catch up with Professor Grubbly-Plank.
The moment Professor Grubbly- Plank was out of earshot, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand inside the pocket of <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s robes and pulled out a folded page of newsprint.
Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, Special Correspondent.
Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
While <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turns a blind eye, <PER>Hagrid</PER> has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being “very frightening.” “I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,” says <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, a fourth-year student.
“We all hate <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but we’re just too scared to say anything.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however.
In a bizarre twist, <PER>Hagrid</PER> is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know- Who’s fall from power — thereby driving <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s own mother, like the rest of You-Know- Who’s supporters, into hiding.
Perhaps <PER>Harry</PER> Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's large friend — but Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> surely has a duty to ensure that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, along with Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants.
<PER>Harry</PER> finished reading and looked up at <PER>Ron</PER>, whose mouth was hanging open.
“What d’you mean, “we all hate <PER>Hagrid</PER>’?” <PER>Harry</PER> spat at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands as <PER>Harry</PER> turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.
<PER>Harry</PER> supposed that <PER>Harry</PER> ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but her seemed to have had a good time all the same.
“I didn’t know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni — ” “Look at this!” <PER>Harry</PER> snarled, and <PER>Harry</PER> shoved the Daily Prophet article under <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s nose.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s mouth fell open as <PER>Hermione</PER> read.
<PER>Hermione</PER> reaction was exactly the same as <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
“Anyway, she’s not supposed to come into school anymore, <PER>Hagrid</PER> said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> banned she.
“Sort of thing she’d do, isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.” “Like you and <PER>Ron</PER> did, you mean,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do want <PER>Hagrid</PER> back, of course I do!” <PER>Hermione</PER> added hastily, quailing under <PER>Harry</PER>’s furious stare.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, it’s us!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, pounding on the door.
“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to <PER>Harry</PER> whenever there was a teacher around, so that <PER>Harry</PER> was safe from <PER>Harry</PER>’s retaliation.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was very surprised that <PER>Harry</PER> was going to go.
“Well done!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but <PER>Harry</PER> ignored them.
<PER>Harry</PER> still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages whereas if <PER>Harry</PER> went into Hogsmeade, <PER>Harry</PER> might run into <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and get a chance to persuade <PER>Harry</PER> to come back.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the castle together on Saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates.
He hadn’t mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but <PER>Harry</PER> had found a miniature arm under <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes skinned for a sign of <PER>Hagrid</PER> all the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was not in any of the shops.
The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Hagrid</PER> wasn’t there.
Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, ordered three butter-beers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all.
<PER>Harry</PER> was looking strained again, quite as strained as <PER>Harry</PER> had that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared.
“In a moment, in a moment!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard him say brusquely to the goblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub toward <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s boyish grin back in place.
“You couldn’t give us a moment, you two, could you?” “Er — okay,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and he and <PER>Hermione</PER> went off to find a table.
“Really superb.” “Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew this couldn’t be all that Bagman wanted to say, because <PER>Harry</PER> could have congratulated <PER>Harry</PER> in front of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.
“Absolute nightmare,” said Bagman to <PER>Harry</PER> in an undertone, noticing <PER>Harry</PER> watching the goblins too.
“Listen, <PER>Harry</PER>,” he said (still in a very low voice), “I feel very bad about all this you were thrown into this tournament, you didn’t volunteer for it and if ” (his voice was so quiet now, <PER>Harry</PER> had to lean closer to listen) “if I can help at all a prod in the right direction I’ve taken a liking to you the way you got past that dragon!
“Well well, yes,” said Bagman impatiently, “but — come on, <PER>Harry</PER> — we all want a Hogwarts victory, don’t we?” “Have you offered Cedric help?” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“Can we buy you a drink?” “Er no,” said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at <PER>Harry</PER>, “no, thank you, boys ” Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER> had let <PER>Harry</PER> down badly.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to rejoin <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What did he want?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had sat down.
“Well, I don’t think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would like it if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, still looking deeply disapproving.
“Those goblins didn’t look very friendly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sipping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s butterbeer.
“Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it Crouch’ll be made head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation.” <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Ron</PER> a don’t -joke-about-things-like- that look, and said, “Funny, goblins looking for Mister Crouch .
“Maybe they need an interpreter.” “Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was wearing banana-yellow robes today; <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's long nails were painted shocking pink, and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was accompanied by <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's paunchy photographer.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter bought drinks, and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> glaring at Shis as She approached.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter ’s eyes widened behind <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken.
“What did you do that to <PER>Hagrid</PER> for, eh?” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter raised ” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's heavily penciled eyebrows.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s smile flickered very slightly, but <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s hitched it back almost at once; <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s's Quick-Quotes Quill, and said, “How about giving me an interview about the <PER>Hagrid</PER> you know, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Let’s go,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “c’mon, <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Ron</PER> ” They left; many people were staring at They as many people went.
“She’ll be after you next, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street.
“I’m serious, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll dig up something on you — ” “My parents don’t read the Daily Prophet <PER>Hermione</PER> can’t scare me into hiding!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now striding along so fast that it was all <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> could do to keep up with <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The last time <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rage like this, she had hit <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> around the face.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> shouted, pounding on his front door.
<PER>Hermione</PER> said, “About t — !” and then stopped, very suddenly, because <PER>Hermione</PER> had found <PER>Hermione</PER> face-to-face, not with <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but with Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“We — er — we wanted to see <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rather small voice.
She, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon <PER>Harry</PER> the moment himself entered, barking madly and trying to lick himself's ears.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was sitting at <PER>Harry</PER>'s table, where there were two large mugs of tea.
“Hi, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“More tea, I think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, closing the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes.
There was a slight pause, and then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> went slightly pink, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and continued, “<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> still seem to want to know you, judging by the way “<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> were attempting to break down the door.” “Of course we still want to know you!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, staring at <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea what you said, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.
“I just meant — <PER>Hagrid</PER>, how could you think we’d care what that — woman — wrote about you?” Two fat tears leaked out of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard.
“Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still looking carefully up at the ceiling.
“Not all of ’em wan’ me ter stay.” “Really, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now peering sternly over his half-moon spectacles.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, look what I’ve got for relatives!” <PER>Harry</PER> said furiously.
<PER>Hermione</PER> kept patting his arm, and at last, <PER>Hagrid</PER> looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, “Great man, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> great man ” “Yeah, he is,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Can I have one of these cakes, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “Help yerself,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back to the castle later that afternoon with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, unable to banish the image of the happy expression on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s whiskery face as he had imagined <PER>Harry</PER> winning the tournament.
As <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea how long a bath <PER>Harry</PER> would need to work out the secret of the golden egg, <PER>Harry</PER> decided to do it at night, when <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to take as much time as <PER>Harry</PER> wanted.
Reluctant though <PER>Harry</PER> was to accept more favours from Cedric, <PER>Harry</PER> also decided to use the prefects’ bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in there, so it was much less likely that <PER>Harry</PER> would be disturbed.
<PER>Harry</PER> planned <PER>Harry</PER>'s excursion carefully, because <PER>Harry</PER> had been caught out of bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before, and had no desire to repeat the experience.
The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the cloak, was the most useful aid to rule-breaking <PER>Harry</PER> owned.
On Thursday night, <PER>Harry</PER> sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as <PER>Harry</PER> had done on the night when <PER>Hagrid</PER> had shown <PER>Harry</PER> the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open.
“Good luck,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered, climbing into the room as <PER>Harry</PER> crept out past <PER>Harry</PER>.
It was awkward moving under the cloak tonight, because <PER>Harry</PER> had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose with the other.
However, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the map at strategic intervals, <PER>Harry</PER> was able to ensure that <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t run into anyone <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to avoid.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with <PER>Harry</PER>'s gloves on the wrong hands, <PER>Harry</PER> located the right door, leaned close to the right door, and muttered the password, “Pine fresh,” just as Cedric had told <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped inside, bolted the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved forward, looking around, <PER>Harry</PER>'s footsteps echoing off the walls.
One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that <PER>Harry</PER> thought it would have supported <PER>Harry</PER>'s weight if <PER>Harry</PER>’d cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water.
<PER>Harry</PER> amused <PER>Harry</PER> for a while turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs.
Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a very short time considering its size, <PER>Harry</PER> turned off all the taps, pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water.
It was so deep that <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet barely touched the bottom, and <PER>Harry</PER> actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring at the egg.
Highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different- colored steam wafting all around <PER>Harry</PER>, no stroke of brilliance came to <PER>Harry</PER>, no sudden burst of understanding.
<PER>Harry</PER> stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms, lifted the egg in <PER>Harry</PER>'s wet hands, and opened his ['s].
“Myrtle!” <PER>Harry</PER> said in outrage, “I’m — I’m not wearing anything!” The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but <PER>Harry</PER> had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on <PER>Harry</PER> from out of one of the taps ever since <PER>Harry</PER> had arrived.
“You haven’t been to see me for ages.” “Yeah well ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, bending <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn’t see anything but <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, “I’m not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I?
“You used to be in there all the time.” This was true, though only because <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had found Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret — a forbidden potion that had turned him and <PER>Ron</PER> into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room.
“You keep your eyes shut!” <PER>Harry</PER> made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting <PER>Harry</PER> out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around <PER>Harry</PER>'s waist, and going to retrieve the egg.
Once <PER>Harry</PER> was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her fingers and said, “Go on, then open it under the water!” <PER>Harry</PER> lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened the egg and this time, it did not wail.
“Go on!” <PER>Harry</PER> took a great breath and slid under the surface — and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to <PER>Harry</PER> from the open egg in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands: “Come seek us where our voices sound, We cannot sing above the ground, And while you’re searching ponder this: We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss, An hour long you’ll have to look, And to recover what We took, But past an hour — the prospect’s black, Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.” <PER>Harry</PER> let <PER>Harry</PER> float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
It took three more underwater renditions of the egg’s song before <PER>Harry</PER> had it memorized; then <PER>Harry</PER> trod water for a while, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dudley</PER> had had lessons in his youth, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that <PER>Harry</PER> would drown one day, hadn’t bothered to give <PER>Harry</PER> any.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none of the other ghosts <PER>Harry</PER> knew made such a fuss about it.
“Er I’ll try,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, though privately thinking the only way <PER>Harry</PER>’d be visiting Myrtle’s bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked.
<PER>Harry</PER> had taken <PER>Harry</PER>'s first step back toward Gryffindor Tower when something else on the map caught <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye something distinctly odd.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, thinking and then <PER>Harry</PER>'s curiosity got the better of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas.
<PER>Harry</PER> crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take <PER>Harry</PER> down two floors.
And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mister Crouch, <PER>Harry</PER>’s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step <PER>Neville</PER> always forgot to jump.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late; the golden egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step — the Invisibility Cloak slipped <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> snatched at it, and the Marauder’s Map fluttered out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s knee, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t reach it.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was too far away to reach — Pulling the cloak back over <PER>Harry</PER> straightened up, listening hard with <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes screwed up with fear and, almost immediately — It was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wheezy voice raised in fury.
“You’ve been stealing!” He ripped back the tapestry below, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s horrible, pouchy face and bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase.
At the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make <PER>Harry</PER>’s situation worse: <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was wearing a long gray nightshirt and <PER>Harry</PER> looked livid.
<PER>Harry</PER> gritted <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth, convinced <PER>Harry</PER>'s loudly thumping heart would give <PER>Harry</PER> away at any second.
“I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break!” <PER>Snape</PER> looked up the stairs, straight through <PER>Harry</PER>, and then down into the corridor below.
Go, <PER>Harry</PER> pleaded with <PER>Harry</PER> silently, go with <PER>Snape</PER> go Mistress Norris was peering around Filch ’s legs.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct impression that Mistress Norris could smell <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual — and then Professor <PER>Snape</PER> discovered that someone had broken into Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s off — ” “Shut up!” Professor <PER>Snape</PER> hissed to Filch.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Moody’s magical eye travel over <PER>Snape</PER>, and then, unmistakably, onto <PER>Harry</PER>.
Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks Moody alone could see the full strangeness of the scene: <PER>Snape</PER> in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, trapped in the stairs behind them.
“Did I hear that correctly, <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Snape</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> could see a vein flickering horribly on <PER>Snape</PER> ’s greasy temple.
“Not hiding anything else in your office, are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> saw the edge of <PER>Snape</PER> ’s sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein in <PER>Harry</PER>'s temple pulsing more rapidly.
“Get back to bed, <PER>Snape</PER>.” “You don’t have the authority to send me anywhere!” <PER>Snape</PER> hissed, letting go of <PER>Snape</PER>'s arm as though angry with himself.
As <PER>Snape</PER> and Filch both turned to look at it, <PER>Harry</PER> threw caution to the winds; <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms under the cloak and waved furiously at Moody to attract <PER>Harry</PER>'s attention, mouthing “It’s mine!
“It’s mine — must’ve dropped it earlier — ” But <PER>Snape</PER> ’s black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch’s arms to the map in Moody’s hand, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Harry</PER> was putting two and two together, as only <PER>Snape</PER> could.
“Potter!” <PER>Snape</PER> snarled, and <PER>Snape</PER> actually turned <PER>Snape</PER>'s head and stared right at the place where <PER>Harry</PER> was, as though <PER>Harry</PER> could suddenly see <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was looking down at Moody, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see the expression on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
Then <PER>Snape</PER> slowly lowered <PER>Snape</PER>'s hands.
Still breathing very fast, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Snape</PER> walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mistress Norris.
<PER>Harry</PER> was left staring down at Moody, who placed <PER>Harry</PER>'s staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward <PER>Harry</PER>, a dull clunk on every other step.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, hoping Moody was going to pull <PER>Harry</PER> out of the staircase soon; <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg was really hurting <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Harry</PER> dared ask.
It was a penetrating glare, and <PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that Moody was sizing <PER>Harry</PER> up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered how much <PER>Harry</PER> dare say.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want Moody to guess that <PER>Harry</PER> had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky questions about Sirius.
Could Moody possibly mean what <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> meant?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart sank; <PER>Harry</PER>’s had thought this was coming.
Moody waved the map in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, who braced himself — “Can I borrow this?” “Oh!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very fond of <PER>Harry</PER>'s map, but on the other hand, <PER>Harry</PER> was extremely relieved that Moody wasn’t asking where He’d got it, and there was no doubt that Moody was owed Moody a favor.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about <PER>Snape</PER>, and Crouch, and what it all meant.
Interesting idea but somehow, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as <PER>Harry</PER> got quietly into <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster ten minutes later, the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, his thought his’d like to check how scarred the rest of them were before his chose it as a career.
“I just need to — sort of fine-tune it, all right?” He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s aim was so poor that <PER>Neville</PER>’s kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room — Professor Flitwick, for instance.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been recounting <PER>Harry</PER>'s adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.
“<PER>Snape</PER> said Moody’s searched <PER>Snape</PER>'s office as well?” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered, his eyes alight with interest as his Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it soared into the air and knocked Parvati’s hat off).
“What d’you reckon Moody’s here to keep an eye on <PER>Snape</PER> as well as Karkaroff?” “Well, I dunno if that’s what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to do, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s definitely doing it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, waving <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk.
“Moody said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> only lets <PER>Snape</PER> stay here because <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s giving him a second chance or something.
“<PER>Harry</PER> maybe Moody thinks <PER>Snape</PER> put your name in the Goblet of Fire!” “Oh <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shaking her head sceptically, “we thought <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to kill <PER>Harry</PER> before, and it turned out <PER>Harry</PER> was saving <PER>Harry</PER>’s life, remember?” She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, thinking it was true that <PER>Snape</PER> had saved <PER>Harry</PER>'s life once, but the odd thing was, <PER>Snape</PER> definitely loathed <PER>Harry</PER>, just as he’d loathed <PER>Harry</PER>’s father when they had been at school together.
<PER>Snape</PER> loved taking points from <PER>Harry</PER>, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give <PER>Snape</PER> punishments, or even to suggest that <PER>Snape</PER> should be suspended from the school.
“Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>, why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office, then?” “Why has Mister Crouch been pretending to be ill?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You just want to think <PER>Snape</PER>’s up to something,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sending <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cushion zooming neatly into the box.
“I just want to know what <PER>Snape</PER> did with his first chance, if his’s on his second one,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grimly, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s cushion, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s very great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.
Obedient to Sirius’s wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER> sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mister Crouch breaking into <PER>Snape</PER>’s office, and Moody and <PER>Snape</PER>’s conversation.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing <PER>Harry</PER>: how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty- fourth of February.
<PER>Ron</PER> quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again — <PER>Harry</PER> had explained about Aqua- Lungs, and <PER>Ron</PER> couldn’t see why <PER>Harry</PER> shouldn’t Summon one from the nearest Muggle town.
<PER>Hermione</PER> squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that <PER>Harry</PER> managed to learn how to operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua- Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.
“No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm.” So <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking that So <PER>Harry</PER> would soon have had enough of the library to last <PER>Harry</PER> a lifetime, buried <PER>Harry</PER> once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen.
However, though he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends — though <PER>Harry</PER> asked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help — they found nothing whatsoever that would enable <PER>Harry</PER> to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.
Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb <PER>Harry</PER> now, and <PER>Harry</PER> was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again.
The lake, which <PER>Harry</PER> had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes whenever <PER>Harry</PER> was near a classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the parchment, unrolled the parchment, and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Weekend after next,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had read the note over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“Come on Care of Magical Creatures.” Whether <PER>Hagrid</PER> was trying to make up for the Blast- Ended Skrewts, or because there were now only two skrewts left, or because Whether <PER>Hagrid</PER> <PER>Hagrid</PER> was trying to prove Whether <PER>Hagrid</PER> could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank could, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he’d returned to work.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees buckled under its weight, “I’d’ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on tha’ Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin’ yeh set yer mind ter.
yeh looked after everything else on the grounds, after all — “Yeh’re goin’ ter win,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> growled, patting <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder again, so that <PER>Harry</PER> actually felt <PER>Harry</PER> sink a couple of inches into the soft ground.
By the evening before the second task, <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> were trapped in a nightmare.
<PER>Harry</PER> was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, <PER>Harry</PER> managed to find a suitable spell, He’d have a real job mastering it overnight.
Why had <PER>Harry</PER> ever let <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater?
a teacher sat with <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the library as the sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart gave a huge leap every time <PER>Harry</PER> saw the word “water” on a page, but more often than not it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt ” “I don’t reckon it can be done,” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice flatly from the other side of the table.
“Be a talking point, wouldn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up.
“<PER>McGonagall</PER> wants you, <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, who felt his stomach drop.
Was Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> about to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> off?
“Well meet you back in the common room,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> as she got up to go with <PER>Ron</PER> — both of them looked very anxious.
People kept wishing <PER>Harry</PER> luck for the next morning in cheery, confident voices like <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, all of People apparently convinced that <PER>Harry</PER> was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one <PER>Harry</PER> had managed in the first task.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t answer them, <PER>Harry</PER> just nodded, feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
he had searched all the remaining books, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had not come back.
He could almost hear Fleur Delacour saying “I knew Fleur Delacour ’e is too young, ’e is only a little boy.” He saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> flashing He's POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the crowd, saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s crestfallen, disbelieving face.
Forgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap, <PER>Harry</PER> stood up very suddenly; Crookshanks hissed angrily as <PER>Harry</PER> landed on the floor, gave <PER>Harry</PER> a disgusted look, and stalked away with <PER>Harry</PER>'s bottlebrush tail in the air, but <PER>Harry</PER> was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory .
<PER>Harry</PER> would grab the Invisibility Cloak and go back to the library, He’d stay there all night if <PER>Harry</PER> had to.
“Lumos,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered fifteen minutes later as <PER>Harry</PER> opened the library door.
<PER>Harry</PER> carried them over to a table, then set to work, searching them by the narrow beam of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, occasionally checking <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch.
<PER>Harry</PER> was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock, while her held <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt over his head.
“That hurts — get off — ouch — ” “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter must wake up, sir!” “Stop poking me — ” “Dobby must poke <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir, he must wake up!” <PER>Harry</PER> opened his eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off <PER>Harry</PER>'s head as he’d slept, and the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was stuck to the pages of Where There’s a Wand, There’s a Way.
“The second task starts in ten minutes, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter “Ten minutes?” <PER>Harry</PER> croaked.
A large, dead weight seemed to fall through <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest into <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
“Hurry, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” squeaked Dobby, plucking at <PER>Harry</PER>’s sleeve.
“Dobby knew <PER>Harry</PER> had not found the right book, so Dobby did the right book for <PER>Harry</PER>!” “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They’ve got They’ve got <PER>Ron</PER>?” “The thing <PER>Harry</PER> Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked Dobby.
“It will make <PER>Harry</PER> Potter breathe underwater, sir!” “Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER> frantically, “listen — are you sure about this?” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to “help” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> had ended up with no bones in <PER>Harry</PER>'s right arm.
“Dobby will be missed — good luck, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir, good luck!” “See you later, Dobby!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, and <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time.
They stared as <PER>Harry</PER> flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as <PER>Harry</PER> leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly grounds.
“Let him catch him's breath!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER>, but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime didn’t look at all pleased to see <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent over, hands on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, gasping for breath; <PER>Harry</PER> had a stitch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s side that felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> had a knife between <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs, but there was no time to get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions, spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> was on the very end of the line, next to Krum, who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand ready.
“All right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” Bagman whispered as he moved <PER>Harry</PER> a few feet farther away from Krum.
Bagman gave <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges’ table; <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at his throat as his had done at the World Cup, said, “Sonorusl” and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands.
Then, quite suddenly, <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth and nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to draw breath, but it made <PER>Harry</PER>'s head spin; <PER>Harry</PER>'s lungs were empty, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck — <PER>Harry</PER> clapped — <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands around — <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat and felt two large slits just below ] throat's ears, flapping in the cold air. ]
<PER>Harry</PER> struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast <PER>Harry</PER>'s flipper-like feet propelled <PER>Harry</PER> through The water, and noticing how clearly <PER>Harry</PER> could see, and how <PER>Harry</PER> no longer seemed to need to blink.
<PER>Harry</PER> had soon swum so far into the lake that <PER>Harry</PER> could no longer see the bottom.
Silence pressed upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears as <PER>Harry</PER> soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape.
<PER>Harry</PER> was staring unblinkingly ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to discern shapes through the gloom and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of <PER>Harry</PER>'s ankle.
<PER>Harry</PER> twisted <PER>Harry</PER>'s body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>’s leg, its pointed fangs bared — <PER>Harry</PER> stuck — <PER>Harry</PER>'s webbed hand quickly inside — <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and fumbled for his wand.
By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes, and were attempting to drag <PER>Harry</PER> down.
A large bubble issued from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on them's green skin.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder at random; every now and then <PER>Harry</PER> felt one of the grindylows snatch at <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot again, and <PER>Harry</PER> kicked out, hard; finally, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while the dazed grindylow fellows shook its fellows's fists at <PER>Harry</PER> and sank back into the weed.
<PER>Harry</PER> slowed down a little, slipped <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, and looked around, listening again.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing harder than ever against <PER>Harry</PER>'s eardrums.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> must be even deeper in the lake now, but nothing was moving but the rippling weed.
“How are you getting on?” <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was having a heart attack.
<PER>Harry</PER> whipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, gazing at <PER>Harry</PER> through her thick, pearly glasses.
“Myrtle!” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to shout — but once again, nothing came out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth but a very large bubble.
They leered at <PER>Harry</PER> as he swam past; one or two of They emerged from They's caves to watch <PER>Harry</PER> better, They's powerful, silver fish tails beating the water, spears clutched in They's hands.
<PER>Harry</PER> sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous; there were gardens of weed around some of them, and <PER>Harry</PER> even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door.
Merpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER>'s webbed hands and gills, talking behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s webbed hands and gills's hands to one another.
<PER>Harry</PER> sped around a corner and a very strange sight met <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Ron</PER> was tied between <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER> Chang.
<PER>Harry</PER> sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower the hostages's spears and charge at <PER>Harry</PER>, but the hostages did nothing.
“Come ON\” <PER>Harry</PER> said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth), and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked the spear back, still shaking his head and laughing.
He turned back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, raised the jagged rock, and began to hack at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bindings too — At once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him.
“Your task is to retrieve your own friend leave the others ” “She’s my friend too!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, gesturing toward <PER>Hermione</PER>, an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips.
“And I don’t want them to die either!” <PER>Cho</PER>’s head was on <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale.
<PER>Harry</PER> struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed harder than ever, holding <PER>Harry</PER> back.
Would he have time to take <PER>Ron</PER> to the surface and come back down for <PER>Hermione</PER> and the others?
There was an enormous bubble around <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, which made <PER>Harry</PER>'s features look oddly wide and stretched.
“Fleur and Krum’re coming now!” Feeling enormously relieved, <PER>Harry</PER> watched Cedric pull a knife out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and cut <PER>Cho</PER> free.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Cho</PER>'s upward and out of sight.
Those holding <PER>Harry</PER> loosened Those holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip, staring behind Those holding <PER>Harry</PER>.
The shark-man swam straight to <PER>Hermione</PER> and began snapping and biting at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s ropes; the trouble was that Krum’s new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure that if Krum wasn’t careful, <PER>Harry</PER> was going to rip <PER>Hermione</PER> in half.
Within seconds, he had done it; he grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> around the waist, and without a backward glance, began to rise rapidly with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s toward the surface.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“You’ve got until three!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted; a great stream of bubbles burst from <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> held up three fingers to make sure they got the message.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized the little girl around the waist, grabbed the neck of <PER>Ron</PER>’s robes, and kicked off from the bottom.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming; <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging <PER>Ron</PER> and the girl.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel pain on the sides of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck again <PER>Harry</PER> was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth yet the darkness was definitely thinning now <PER>Harry</PER> could see daylight above <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked hard with <PER>Harry</PER>'s flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feet water was flooding through <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth into <PER>Harry</PER>'s lungs He was starting to feel dizzy, but He knew light and air were only ten feet above He He had to get there He had to <PER>Harry</PER> kicked He's legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest; He's very brain felt waterlogged, He couldn’t breathe, He needed oxygen, He had to keep going, He could not stop — And then He felt He's head break the surface of the lake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making He's wet face sting; He gulped it down, feeling as though He had never breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled <PER>Ron</PER> and the little girl up with He.
The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be on their feet; <PER>Harry</PER> had the impression they thought that <PER>Ron</PER> and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong both of they had opened their eyes; the little girl looked scared and confused, but <PER>Ron</PER> merely expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, and said, “Wet, this, isn’t it?” Then he spotted Fleur’s sister.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you prat,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “you didn’t take that song thing seriously, did you?
It was all very well for <PER>Ron</PER>; he’d been asleep, <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear- carrying merpeople who’d looked more than capable of murder.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over <PER>Hermione</PER>, Krum, Cedric, and <PER>Cho</PER>, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> from the bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual, came splashing out to meet them.
Percy seized <PER>Ron</PER> and was dragging him back to the bank (“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Bagman were pulling <PER>Harry</PER> upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging Madame Maxime's sister.
Madam Pomfrey seized <PER>Harry</PER> and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> over to <PER>Hermione</PER> and the others, wrapped <PER>Harry</PER> so tightly in a blanket that <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, well done!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have told her about Dobby, but <PER>Harry</PER> had just noticed Karkaroff watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Fleur’s sister had got back safely.
“Yeah, that’s right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that himself had just rescued her from the lake, but <PER>Hermione</PER> brushed away the beetle impatiently and said, “You’re well outside the time limit, though, <PER>Harry</PER> .
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water; clearly, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could speak Mermish.
Finally <PER>Dumbledore</PER> straightened up, turned to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fellow judges, and said, “A conference before we give the marks, I think.” his fellow judges went into a huddle.
Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue <PER>Ron</PER> from Percy’s clutches; Madam Pomfrey led him over to <PER>Harry</PER> and the others, gave him a blanket and some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister.
Fleur bent down, kissed <PER>Harry</PER> twice on each cheek (Fleur felt Fleur's face burn and wouldn’t have been surprised if steam was coming out of Fleur's ears again), then said to <PER>Ron</PER>, “And you too — you ’elped — ” “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking extremely hopeful, “yeah, a bit — ” Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him.
“Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though his returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour.” Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Cho</PER> give Cedric a glowing look.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, caught by surprise, stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.
“There you go, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted over the noise.
Fleur attempted to engage <PER>Hermione</PER> in conversation again, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was too busy cheering <PER>Harry</PER> to listen.
Next time he was in Hogsmeade, <PER>Harry</PER> decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle, <PER>Harry</PER> was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year.
One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that <PER>Ron</PER> was getting to share <PER>Harry</PER>’s limelight for once.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Ron</PER>’s version of events changed subtly with every retelling.
At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with <PER>Hermione</PER>’s story, anyway — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s office, first assuring all the hostages that all the hostages would be quite safe, and would awake when all the hostages were back above the water.
People had been teasing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would most miss that <PER>Hermione</PER> was in a rather tetchy mood.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s ears went red, and thereafter, <PER>Ron</PER>’s reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events.
The brown owl that <PER>Harry</PER> had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; <PER>Harry</PER> had no sooner torn off Sirius’s reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again.
“I can’t believe him,” said <PER>Harry</PER> tensely, “if he’s caught ” “Made it so far, though, hasn’t he?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
If <PER>Harry</PER> was honest with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> really wanted to see Sirius again.
<PER>Harry</PER> therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon — double Potions — feeling considerably more cheerful than <PER>Harry</PER> usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons.
Pansy’s pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle ’s broad back as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> approached.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual.
Once <PER>Snape</PER> had turned <PER>Snape</PER>'s back on them to write up the ingredients of today’s potion on the blackboard, <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned in closer.
A color photograph of <PER>Harry</PER> headed a short piece entitled: <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s Secret Heartache A boy like no other, perhaps — yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter.
Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteen-year-old <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thought fourteen-year-old <PER>Harry</PER> Potter had found solace in fourteen-year-old <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle- born <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
“I told you!” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed at <PER>Hermione</PER> as she stared down at the article.
“If that’s the best <PER>Rita</PER> can do, she’s losing shis touch,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, still giggling, as <PER>Hermione</PER> threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> started unpacking the ingredients they would need for them's Wit-Sharpening Potion.
“There’s something funny, though,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> ten minutes later, holding <PER>Hermione</PER>'s pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles.
“How could <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter have known ?” “Known what?” said <PER>Ron</PER> quickly.
“You haven’t been mixing up Love Potions, have you?” “Don’t be stupid,” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped, starting to pound up <PER>Hermione</PER>'s beetles again.
“No, it’s just how did <PER>Hermione</PER> know Viktor asked me to visit Viktor over the summer?” <PER>Hermione</PER> blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided <PER>Ron</PER>’s eyes.
“And he did say he’d never felt the same way about anyone else,” <PER>Hermione</PER> went on, going so red now that <PER>Harry</PER> could almost feel the heat coming from <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but how could <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter have heard <PER>Harry</PER>?
my class was now looking around at them; <PER>Malfoy</PER> took the opportunity to flash POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“A further ten points from Gryffindor oh but of course ” <PER>Snape</PER>’s black eyes glittered as they fell on <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s article.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s fury, <PER>Harry</PER> began to read the article aloud.
“ ‘ <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.’ How very touching,” sneered <PER>Snape</PER>, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins.
<PER>Snape</PER> followed, sat down at <PER>Snape</PER>'s desk and watched <PER>Harry</PER> unload his cauldron.
Determined not to look at <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> resumed the mashing of <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarab beetles, imagining each one to have <PER>Snape</PER>’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to provoke <PER>Snape</PER>; <PER>Snape</PER> had done this before.
“You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,” <PER>Snape</PER> went on, so quietly that no one else could hear <PER>Snape</PER> (<PER>Harry</PER> continued to pound <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarab beetles, even though <PER>Harry</PER> had already reduced them to a very fine powder), “but I don’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers.
His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but His kept His's eyes down, as though His couldn’t hear what <PER>Snape</PER> was saying to <PER>Snape</PER>.
“So I give you fair warning, Potter,” <PER>Snape</PER> continued in a softer and more dangerous voice, “pint-sized celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my office one more time — ” “I haven’t been anywhere near your office!” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, forgetting <PER>Harry</PER>'s feigned deafness.
“Don’t lie to me,” <PER>Snape</PER> hissed, <PER>Snape</PER>'s fathomless black eyes boring into <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year — they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion — and while <PER>Snape</PER> had suspected <PER>Harry</PER> at the time, <PER>Harry</PER> had never been able to prove it.
<PER>Snape</PER> plunged a hand into the inside of <PER>Snape</PER>'s black robes.
For one wild moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Snape</PER> was about to pull out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and curse <PER>Snape</PER> — then <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Snape</PER> had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion.
“Do you know what this is, Potter?” <PER>Snape</PER> said, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes glittering dangerously again.
He didn’t like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would He put it past <PER>Snape</PER> to slip <PER>Snape</PER> some.
He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of He's mouth if <PER>Snape</PER> did it quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble — <PER>Hermione</PER> and Dobby for a start — there were all the other things he was concealing like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius and — his insides squirmed at the thought — how he felt about <PER>Cho</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was twisting <PER>Snape</PER>'s finger around <PER>Snape</PER>'s goatee and looking agitated.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>'s ginger roots, listening hard.
“I’ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,” <PER>Snape</PER> muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted <PER>Snape</PER>.
Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, <PER>Harry</PER> deliberately knocked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave <PER>Harry</PER> an excuse to duck down behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door.
“This,” said Karkaroff, and <PER>Harry</PER>, peering around the edge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left- hand sleeve of his robe and show <PER>Snape</PER> something on <PER>Snape</PER>'s inner forearm.
Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER>'s books and ingredients back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and left at top speed to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> what he had just witnessed.
“Hello, Sirius,” said <PER>Harry</PER> when they had reached <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed over the stile and followed.
It was easy for him, with him's four paws, but <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were soon out of breath.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself.
For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony path, following Sirius’s wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bag cutting into <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled open <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread.
<PER>Ron</PER> nudged <PER>Harry</PER> and passed him the Daily Prophets.
“I bet he wishes he hadn’t done it now — bet he feels the difference now she’s not there to look after he.” “<PER>Hermione</PER>’s obsessed with house-elfs,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to Sirius, casting <PER>Hermione</PER> a dark look.
“Crouch sacked his house-elf?” “Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> launched into the story of the Dark Mark’s appearance, and Winky being found with <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand clutched in her hand, and Mister Crouch’s fury.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, Sirius was on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave.
Then he said, “<PER>Harry</PER>, did you check your pockets for your wand after you’d left the Top Box?” “Erm ” <PER>Harry</PER> thought hard.
“Some Bulgarian ministers <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s ” “The <PER>Malfoy</PER>s!” said <PER>Ron</PER> suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously.
“Remember?” she said to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Told you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking meaningfully at Sirius, “told you <PER>Hermione</PER>’s obsessed with house — ” But Sirius held up a hand to silence <PER>Ron</PER>.
“When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, what did Crouch do?” “Went to look in the bushes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but there wasn’t anyone else there.” “Of course,” Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, “of course, he’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf and then he sacked her?” “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a heated voice, “he sacked <PER>Hermione</PER>, just because <PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t stayed in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s tent and let <PER>Hermione</PER> get trampled — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, will you give it a rest with the elf!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
He suddenly looked as menacing as He had the night when <PER>Harry</PER> first met him, the night when <PER>Harry</PER> still believed Sirius to be a murderer.
“He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial.” “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn’t you know?” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> shook their heads.
<PER>Harry</PER> was thinking of the way Crouch’s eyes had bulged as he’d looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s disobedient house-elf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup.
“If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater.” “And he sneaked up here to search <PER>Snape</PER>’s office!” said <PER>Ron</PER> triumphantly, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Look, I don’t care what you say, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts <PER>Snape</PER> — ” “Oh give it a rest, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently.
“I know <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s brilliant and everything, but that doesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn’t fool <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s — ” “Why did <PER>Snape</PER> save <PER>Harry</PER>’s life in the first year, then?
“I think they’ve both got a point,” said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Ever since I found out <PER>Snape</PER> was teaching here, I’ve wondered why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hired <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> knew more curses when <PER>Snape</PER> arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and <PER>Snape</PER> was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.” Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names.
“Yeah, you should’ve seen <PER>Snape</PER>’s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“Karkaroff wanted to talk to <PER>Snape</PER>, Karkaroff says <PER>Snape</PER>’s been avoiding him.
“There’s still the fact that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts <PER>Snape</PER>, and I know <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts where a lot of other people wouldn’t, but I just can’t see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> letting <PER>Snape</PER> teach at Hogwarts if <PER>Snape</PER>’d ever worked for <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” “Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into <PER>Snape</PER> ’s office then?” said <PER>Ron</PER> stubbornly.
“What’s the time?” <PER>Harry</PER> checked <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch, then remembered it hadn’t been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is too good to Dobby!” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter squeaked, wiping large tears out of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's enormous eyes.
“Oh dear,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Hermione</PER> spotted Winky.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is brave and noble and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter is not nosy!” “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is nosing — hie — into my master’s — hie — private and secret — hie — Winky is a good house-elf — hie — Winky keeps her silence — hie — people trying to — hie — pry and poke — hie — ” Winky’s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off shis stool into the hearth, snoring loudly.
They were suddenly looking at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though <PER>Hermione</PER> were mad and dangerous.
“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at <PER>Harry</PER>’s elbow, and <PER>Harry</PER> shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms.
“Good-bye!” The house-elves crowded around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of them's backs.
“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> got so tired of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that <PER>Harry</PER> took Sirius’s food up to the Owlery that evening on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
Looking down, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> digging energetically in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing; it looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> were making a new vegetable patch.
Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> snarling at each other, <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Hagrid</PER> digging until the darkness swallowed <PER>Harry</PER> and the owls around <PER>Harry</PER> began to awake, swooshing past <PER>Harry</PER> into the night.
By breakfast the next day <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bad moods had burnt out, and to <PER>Harry</PER>’s relief, <PER>Ron</PER>’s dark predictions that the house-elves would send substandard food up to the Gryffindor table because <PER>Hermione</PER> had insulted them proved false; the bacon, eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.
When the post owls arrived, <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up eagerly; <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be expecting something.
“Hey, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I think you’re in luck — ” A gray owl was soaring down toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, seizing <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver How many subscriptions's own letter first.
“Ow!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, tears starting in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes as <PER>Hermione</PER> tried to rub the pus off <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands with a napkin, but <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though <PER>Hermione</PER> were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves.
“You’d better get up to the hospital wing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as the owls around <PER>Hermione</PER> took flight.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s was particularly efficient; it had soon filled <PER>Ron</PER>’s's lap with coins.
“Can you buy these as pets, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>?
“Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, grinning.
It turned out that <PER>Ron</PER>’s niffler had been most successful, so <PER>Hagrid</PER> gave him an enormous slab of Honeydukes chocolate for a prize.
The bell rang across the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set off back to the castle, but <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stayed behind to help <PER>Hagrid</PER> put the nifflers back in their boxes.
“What yeh done ter your hands, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking concerned.
<PER>Hermione</PER> told him about the hate mail <PER>Hermione</PER> had received that morning, and the envelope full of bubotuber pus.
“They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they, <PER>Ron</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER>, however, was frowning at the chocolate <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given him.
Then his said, “I hate being poor.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other.
Then, when <PER>Ron</PER> continued to look gloomy, she said, “Come on, <PER>Ron</PER>, it could be worse.
“I’ll get her back for this if it’s the last thing I do!” Hate mail continued to arrive for <PER>Hermione</PER> over the following week, and although <PER>Hermione</PER> followed <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill- wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole Hall to hear.
Even those people who didn’t read Witch Weekly knew all about the supposed <PER>Harry</PER>- Krum-<PER>Hermione</PER> triangle now.
<PER>Harry</PER> was getting sick of telling people that <PER>Hermione</PER> wasn’t <PER>Harry</PER>'s girlfriend.
<PER>Harry</PER> had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, <PER>Harry</PER> had to hold <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands clamped over them as <PER>Harry</PER> walked away from the class.
“Well, <PER>Rita</PER>’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!” <PER>Hermione</PER> panted five minutes later, catching up with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the entrance hall and pulling <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand away from one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wiggling ears so that <PER>Harry</PER> could hear her.
“Moody says Moody didn’t see Moody's anywhere near the judges’ table at the second task, or anywhere near the lake!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, is there any point in telling you to drop this?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> was fascinated, but <PER>Hermione</PER> interrupted them.
“Do we have to start a vendetta against <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter as well?” “I’m not asking you to help!” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped.
<PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure <PER>Hermione</PER> was going to the library.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, did not ask <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to help <PER>Hermione</PER>'s pursue vengeance against <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the Easter holidays.
<PER>Harry</PER> frankly marveled at the fact that <PER>Hermione</PER> could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> was working flat-out just to get through all their homework, though <PER>Harry</PER> made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for Sirius; after last summer, <PER>Harry</PER> had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry.
<PER>Harry</PER> enclosed notes to Sirius, telling <PER>Harry</PER> that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and that they were still waiting for an answer from Percy.
Both <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee.
“Gets it for the recipes.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked sadly at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s tiny egg.
Finally, in the last week of May, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> held Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> back in Transfiguration.
“Mister Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task.” So at half past eight that night, <PER>Harry</PER> left <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs.
“Fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels; Fleur reckons we’ve got to find treasure.” “That wouldn’t be too bad,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking that <PER>Harry</PER> would simply ask <PER>Hagrid</PER> for a niffler to do the job for him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and Cedric made <PER>Harry</PER> and Cedric's way toward <PER>Harry</PER> and Cedric, climbing over the hedges.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to help <PER>Harry</PER> again, but just then, Krum tapped <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder.
“I’ll wait for you, <PER>Harry</PER>, shall I?” “No, it’s okay, Mister Bagman,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, suppressing a smile, “I think I can find the castle on my own, thanks.” <PER>Harry</PER> and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum did not set a course for the Durmstrang ship.
“What ’re we going this way for?” said <PER>Harry</PER> as they passed <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin and the illuminated Beauxbatons carriage.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because We’re friends.” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t quite believe <PER>Harry</PER> was having this conversation with Viktor Krum, the famous International Quidditch player.
It was as though the eighteen-year-old Krum thought he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was an equal — a real rival — “You haff never you haff not ” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> very firmly.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t recognize <PER>Harry</PER> then <PER>Harry</PER> realized it was Mister Crouch.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> had been traveling for days.
The knees of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes were ripped and bloody, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face scratched; <PER>Harry</PER> was unshaven and gray with exhaustion.
“Isn’t he vith your Ministry?” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward Mister Crouch, who did not look at <PER>Harry</PER>, but continued to talk to a nearby tree. "
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at Krum, who had followed <PER>Harry</PER> into the trees, and was looking down at Crouch in alarm.
He reached out and seized a handful of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes, dragging <PER>Harry</PER> closer, though <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes were staring over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
“Must tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ” “Get up, Mister Crouch,” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly and clearly.
“Get up, I’ll take you to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” Mister Crouch’s eyes rolled forward onto <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s?” “That’s right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Crouch was pulling Crouch closer; <PER>Harry</PER> tried to loosen Crouch’s grip on <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, but it was too powerful.
“Warn <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ” “I’ll get Warn <PER>Dumbledore</PER> if you let go of me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’ll get <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I’ll be quicker, I know where <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s office is <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is mad,” said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch, who was still gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was Percy.
“Just stay with him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, starting to get up, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mister Crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> back to the ground.
“I escaped must warn must tell see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> my fault all my fault Bertha dead all my fault my son my fault tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> Potter <PER>Voldemort</PER> stronger <PER>Harry</PER> Potter ” “I’ll get <PER>Dumbledore</PER> if you let me go, Mister Crouch!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Just keep him here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> free of Mister Crouch.
“I’ll be back with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Hurry, von’t you?” Krum called after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted away from the forest and up through the dark grounds.
“C’mon!” But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because <PER>Harry</PER> shouted at it; <PER>Harry</PER> knew it was no good.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> started running as fast as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could toward the staircase — <PER>Harry</PER> skidded to a halt and looked around.
The wall was sliding shut behind <PER>Snape</PER> even as <PER>Snape</PER> beckoned <PER>Harry</PER> back toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What are you doing here, Potter?” “I need to see Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of <PER>Snape</PER> instead.
“I’ve got to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
“Didn’t you hear me, Potter?” <PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Snape</PER> was thoroughly enjoying <PER>Harry</PER>, denying <PER>Harry</PER> the thing <PER>Harry</PER> wanted when <PER>Harry</PER> was so panicky.
“Look,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, “Crouch isn’t right — he’s — he’s out of his mind — he says he wants to warn — The stone wall behind <PER>Snape</PER> slid open.
“Professor!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, sidestepping <PER>Snape</PER> before <PER>Snape</PER> could speak, “Crouch is here — “Mister Crouch’s down in the forest, “Crouch wants to speak to you!” <PER>Harry</PER> expected <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to ask questions, but to <PER>Harry</PER>'s relief, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did nothing of the sort.
“Lead the way,” he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor behind <PER>Harry</PER>, leaving <PER>Snape</PER> standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly.
“What did Mister Crouch say, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase.
“Said Said wants to warn you said Said’s done something terrible Said mentioned his son and Bertha Jorkins and — and <PER>Voldemort</PER> something about <PER>Voldemort</PER> getting stronger.
“He’s not acting normally,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, hurrying along beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Over here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, moving in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, leading the way through the trees.
“They were here,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hurried forward.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> bent over Krum and gently lifted one of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyelids.
“Stay here.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin.
Then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> bent over Krum again, pointed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and muttered, “Renneruate.” Krum opened his eyes.
When his saw <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his tried to sit up, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> put a hand on his shoulder and made his lie still.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — what the — ?” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Karkaroff, please, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply.
Neither <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> spoke again until they heard the unmistakable sounds of <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Fang returning.
“What is this?” he cried when he saw Krum on the ground and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> beside him.
“Apologize!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s massive fist at his throat, his feet dangling in midair.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, no\” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shouted, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes flashing.
“Kindly escort <PER>Harry</PER> back up to the castle, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply.
How had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> known that, at that very moment, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to Sirius, to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what had happened?
“He wasn’t trying to jinx me, He just wanted to talk about <PER>Hermione</PER> — ” “I’ll be havin’ a few words with her, an’ all,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> grimly, stomping up the stairs.
He clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were sitting, to tell them what had happened.
“It comes down to this,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, rubbing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s forehead.
“That’s why Viktor was gone when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got there.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had crept out of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius.
“Just go through it again, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“If <PER>Snape</PER> hadn’t held me up,” <PER>Harry</PER> said bitterly, “we might’ve got there in time.
“Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn’t — ” “Shh!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly.
Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand so that the name on it was covered.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw George half glance at Fred, before smiling at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at one another.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’d probably blast us through the door if us wake <PER>Harry</PER> at the crack of dawn; <PER>Harry</PER>’ll think we’re trying to attack <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER>’s asleep.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept checking <PER>Ron</PER>’s watch, having finally discarded <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, but <PER>Ron</PER>’s was moving so slowly <PER>Ron</PER>’s could have sworn it had stopped working too.
All three of them were so tired them could happily have put them's heads down on the desks and slept; even <PER>Hermione</PER> wasn’t taking even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s usual notes, but was sitting with even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head on even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand, gazing at Professor Binns with even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes out of focus.
“You can’t Disapparate on the grounds, <PER>Ron</PER>\” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Should be right up your street, this one,” said Moody, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER> and scratching <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarred and stubbly chin.
“You two,” counseled Moody, his normal eye on <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, “you stick close to Potter, all right?
It fluttered down beside <PER>Harry</PER> at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of <PER>Hermione</PER>, clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak.
Stay close to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm yourself for the third task.
Sirius “Who’s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?” said <PER>Harry</PER> in mild indignation as <PER>Harry</PER> folded up Sirius’s letter and put it inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice.
<PER>Harry</PER> was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which <PER>Harry</PER> had never used before.
The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s part.
“Can’t we kidnap Mistress Norris?” <PER>Ron</PER> suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been Stunned and reawoken by <PER>Harry</PER> for the fifth time in a row.
“Just try and fall backward!” “Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
“Why don’t you take a turn?” “Well, I think <PER>Harry</PER>’s got it now, anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily.
“See you at dinner!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off for Arithmancy, while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> headed toward North Tower, and Divination.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s head swam as <PER>Harry</PER>’s made <PER>Harry</PER>’s's way over to one of the curtained windows.
The heavily perfumed fumes washed over <PER>Harry</PER>, and the breeze from the window played across <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> had left the owl’s back <PER>Harry</PER> was watching, now, as it fluttered across the room, into a chair with its back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in Wormtail's body were on fire, the screaming filled <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears as the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead seared with pain; <PER>Harry</PER> was yelling too.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> would hear <PER>Voldemort</PER>, would know <PER>Voldemort</PER> was there.
Her great eyes loomed over <PER>Harry</PER>, gazing at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“See you later,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the bottom of shis stepladder, however, <PER>Harry</PER> did not set off for the hospital wing.
Sirius had told <PER>Harry</PER> what to do if <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar hurt <PER>Harry</PER> again, and <PER>Harry</PER> was going to follow <PER>Harry</PER>'s advice: <PER>Harry</PER> was going straight to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
<PER>Harry</PER> marched down the corridors, thinking about what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the dream it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken <PER>Harry</PER> on Privet Drive.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran over the details in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, trying to make sure <PER>Harry</PER> could remember them.
<PER>Harry</PER> had heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> accusing Wormtail of making a blunder but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was going to be fed to it instead.
<PER>Harry</PER> had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office without noticing.
<PER>Harry</PER> blinked, looked around, realized what <PER>Harry</PER> had done, and retraced <PER>Harry</PER>'s steps, stopping in front of it.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know the password.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked The gargoyle, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s big toe.
“<PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog!” <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog!
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I’m afraid I don’t see the connection, don’t see the connection at all!” It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge.
“Either Crouch has finally cracked — more than likely, I’m sure you’ll agree, given Crouch's personal history — lost Crouch's mind, and gone wandering off somewhere — ” “He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, <PER>Cornelius</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office once before; it was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, all of whom's chests rising and falling gently.
<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge was standing beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk, wearing <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge] usual pinstriped cloak and holding his lime-green bowler hat.
Then, feeling it was pointless to pretend that he hadn’t overheard what they had been saying, he added, “I didn’t see Madame Maxime anywhere, though, and Madame Maxime’d have a job hiding, wouldn’t Madame Maxime?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER> behind Fudge’s back, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes twinkling.
“Yes, well,” said Fudge, looking embarrassed, “we’re about to go for a short walk on the grounds, <PER>Harry</PER>, if you’ll excuse we perhaps if you just go back to your class — ” “I wanted to talk to you, Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly, looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who gave him a swift, searching look.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down in a chair in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk.
For several minutes, <PER>Harry</PER> sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in the old headmasters's frames, thinking about what <PER>Harry</PER> had just heard, and running <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers over <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar.
It looked like light made liquid — or like wind made solid — <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t make up — <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent closer, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head right inside the cabinet.
many teachers at Hogwarts seemed, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, to be waiting for something; even though <PER>Harry</PER> could only see the tops of many teachers at Hogwarts's hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to one another.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned even closer, tilting <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, trying to see The tip of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose touched the strange substance into which <PER>Harry</PER> was staring.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office gave an almighty lurch — <PER>Harry</PER> was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin — But — <PER>Harry</PER>'s head did not hit the stone bottom.
head was falling through something icy-cold and black; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool — And suddenly, — <PER>Harry</PER> found — <PER>Harry</PER> sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others.
's 
— <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at the high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which — <PER>Harry</PER> had just been staring, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.
Breathing hard and fast, <PER>Harry</PER> looked around <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to the wizard next to <PER>Harry</PER> on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting right next to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ignored <PER>Harry</PER> completely.
<PER>Harry</PER> gazed, nonplussed, at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, then around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Once before, <PER>Harry</PER> had found <PER>Harry</PER> somewhere that nobody could see or hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
That time, <PER>Harry</PER> had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right into somebody else’s memory and unless <PER>Harry</PER> was very much mistaken, something of the sort had happened again.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not blink, look around at <PER>Harry</PER>, or indeed move at all.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t ignore <PER>Dumbledore</PER> like that.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was inside a memory, and this was not the present-day <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Yet it couldn’t be that long ago <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sitting next to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Dumbledore</PER> now was silver-haired, just like the present-day <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The room, as <PER>Harry</PER> had suspected when observing it from above, was almost certainly underground — more of a dungeon than a room, <PER>Harry</PER> thought.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were, <PER>Harry</PER> heard footsteps.
The man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t blame <PER>Harry</PER> knew the dementors could not touch <PER>Harry</PER> inside a memory, but <PER>Harry</PER> remembered their power only too well.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw Mister Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> heard, quite distinctly, from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s other side, a familiar, growling voice saying, “Filth.” <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward so that <PER>Harry</PER> could see past <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that this news had come as a real blow to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> once more, and saw <PER>Harry</PER> indicating the large chunk out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see that <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to worry that none of <PER>Harry</PER>'s information would be of any use to the Ministry.
“Wait, I have more!” <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> sweating in the torchlight, <PER>Harry</PER>'s white skin contrasting strongly with the black of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair and beard.
“<PER>Snape</PER>!” <PER>Snape</PER>!
“Severus <PER>Snape</PER>!” “Severus <PER>Snape</PER> has been cleared by this council,” said Crouch disdainfully.
““Severus <PER>Snape</PER> has been vouched for by Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “No!” shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that bound “Severus <PER>Snape</PER> to the chair.
Severus <PER>Snape</PER> was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s back.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around; the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke; everything was fading; <PER>Harry</PER> could see only his own body — all else was swirling darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sitting beside <PER>Harry</PER> again, wearing different robes.
“You never spoke a truer word, boy,” someone muttered dryly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were still sitting beside Mister Crouch, but the atmosphere could not have been more different.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up at Crouch and saw that <PER>Harry</PER> looked gaunter and grayer than ever before.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> looked on <PER>Harry</PER>'s other side.
There was an Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sitting on his right, watching Crouch’s son being dragged away by the dementors — and there was an Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on his left, looking right at an Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on his.
“Come,” said the an Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on his on his left, and his put his hand under <PER>Harry</PER>’s elbow.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around <PER>Harry</PER>; for a moment, all was blackness, and then <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> had done a slow-motion somersault, suddenly landing flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, in what seemed like the dazzling light of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s sunlit office.
“Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, “I know I shouldn’t’ve — I didn’t mean — the cabinet door was sort of open and “I quite understand,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> lifted the basin, carried it over to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> motioned for <PER>Harry</PER> to sit down opposite <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Let me show you.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drew <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand out of the inside of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> added this fresh thought to the basin, and <PER>Harry</PER>, astonished, saw <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own face swimming around the surface of the bowl.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> placed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold and <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own face change smoothly into <PER>Snape</PER>’s, who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.
“It’s coming back Karkaroff’s too stronger and clearer than ever ” “A connection I could have made without assistance,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sighed, “but never mind.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> peered over the top of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s half-moon spectacles at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was gaping at <PER>Snape</PER>’s face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head.
her took no notice whatsoever of <PER>Harry</PER> or Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“That was Bertha as I remember her at school.” The silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s face, and it struck <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly how very old <PER>Harry</PER> was looking.
very old <PER>Harry</PER> knew, of course, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was getting on in years, but somehow very old <PER>Harry</PER> never really thought of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as an old man.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
“It woke me up, It hurt so badly.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> merely looked at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I have also been in contact with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ever since <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left Hogwarts last year.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stopped pacing and looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat back down at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk.
“D’you — D’you know why my scar’s hurting me?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked very intently at <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, and then said, “I have a theory, no more than that.
“How indeed Neither <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> spoke for a while.
It was the characteristic, piercing look <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had given <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on other occasions, and always made <PER>Harry</PER> feel as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were seeing right through <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in a way that even Moody’s magical eye could not.
“Once again, <PER>Harry</PER>, I can only give you my suspicions.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sighed again, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked older, and wearier, than ever.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> ought to go, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s curiosity held <PER>Harry</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
“Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Has <PER>Neville</PER> never told you why <PER>Neville</PER> has been brought up by <PER>Neville</PER>'s grandmother?” he said.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, wondering, as <PER>Harry</PER> did so, how <PER>Harry</PER> could have failed to ask <PER>Neville</PER> this, in almost four years of knowing <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes, they were talking about <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“No,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his voice full of a bitterness <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard there before.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head.
“Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly now that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had stopped adding thoughts.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> glanced down into <PER>Snape</PER>’s face, and then up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked into <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s light blue eyes, and the thing <PER>Harry</PER> really wanted to know spilled out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop it.
“What made you think <PER>Harry</PER>’d really stopped supporting <PER>Voldemort</PER>, Professor?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> held <PER>Harry</PER>’s gaze for a few seconds, and then said, “That, <PER>Harry</PER>, is a matter between Professor <PER>Snape</PER> and myself.” <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the interview was over; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not look angry, yet there was a finality in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s tone that told <PER>Harry</PER> it was time to go.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood up, and so did <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” he said as <PER>Harry</PER> reached the door.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing over the Pensieve, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older than ever.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, and then said, “Good luck with the third task.” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> reckons You- Know- Who’s getting stronger again as well?” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered.
Everything <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the Pensieve, nearly everything <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told and shown <PER>Harry</PER> afterward, <PER>Harry</PER> had now shared with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> — and, of course, with Sirius, to whom <PER>Harry</PER> had sent an owl the moment he had left <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind was reeling, until <PER>Harry</PER> understood what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> shiver slightly, even though the evening was warm.
“And he trusts <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> said.
“he really trusts <PER>Snape</PER>, even though he knows he was a Death Eater?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s forehead in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands, staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knees.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Hermione</PER> too looked as though <PER>Hermione</PER> could have done with a Pensieve.
“<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter,” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter muttered finally.
“And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, turning back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but <PER>Harry</PER>’s only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.” “We never thought of her, did We?” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly.
“Look what happened to <PER>Hagrid</PER> when <PER>Rita</PER> found out about his mother.
As <PER>Harry</PER> pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas, <PER>Harry</PER> looked over at <PER>Neville</PER>’s bed.
True to his word to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, he had not told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents.
his often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as his listened to <PER>Neville</PER>’s snores, his thought that <PER>Neville</PER> deserved it more than <PER>Neville</PER> did.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch’s son and <PER>Harry</PER>'s companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors.
It was <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, staring up at the canopy of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed in the darkness, it all came back to <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were supposed to be studying for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s exams, which would finish on the day of the third task, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were putting most of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s efforts into helping <PER>Harry</PER> prepare.
“Don’t worry about it,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said shortly when <PER>Harry</PER> pointed this out to them and said <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t mind practicing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own for a while, “at least we’ll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to find <PER>Harry</PER>'s way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time <PER>Harry</PER> had some notice, some chance to prepare <PER>Harry</PER> for what lay ahead.
Tired of walking in on <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> all over the school, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes.
<PER>Harry</PER> had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable <PER>Harry</PER> to blast solid objects out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling his to check whether his was going in the right direction within the maze.
This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around his that deflected minor curses; <PER>Hermione</PER> managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and <PER>Harry</PER> wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx.
“You’re still doing really well, though,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said encouragingly, looking down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s list and crossing off those spells they had already learned.
“What’s <PER>Malfoy</PER> doing?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> went to see.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was holding <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hand up to <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s mouth and speaking into his mouth.
Like <PER>Hermione</PER>, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting <PER>Harry</PER> through the last task before they concerned they with anything else.
he reminded <PER>Harry</PER> in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of Hogwarts was not <PER>Harry</PER>’s responsibility, nor was it within <PER>Harry</PER>'s power to influence it.
If <PER>Voldemort</PER> is really getting stronger again, <PER>Voldemort</PER> wrote, my priority is to ensure your safety.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s protection, but all the same, take no risks : Concentrate on getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other matters.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together, staring at her.
“Nothing,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but <PER>Ron</PER> grabbed the paper.
“<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter again?” “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and just like <PER>Hermione</PER>, he attempted to push the paper out of sight.
But before <PER>Harry</PER> could demand to see the paper, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table.
“Let me see it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned it over and found <PER>Harry</PER> staring at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own picture, beneath the banner headline: The boy who defeated <PER>Voldemort</PER> is unstable and possibly dangerous, writes <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, Special Correspondent.
“This could be a plea for attention.” The Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts about <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thatAlbus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from the wizarding public.
“Potter can speak Parseltongue, ” reveals <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, a Hogwarts fourth year.
“You tell me how <PER>Hermione</PER> did it!” “I’ve been trying!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ran <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers through <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair again, and then held <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand up to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth, as though speaking into an invisible walkie-talkie.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at each other.
“S’pose so,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>; but just then, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> came walking alongside the Gryffindor table toward Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“But the task’s not till tonight!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down <PER>Harry</PER>'s front, afraid <PER>Harry</PER> had mistaken the time.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as <PER>Harry</PER> crossed to the side chamber and entered.
<PER>Harry</PER> stayed where <PER>Harry</PER> was.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no family — no family who would turn up to see <PER>Harry</PER> risk <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, anyway.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come on, they’re waiting for you!” Utterly perplexed, <PER>Harry</PER> got up.
“You all right?” said Bill, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> and shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“him’s been angry ever since <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s article about the Triwizard Tournament — you know, when <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter made out you were the only Hogwarts champion.” “Didn’t bother to correct <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, though, did he?” said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for <PER>Harry</PER> to hear as <PER>Harry</PER> started to walk out of the door with Molly and Bill.
“Are you going to tell us — ?” <PER>Hermione</PER> shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head warningly and glanced at Molly.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked between them, then said, “Molly, you didn’t believe that rubbish <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you?
As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> rose to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet at the staff table, and silence fell.
It was sort of true; <PER>Harry</PER> was nervous, but <PER>Harry</PER> kept running over all the hexes and spells <PER>Harry</PER> had been practicing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind as they walked, and the knowledge that <PER>Harry</PER> could remember them all made <PER>Harry</PER> feel better.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, Professor Moody, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions.
“Good luck, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> whispered, and the four of them walked away in different directions, to station them around the maze.
“And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!” <PER>Harry</PER> could just make out Molly, Bill, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands.
<PER>Harry</PER> waved up at them, and them waved back, beaming at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt almost as though <PER>Harry</PER> were underwater again.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, muttered, “Lumos,” and heard Cedric do the same just behind Cedric.
“See you,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER> took the left one, while Cedric took the right.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned right, and hurried on, holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand high over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, trying to see as far ahead as possible.
The old feeling that <PER>Harry</PER> was being watched was upon <PER>Harry</PER>.
The path ahead was empty too, and when <PER>Harry</PER> reached a right turn and took it, <PER>Harry</PER> again found <PER>Harry</PER>'s way unblocked.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then, as <PER>Harry</PER> turned a corner, <PER>Harry</PER> saw a dementor gliding toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear its rattling breath; <PER>Harry</PER> felt clammy coldness stealing over <PER>Harry</PER>, but knew what <PER>Harry</PER> had to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> summoned the happiest thought <PER>Harry</PER> could, concentrated with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, raised his wand, and cried, “Expecto Patronum).” A silver stag erupted from the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand and galloped toward the dementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished it could have stayed, <PER>Harry</PER> could have used some company but <PER>Harry</PER> moved on, quickly and quietly as possible, listening hard, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held high once more.
Left right left again Twice <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> facing dead ends.
Twice <PER>Harry</PER> did the Four-Point Spell again and found that Twice <PER>Harry</PER> was going too far east.
Twice <PER>Harry</PER> turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of Twice <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was hanging from the ground, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair on end, <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses dangling off <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless sky.
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched them to the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose and hung there, terrified.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell forward onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees onto the wonderfully solid ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder as <PER>Harry</PER> ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at <PER>Harry</PER> in the moonlight.
<PER>Harry</PER> took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease but at the same time, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help thinking, One champion down The cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though Fleur was no longer in the running.
“Stupefy'.” The spell hit the skrewt’s armor and rebounded; <PER>Harry</PER> ducked just in time, but could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
Panting, <PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER> away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of the skrewt legs at any moment.
Horrified, <PER>Harry</PER> began sprinting up <PER>Harry</PER>'s path, trying to find a way into Cedric’s.
It wasn’t very effective, but It burned a small hole in the hedge through which <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg, kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening; <PER>Harry</PER> struggled through It, tearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, and looking to <PER>Harry</PER>'s right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the ground, Krum standing over Cedric.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> up and pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at Krum just as Krum looked up.
<PER>Harry</PER> dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands over <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around <PER>Harry</PER> and Cedric.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure <PER>Harry</PER> was moving in the right direction.
Every so often <PER>Harry</PER> hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made <PER>Harry</PER> feel sure <PER>Harry</PER> was getting near the heart of the maze.
Then, as <PER>Harry</PER> strode down a long, straight path, <PER>Harry</PER> saw movement once again, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which <PER>Harry</PER> had only seen in picture form, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s Monster Book of Monsters.
<PER>Harry</PER> took that for a “yes.” <PER>Harry</PER> cast <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind around.
“Thanks!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and, amazed at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own brilliance, <PER>Harry</PER> dashed forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to be close now, <PER>Harry</PER> had to be.
<PER>Harry</PER> wand was telling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was bang on course; as long as <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t meet anything too horrible, <PER>Harry</PER> might have a chance.
Cedric was sprinting as fast as Cedric could toward the cup, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> would never catch up, Cedric was much taller, had much longer legs — Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw something immense over a hedge to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left, moving quickly along a path that intersected with <PER>Harry</PER>'s own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen it — “Cedric!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Cedric’s wand fly out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon Cedric.
“Stupefy'.” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled; the spell hit the spider’s gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at <PER>Harry</PER> instead.
<PER>Harry</PER> was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to kick it; <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg connected with the pincers and next moment <PER>Harry</PER> was in excruciating pain.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear Cedric yelling “Stupefy'.” too, but his spell had no more effect than <PER>Harry</PER>’s — <PER>Harry</PER> raised — <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted “ Expelliarmus'.” It worked — the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that <PER>Harry</PER> fell twelve feet onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s already injured leg, which crumpled beneath <PER>Harry</PER>.
Without pausing to think, <PER>Harry</PER> aimed high at the spider’s underbelly, as <PER>Harry</PER> had done with the skrewt, and shouted “Stupefyl” just as Cedric yelled the same thing.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw the longing expression on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face in its golden light.
He felt angry; He's leg was very painful, He was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all He's efforts, Cedric had beaten Cedric to it, just as Cedric’d beaten <PER>Harry</PER> to ask <PER>Cho</PER> to the ball.
“Just take it, then we can get out of here.” Cedric watched <PER>Harry</PER> steadying <PER>Harry</PER>, holding tight to the hedge.
“I would’ve gone down in the first task if you hadn’t told me what was coming.” “I had help on that too,” <PER>Harry</PER> snapped, trying to mop up <PER>Harry</PER>'s bloody leg with <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“We’re still square,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, testing <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg gingerly; it shook violently as <PER>Harry</PER> put weight on it; <PER>Harry</PER> had sprained <PER>Harry</PER>'s ankle when the spider had dropped <PER>Harry</PER>.
For one shining moment, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> emerging from the maze, holding it.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> holding the Triwizard Cup aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw <PER>Cho</PER>’s face shining with admiration, more clearly than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen it before and then the picture faded, and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> staring at Cedric’s shadowy, stubborn face.
“Come here.” he grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm below the shoulder and helped <PER>Harry</PER> limp toward the plinth where the cup stood.
Instantly, <PER>Harry</PER> felt a jerk somewhere behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s navel.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling <PER>Harry</PER> onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet slam into the ground; <PER>Harry</PER>'s injured leg gave way, and <PER>Harry</PER> fell forward; <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last.
Cedric got up, pulled <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, and they looked around.
“Wands out, d’you reckon?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding it arms, <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that it was carrying something.
Whoever it was, <PER>Harry</PER> was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to obscure his face.
<PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric.
It was agony such as <PER>Harry</PER> had never felt in all <PER>Harry</PER>'s life; <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand slipped from <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.
From far away, above his head, his heard a high, cold voice say, “Kill the spare.” A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night: “Avada KedavraV’ A blast of green light blazed through <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyelids, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard something heavy fall to the ground beside <PER>Harry</PER>; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that his retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what his was about to see, his opened his stinging eyes.
Once sure that <PER>Harry</PER> was bound so tightly to the headstone that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak and stuffed it roughly into <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth; then, without a word, <PER>Harry</PER> turned from <PER>Harry</PER> and hurried away.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t make a sound, nor could <PER>Harry</PER> see where Wormtail had gone; <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t turn <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to see beyond the headstone; <PER>Harry</PER> could see only what was right in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched it, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar seared with pain again and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly knew that <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to see what was in those robes <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want that bundle opened.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear noises at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where <PER>Harry</PER> was tied.
Then he came back within <PER>Harry</PER>’s range of vision, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave.
It was full of what seemed to be water — <PER>Harry</PER> could hear it slopping around — and it was larger than any cauldron — <PER>Harry</PER> had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a full-grown man to sit in.
Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them, and <PER>Harry</PER> let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
As he did so, his hood fell back, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail’s weak, pale face in the firelight as <PER>Harry</PER> carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron.
Let it drown, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar burning almost past endurance, please let it drown.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened — <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes as tightly as <PER>Harry</PER> could, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER> had been stabbed with the dagger too.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stand to look but the potion had turned a burning red; the light of the potion shone through <PER>Harry</PER>’s closed eyelids Wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony.
Not until <PER>Harry</PER> felt Wormtail’s anguished breath on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face did <PER>Harry</PER> realize that Wormtail was right in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“B-blood of the enemy forcibly taken you will resurrect your foe.” <PER>Harry</PER> could do nothing to prevent it, <PER>Harry</PER> was tied too tightly.
Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtail’s remaining hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt its point penetrate the crook of <PER>Harry</PER>'s right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of <PER>Harry</PER>'s torn robes.
A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, so that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air It’s gone wrong, <PER>Harry</PER> thought it’s drowned please please let it be dead But then, through the mist in front of him, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, with an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the cauldron.
The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> stared back into the face that had haunted <PER>Harry</PER>'s nightmares for three years.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> looked away from <PER>Harry</PER> and began examining <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own body.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> hands were like large, pale spiders; <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s long white fingers caressed <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own chest, His's arms, His's face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat’s, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> caressed it gently too; and then <PER>Voldemort</PER> raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where <PER>Harry</PER> was tied; <PER>Harry</PER> fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> turned <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scarlet eyes upon <PER>Harry</PER>, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.
“The other arm, Wormtail.” “Master, please please ” <PER>Voldemort</PER> bent down and pulled out Wormtail’s left arm; <PER>Voldemort</PER> forced the sleeve of Wormtail’s robes up past <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s elbow, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo — a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth — the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark.
The scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; <PER>Voldemort</PER> removed <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s fingers from Wormtail’s mark, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that it had turned jet black.
A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, <PER>Voldemort</PER> straightened up, threw back <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s head, and stared around at the dark graveyard.
After a minute or so, He looked down at <PER>Harry</PER> again, a cruel smile twisting <PER>Harry</PER>'s snakelike face.
“You stand, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, upon the remains of my late father,” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter hissed softly.
Then one of the Death Eaters fell to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s knees, crawled toward <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and kissed the hem of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s black robes.
The Death Eaters behind he did the same; each of them approaching <PER>Voldemort</PER> on <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s knees and kissing <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>’s grave, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail.
Let the police come, <PER>Harry</PER> thought desperately anyone anything <PER>Voldemort</PER> raised <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand.
“Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me and Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> rewards Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s helpers.
“Lucius, my slippery friend,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> whispered, halting before <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me — ” “And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> lazily, and Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> stopped talking abruptly.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had reached the largest gap of all, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> stood surveying it with <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s blank, red eyes, as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> could see people standing there.
“You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said softly, ” <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s red eyes upon <PER>Harry</PER>, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony.
The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in The Death Eaters's masks fixed upon <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and upon <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Crucio\” It was pain beyond anything <PER>Harry</PER> had ever experienced; <PER>Harry</PER>'s very bones were on fire; <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was surely splitting along <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar; <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes were rolling madly in his head; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted it to end to black out to die And then it was gone.
<PER>Harry</PER> was hanging limply in the ropes binding <PER>Harry</PER> to the headstone of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist.
Wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging <PER>Harry</PER>, and then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying <PER>Harry</PER> to the gravestone.
There was a split second, perhaps, when <PER>Harry</PER> might have considered running for it, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s injured leg shook under <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled.
Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric’s body lay and returned with <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, which <PER>Harry</PER> thrust roughly into <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand without looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You have been taught how to duel, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> softly, his red eyes glinting through the darkness.
At these words <PER>Harry</PER> remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club at Hogwarts <PER>Harry</PER> had attended briefly two years ago.
All he had learned there was the Disarming Spell, “ Expelliarmus” and what use would it be to deprive <PER>Voldemort</PER> of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand, even if <PER>Voldemort</PER> could, when <PER>Voldemort</PER> was surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one?
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had never learned anything that could possibly fit <PER>Voldemort</PER> for this.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> knew <PER>Voldemort</PER> was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned the un-blockable Avada Kedavra curse — and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was right — his mother was not here to die for his this time.
“We bow to each other, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, bending a little, but keeping <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s snakelike face upturned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not going to let <PER>Voldemort</PER> play with <PER>Harry</PER> before killing <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was not going to give <PER>Harry</PER> that satisfaction.
“I said, bow,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said, raising <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand — and <PER>Harry</PER> felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the Death Eaters laughed harder than ever.
“Very good,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> softly, and as <PER>Voldemort</PER> raised <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand the pressure bearing down upon <PER>Harry</PER> lifted too.
<PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet; <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand had been cut off; <PER>Harry</PER> staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters, and they pushed <PER>Harry</PER> away, back toward <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“A little break,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, the slit-like nostrils dilating with excitement, “a little pause That hurt, didn’t it, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“We are not playing hide-and-seek, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed.
And as he heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s feet he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend he, even if no defense was possible.
Before <PER>Voldemort</PER> could stick <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s snakelike face around the headstone, <PER>Harry</PER> stood up <PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand tightly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, thrust it out in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, and threw <PER>Harry</PER> around the headstone, facing <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
As <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, “ ExpelliarmusV’ <PER>Voldemort</PER> cried, “Avada KedavraV’ A jet of green light issued from <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand just as a jet of red light blasted from <PER>Harry</PER>’s — they met in midair — and suddenly <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized up around it; his couldn’t have released it if his’d wanted to — and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold.
It was coming from every thread of the light- spun web vibrating around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
It was a sound <PER>Harry</PER> recognized, though <PER>Harry</PER> had heard it only once before in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life: phoenix song.
It was the sound of hope to <PER>Harry</PER> the most beautiful and welcome thing <PER>Harry</PER> had ever heard in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the song were inside <PER>Harry</PER> instead of just around <PER>Harry</PER>.
I know, <PER>Harry</PER> told the music, I know I mustn’t but no sooner had <PER>Harry</PER> thought it, than the thing became much harder to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever and now the beam between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> changed too it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands — <PER>Harry</PER> felt — <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand give a shudder under wand's hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily wand's way .
As the closest bead of light moved nearer to <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand tip, the wood beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers grew so hot <PER>Harry</PER> feared it would burst into flame.
The closer that bead moved, the harder <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand vibrated; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand would not survive contact with wand; wand felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers — He concentrated every last particle of He's mind upon forcing the bead back toward <PER>Voldemort</PER>, He's ears full of phoenix song, He's eyes furious, fixed and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way and it was <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s wand that was vibrating extra- hard now <PER>Voldemort</PER> who looked astonished, and almost fearful.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t understand why <PER>Harry</PER> was doing it, didn’t know what it might achieve but <PER>Harry</PER> now concentrated as <PER>Harry</PER> had never done in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life on forcing that bead of light right back into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand and slowly very slowly it moved along the golden thread it trembled for a moment and then it connected.
At once, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain then — <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s red eyes widened with shock — a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail more shouts of pain and then something much larger began to blossom from <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke.
If ever <PER>Harry</PER> might have released <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand from shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept <PER>Harry</PER> clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost?
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s wide red eyes were still shocked <PER>Harry</PER> had no more expected this than <PER>Harry</PER> had and, very dimly, <PER>Harry</PER> heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling around the edges of the golden dome.
More screams of pain from the wand and then something else emerged from the wand tip the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso an old man <PER>Harry</PER> had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done and himself's ghost, or himself's shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric’s, and surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick .
<PER>Harry</PER>, both arms shaking now as <PER>Harry</PER> fought to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring.
“Don’t let him get you, <PER>Harry</PER> — don’t let go!” She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to <PER>Harry</PER>, and hissed words <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t hear to <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
And now another head was emerging from the tip of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand and <PER>Harry</PER> knew when <PER>Harry</PER> saw it who it would be <PER>Harry</PER> knew, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand knew, because the woman was the one he’d thought of more than any other tonight.
He walked close to <PER>Harry</PER>, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>, and He spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that <PER>Voldemort</PER>, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around his, could not hear .
“When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments but we will give you time you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts do you understand, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s hand had closed on Cedric’s wrist; one tombstone stood between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, but Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reach — <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s red eyes flamed in the darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth curl into a smile, saw <PER>Harry</PER> raise <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught it by the handle — <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s scream of fury at the same moment that <PER>Voldemort</PER> felt the jerk behind <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s navel that meant the Portkey had worked — it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> slam flat into the ground; <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled <PER>Harry</PER>'s nostrils.
<PER>Harry</PER> had closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes while the Portkey transported <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> kept them closed now.
All the breath seemed to have been knocked out of <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was swimming so badly <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the ground beneath <PER>Harry</PER> were swaying like the deck of a ship.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s dead!” The words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around them and then others shouted it — screeched it — into the night — “He’s dead!” “He’s dead!” “Cedric Diggory!
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you can’t help <PER>Harry</PER> now.
“<PER>Harry</PER> wanted me to bring <PER>Harry</PER> back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents.
<PER>Harry</PER> injured leg would no longer support <PER>Harry</PER>'s weight.
“He’s ill, He’s injured — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Diggory’s parents, they’re here, — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Diggory’s parents, they’re in the stands.
“It’s all right, son, I’ve got you come on hospital wing ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said stay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> thickly, the pounding in <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar making <PER>Harry</PER> feel as though <PER>Harry</PER> was about to throw up; <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision was blurring worse than ever.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting <PER>Harry</PER> pushed a path through people, taking <PER>Harry</PER> back to the castle.
Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, <PER>Harry</PER> heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping <PER>Harry</PER> walk.
“What happened, <PER>Harry</PER>?” the man asked at last as the man lifted <PER>Harry</PER> up the stone steps.
“Took me and Cedric to a graveyard and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was there Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> ” Clunk.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Blood,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> should have told <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> should have said it straightaway “There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts!
“You didn’t do that you can’t have done ” “I assure you I did,” said Moody, and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was making sure that there was no one outside it.
The door was barred, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> would never reach <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand in time.
<PER>Harry</PER>, still staring at the place where Moody’s face had been, saw Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looking back at <PER>Harry</PER> out of the Foe-Glass.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in front, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand outstretched.
At that moment, <PER>Harry</PER> fully understood for the first time why people said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was the only wizard <PER>Voldemort</PER> had ever feared.
The look upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face as he stared down at the unconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more terrible than <PER>Harry</PER> could have ever imagined.
There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were giving off burning heat.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moody’s unconscious body, and kicked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> over onto <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s back, so that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face was visible.
<PER>Snape</PER> followed <PER>Snape</PER>, looking into the Foe-Glass, where <PER>Snape</PER>'s own face was still visible, glaring into the room.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> went straight to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ought to — look at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s been through enough tonight — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will stay, Minerva, because <PER>Dumbledore</PER> needs to understand,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> curtly.
Then He turned to Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched, astounded, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk, and each time revealing different contents.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and <PER>Harry</PER> let out a cry of amazement.
<PER>Harry</PER> wooden leg was gone, the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath the magical eye lid, and chunks of <PER>Harry</PER>'s grizzled hair were missing.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> climbed into the trunk, lowered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping Moody.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> bent over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Polyjuice Potion, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw a man lying before <PER>Harry</PER>, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew who <PER>Harry</PER> was.
<PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER> in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve, had watched <PER>Harry</PER> being led away from court by the dementors, trying to convince Mister Crouch that he was innocent but <PER>Harry</PER> was lined around the eyes now and looked much older .
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> got up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled <PER>Dumbledore</PER> into a sitting position against the wall beneath the Foe- Glass, in which the reflections of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>McGonagall</PER> were still glaring down upon them all.
Then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pointed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand at the man’s chest and said, “Rennervate.” Crouch’s son opened Crouch’s son's eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knelt before <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, so that their faces were level.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with disgust on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face.
Then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly.
“Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take <PER>Harry</PER> upstairs?” “Of course,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Severus” — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to <PER>Snape</PER> — “please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said gently.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up and swayed again; the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg, which <PER>Harry</PER> had not noticed all the time <PER>Harry</PER> had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure.
<PER>Harry</PER> also realized that <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> gripped <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s arm and helped <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out into the dark corridor.
“Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> mumbled, “where are Mister and Mistress Diggory?” “They are with Professor Sprout,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave the password, it sprang aside, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door.
So tired every bone in <PER>Harry</PER>'s body was aching, <PER>Harry</PER> wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until <PER>Harry</PER> fell asleep and didn’t have to think or feel anymore.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat down opposite <PER>Harry</PER>, behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, who avoided <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was going to question <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was going to make <PER>Harry</PER> relive everything.
“I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had put a hand on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
Very unwillingly, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and looked into those blue eyes.
It shivered in the air, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat into <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach, warming <PER>Harry</PER>, and strengthening him.
As <PER>Harry</PER> spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes; <PER>Harry</PER> saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived <PER>Voldemort</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; <PER>Harry</PER> saw Cedric’s body, lying on the ground beside the cup.
Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to stop <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now <PER>Harry</PER> had started.
It was even a relief; <PER>Harry</PER> felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from <PER>Harry</PER>.
It was costing <PER>Harry</PER> every bit of determination <PER>Harry</PER> had to keep talking, yet <PER>Harry</PER> sensed that once <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, <PER>Harry</PER> would feel better.
When <PER>Harry</PER> told of Wormtail piercing <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood up so quickly that <PER>Harry</PER> started.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked around the desk and told <PER>Harry</PER> to stretch out <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> showed them both the place where <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes were torn and the cut beneath them.
“<PER>Harry</PER> said my blood would make <PER>Harry</PER> stronger than if him’d used someone else’s,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
But next second, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> had imagined it, for when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had returned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat behind the desk, <PER>Harry</PER> looked as old and weary as <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen him.
Then “<PER>Voldemort</PER> told how <PER>Voldemort</PER> had untied <PER>Voldemort</PER>, returned <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and prepared to duel.
But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wands, <PER>Voldemort</PER> found <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s throat obstructed.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had come out of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand were flooding into <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s mind.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins his father his mother <PER>Voldemort</PER> was glad when Sirius broke the silence.
“The wands connected?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said, looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Why?” <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked up at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> again, on whose face there was an arrested look.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s wand and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand share cores.
At this point, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> could not continue.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at Sirius and saw that <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s face in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left <PER>Harry</PER>'s knee.
<PER>Harry</PER> transformed back into the great black dog and walked with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out of the office, accompanying <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pushed open the door, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Molly, Bill, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey.
They appeared to be demanding to know where <PER>Harry</PER> was and what had happened to <PER>Harry</PER>.
All of them whipped around as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and the black dog entered, and Molly let out a kind of muffled scream.
She rounded on <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear?
“I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
As Madam Pomfrey led <PER>Harry</PER> to a nearby bed, <PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of the real Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room.
“he’ll be fine,” said Madam Pomfrey, giving <PER>Harry</PER> some pajamas and pulling screens around <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Bill, Molly, and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> becoming drowsy at once.
Everything around <PER>Harry</PER> became hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at <PER>Harry</PER> in a friendly way through the screen around <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed; <PER>Harry</PER>'s body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t open <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, wanting to drop off again.
The room was still dimly lit; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t have been asleep very long.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> heard whispering around <PER>Harry</PER>.
“When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> finds out — ” <PER>Harry</PER> heard the hospital doors burst open.
Unnoticed by any of the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens, <PER>Harry</PER> sat up and put <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses back on.
Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER> were at his heels.
“What has happened?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply, looking from Fudge to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“The Minister has seen to that!” <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> lose control like this.
“When we told Mister Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight’s events,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, in a low voice, “<PER>Snape</PER> seemed to feel <PER>Snape</PER>'s personal safety was in question.
“I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle, but — ” “My dear woman!” roared Fudge, who likewise looked angrier than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen him, “as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous — ” But Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s voice drowned Fudge’s.
“The moment that — that thing entered the room,” she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, “it swooped down on Crouch and — and — ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a chill in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> struggled to find words to describe what had happened.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> did not need Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s to finish Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s sentence.
“It seems he has been responsible for several deaths!” “But he cannot now give testimony, <PER>Cornelius</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He too glanced at <PER>Harry</PER>, then looked back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and said, “You are — er — prepared to take <PER>Harry</PER>’s word on this, are you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” There was a moment’s silence, which was broken by Sirius growling.
“Certainly, I believe <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I heard Crouch’s confession, and I heard <PER>Harry</PER>’s account of what happened after <PER>Harry</PER> touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.” Fudge still had that strange smile on his face.
“You are prepared to believe that Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who well ” Fudge shot <PER>Harry</PER> another look, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly understood.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Molly, and Bill all jumped.
“It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe what <PER>Harry</PER> was hearing.
But now a short, angry wizard stood before <PER>Harry</PER>, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in <PER>Harry</PER>'s comfortable and ordered world — to believe that <PER>Voldemort</PER> could have risen.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> has returned,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> repeated.
“What madness is this?” “Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “or <PER>Voldemort</PER> will persuade them, as <PER>Voldemort</PER> did before, that <PER>Voldemort</PER> alone among wizards will give them them's rights and them's freedom!” “You — you cannot be serious!” Fudge gasped, shaking his head and retreating further from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants — people hate them, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — end of my career — ” “You are blinded,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, him's eyes blazing once more, “by the love of the office you hold, <PER>Cornelius</PER>!
Finally, He said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, “his can’t be back, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his just can’t be ” <PER>Snape</PER> strode forward, past <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as his went.
He stared, apparently repelled by the ugly mark on <PER>Snape</PER> ’s arm, then looked up at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and whispered, “I don’t know what you and your staff are playing at, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but I have heard enough.
The moment he had disappeared, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to look at the group around <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed.
him clapped a hand on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, kissed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.
“Minerva,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, turning to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “I want to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> in my office as soon as possible.
“It’s okay!” <PER>Snape</PER> had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on <PER>Snape</PER>'s face was one of mingled fury and horror.
“You’ll see me very soon, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Sirius, turning to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Severus,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, turning to <PER>Snape</PER>, “you know what I must ask you to do.
“Then good luck,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> watched, with a trace of apprehension on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face, as <PER>Snape</PER> swept wordlessly after Sirius.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Mistress Weasley were all looking at him.
None of <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Mistress Weasley spoke for a very long time.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was holding something tight in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
From what <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> told him, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast.
He liked it best when He was with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and they were talking about other things, or else letting He sit in silence while they played chess.
The only time they touched upon the subject was when <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> about a meeting Molly had had with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> before going home.
“She went to ask <PER>Harry</PER> if you could come straight to us this summer,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“But <PER>Harry</PER> wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least at first.” “Why?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“She said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s got <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s reasons,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shaking his head darkly.
“I suppose we’ve got to trust him, haven’t we?” The only person apart from <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> felt able to talk to was <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“ <PER>Harry</PER>\” He strode out to meet them, pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into a one- armed hug, ruffled <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair, and said, “Good ter see yeh, mate.
When he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> closely through <PER>Harry</PER>'s beetle-black eyes.
“Knew he was goin’ ter come back,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up at him, shocked.
“Yeh did as much as yer father would’ve done, an’ I can’ give yeh no higher praise than that.” <PER>Harry</PER> smiled back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked you to do, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” ’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked.
“He sent Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> — that night.” “Got a little job fer me over the summer,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
k k k It was with a heavy heart that <PER>Harry</PER> packed <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk up in the dormitory on the night before <PER>Harry</PER>'s return to Privet Drive.
When he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the Hall, he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> saw at once that the usual decorations were missing.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t blame <PER>Harry</PER>; Moody’s fear of attack was bound to have been increased by <PER>Harry</PER>'s ten-month imprisonment in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own trunk.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered, as <PER>Harry</PER> sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether <PER>Voldemort</PER> had caught up with <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
Further along the table, sitting next to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, was <PER>Snape</PER>.
His eyes lingered on <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment as <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> continued to watch <PER>Harry</PER>, long after <PER>Snape</PER> had looked away.
What was it that <PER>Snape</PER> had done on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s orders, the night that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had returned?
And why why was <PER>Dumbledore</PER> so convinced that <PER>Snape</PER> was truly on their side?
<PER>Snape</PER> had turned spy against <PER>Voldemort</PER>, “at great personal risk.” Was that the job he had taken up again?
Pretended that he had never really gone over to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, that he had been, like <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself, biding his time?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s musings were ended by Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who stood up at the staff table.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> valued fair play.
Over at the Slytherin table, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
<PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> to look back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I am talking, of course, about <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in <PER>Harry</PER>’s direction before flicking back to face <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter managed to escape Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
But through a gap in the standing figures, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who after all possessed no magical eye.
Krum, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though <PER>Harry</PER> expected <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to say something harsh.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> back to Hogsmeade station.
Beyond Fleur Delacour, far across the grounds, <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness.
“It ’az been a pleasure meeting you!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s spirits couldn’t help but lift slightly as <PER>Harry</PER> watched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime, Fleur's silvery hair rippling in the sunlight.
“The carriages’ll be here in a minute!” He let <PER>Harry</PER> keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few minutes craning <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and <PER>Hermione</PER> might be up to.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared at <PER>Hermione</PER>, but her face was quite impassive.
Krum held out Krum's hand as Fleur had done, shook <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, and then <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
Krum had already started walking away when <PER>Ron</PER> burst out, “Can I have your autograph?” <PER>Hermione</PER> turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had managed to get a compartment to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> talked more fully and freely than <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had all week as the train sped them southward.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s speech at the Leaving Feast had unblocked <PER>Harry</PER>, somehow.
They broke off They's conversation about what action <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might be taking, even now, to stop <PER>Voldemort</PER> only when the lunch trolley arrived.
When <PER>Hermione</PER> returned from the trolley and put <PER>Hermione</PER>'s money back into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s schoolbag, <PER>Hermione</PER> dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet that <PER>Hermione</PER> had been carrying in there.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at it, unsure whether <PER>Harry</PER> really wanted to know what it might say, but <PER>Hermione</PER>, seeing <PER>Harry</PER> looking at it, said calmly, “There’s nothing in there.
“Not on a story like this.” “Oh, <PER>Rita</PER> hasn’t written anything at all since the third task,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in an oddly constrained voice.
“I found out how “<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was listening in on private conversations when “<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter wasn’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rush.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that <PER>Hermione</PER> had been dying to tell them this for days, but that <PER>Hermione</PER> had restrained <PER>Hermione</PER> in light of everything else that had happened.
“How was <PER>Hermione</PER> doing it?” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
“No, you see <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter” — <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s voice trembled with quiet triumph — “is an unregistered Animagus.
“There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard <PER>Hagrid</PER> telling Madame Maxime about his mum!” “Exactly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Very clever, Granger,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not been this close to <PER>Malfoy</PER> since <PER>Harry</PER> had watched <PER>Harry</PER> muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s speech about Cedric.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel a kind of ringing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
<PER>Harry</PER> hand gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand under his robes.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were on He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, all three of He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> having used a different hex.
But <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept on asking, and finally, Fred said, “All right, all right, if you really want to know it was Ludo Bagman.” “Bagman?” said <PER>Harry</PER> sharply.
The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; <PER>Harry</PER> wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that <PER>Harry</PER> would never arrive at King’s Cross but as <PER>Harry</PER> had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> struggled out past <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying their trunks.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled open <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and drew out <PER>Harry</PER>'s Triwizard winnings.
She hugged <PER>Harry</PER> very tightly when She saw <PER>Harry</PER> and whispered in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear, “I think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will let you come to us later in the summer.
“ ’Bye, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> did something <PER>Hermione</PER> had never done before, and kissed <PER>Harry</PER> on the cheek.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s appearance did not endear <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s to the neighbors, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden he behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby.
On the whole, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was to be congratulated on <PER>Harry</PER>'s idea of hiding here.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at <PER>Harry</PER>, grinding their teeth so loudly that <PER>Harry</PER> could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at <PER>Harry</PER>, as had happened every time <PER>Harry</PER> had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt and uncle.
<PER>Harry</PER> listened to a jingle about Fruit ’N Bran breakfast cereal while <PER>Harry</PER> watched Mistress Figg, a batty, cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very pleased that <PER>Harry</PER> was concealed behind the bush; Mistress Figg had recently taken to asking <PER>Harry</PER> around for tea whenever Mistress Figg met <PER>Harry</PER> in the street.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well that <PER>Dudley</PER> had not been to tea anywhere; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and throwing stones at passing cars and children.
<PER>Harry</PER> had seen them at it during <PER>Harry</PER>'s evening walks around Little Whinging; <PER>Harry</PER> had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way.
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o’clock news reached <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears and <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach turned over.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer.
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ living room, and as though <PER>Harry</PER> had been waiting for this signal, <PER>Harry</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans a thin wooden wand as if <PER>Harry</PER> were unsheathing a sword.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as if <PER>Harry</PER>'s head had been split in two; eyes streaming, <PER>Harry</PER> swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise, but <PER>Harry</PER> had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“Now\ Before — anyone — sees!” “Get — off — me!” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped; for a few seconds they struggled, <PER>Harry</PER> pulling at <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle’s sausage- like fingers with <PER>Harry</PER>'s left hand, <PER>Harry</PER>'s right maintaining a firm grip on <PER>Harry</PER>'s raised wand.
Then, as the pain in the top of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released <PER>Harry</PER> as though he had received an electric shock — some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making he impossible to hold.
<PER>Harry</PER> stuffed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand hastily back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans and tried to look innocent.
“Well, that’s news to me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call <PER>Harry</PER> back, <PER>Harry</PER> had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up the street.
<PER>Harry</PER> was in trouble now and <PER>Harry</PER> knew it.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have to face <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt and uncle later and pay the price for <PER>Harry</PER>'s rudeness, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not care very much just at the moment; <PER>Harry</PER> had much more pressing matters on <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
As this thought occurred him wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted again and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible <PER>Harry</PER> walked on, hardly aware of the route <PER>Harry</PER> was taking, for <PER>Harry</PER> had pounded these streets so often lately that <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet carried <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s favorite haunts automatically.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a dull, sinking sensation in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach and, before <PER>Harry</PER> knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again Tomorrow morning him would be awoken by the alarm at five o’clock so that him could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet — but was there any point in continuing to take it?
<PER>Harry</PER> merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind <PER>Harry</PER> cared about.
If <PER>Harry</PER> was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from <PER>Harry</PER>'s best friends, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, though any expectation he had had that their letters would bring he news had long since been dashed.
As far as <PER>Harry</PER> could tell from the vague hints in their letters, <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were in the same place, presumably at <PER>Ron</PER>’s parents’ house.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the Burrow when <PER>Harry</PER> was stuck in Privet Drive.
In fact, <PER>Harry</PER> was so angry at them that <PER>Harry</PER> had thrown both them's birthday presents of Honeydukes chocolates away unopened, though he had regretted this after eating the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.
And what were <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> busy with?
Don’t think about that, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> sternly for the hundredth time that summer.
It was bad enough that <PER>Harry</PER> kept revisiting the graveyard in <PER>Harry</PER>'s nightmares, without dwelling on it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s waking moments too.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along <PER>Harry</PER> passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where <PER>Harry</PER> had first clapped eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather.
Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how <PER>Harry</PER> was feeling; admittedly <PER>Harry</PER>'s letters were just as empty of proper news as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints: “ I know this must be frustrating for you” “Keep your nose clean and everything will be okay” “Be careful and don’t do anything rash” Well, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, <PER>Harry</PER> had (by and large) done as Sirius advised; <PER>Harry</PER> had at least resisted the temptation to tie <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk to <PER>Harry</PER>'s broomstick and set off for the Burrow by <PER>Harry</PER>.
In fact <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER>'s behavior had been very good considering how frustrated and angry <PER>Harry</PER> felt at being stuck in Privet Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> was doing.
Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool he that <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> or Sirius would find that very interesting anymore In the past his scar hurting had warned that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was getting stronger again, but now that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was back they would probably remind <PER>Voldemort</PER> that its regular irritation was only to be expected Nothing to worry about old news The injustice of it all welled up inside <PER>Voldemort</PER> so that <PER>Voldemort</PER> wanted to yell with fury.
And <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that <PER>Voldemort</PER> could hear about water-skiing budgerigars!
How could <PER>Dumbledore</PER> have forgotten <PER>Dumbledore</PER> so easily?
Why had <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> got together without inviting him along too?
These furious thoughts whirled around in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around <PER>Harry</PER>, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings.
“The noble sport,” as Uncle Vernon called it, had made <PER>Dudley</PER> even more formidable than he had seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> in the primary school days when <PER>Harry</PER> had served as <PER>Dudley</PER>’s first punching bag.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not remotely afraid of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cousin anymore but <PER>Harry</PER> still didn’t think that <PER>Dudley</PER> learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration.
Look round, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> thinking as <PER>Harry</PER> watched them.
Come on look round I’m sitting here all alone Come and have ago If <PER>Dudley</PER>’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would <PER>Dudley</PER> do then?
him wouldn’t want to lose face in front of the gang, but He’d be terrified of provoking <PER>Harry</PER> It would be really fun to watch <PER>Dudley</PER>’s dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond and if any of the others tried hitting <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was ready — he had his wand let them try He’d love to vent some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell — But they did not turn around, they did not see <PER>Harry</PER>, they were almost at the railings.
<PER>Harry</PER> mastered the impulse to call after they Seeking a fight was not a smart move <PER>Harry</PER> must not use magic <PER>Harry</PER> would be risking expulsion again <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road.
Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock <PER>Harry</PER> in the shed if <PER>Harry</PER> came home after <PER>Dudley</PER> again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, <PER>Harry</PER> set off toward the park gate.
<PER>Harry</PER> preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and <PER>Harry</PER> ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about <PER>Harry</PER>'s “delinquent” appearance when <PER>Harry</PER> passed the householders.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang came into view again; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent.
When their voices had faded once more <PER>Harry</PER> headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly <PER>Harry</PER> soon came within hailing distance of <PER>Dudley</PER>, who was strolling along at <PER>Harry</PER>'s ease, humming tunelessly.
The effort of keeping himself from hitting <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to be demanding all <PER>Harry</PER>'s self-control.
“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, <PER>Harry</PER>'s grin fading.
It gave <PER>Harry</PER> enormous satisfaction to know how furious <PER>Harry</PER> was making <PER>Dudley</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> was siphoning off <PER>Harry</PER>'s own frustration into <PER>Harry</PER>'s cousin, the only outlet <PER>Harry</PER> had.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped too, staring at <PER>Harry</PER>'s cousin.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pointing the wand directly at <PER>Dudley</PER>’s heart.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel fourteen years’ hatred of <PER>Dudley</PER> pounding in <PER>Harry</PER>'s veins — what wouldn’t <PER>Harry</PER> give to strike now, to jinx <PER>Dudley</PER> so thoroughly <PER>Harry</PER>’d have to crawl home like an insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers — “Don’t ever talk about that again,” <PER>Harry</PER> snarled.
For a split second <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>’d been resisting as hard as <PER>Harry</PER> could — then <PER>Harry</PER>'s reason caught up with <PER>Harry</PER>'s senses — <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have the power to turn off the stars.
— <PER>Harry</PER> turned — <PER>Harry</PER>'s head this way and that, trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on — <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes like a weightless veil.
<PER>Dudley</PER>’s terrified voice broke in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a horrible jolt of dread as <PER>Harry</PER> stood trembling in the freezing air.
Small white lights popped in front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes; for the second time in an hour <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s head had been cleaved in two; next moment <PER>Harry</PER> had landed hard on the ground, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand had flown out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“You moron, <PER>Dudley</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes watering with pain, as <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in the blackness.
At the same moment, <PER>Harry</PER> felt a creeping chill behind <PER>Harry</PER> that could mean only one thing.
Wand!” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered frantically, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands flying over the ground like spiders.
<PER>Harry</PER> snatched it up, scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, and turned around.
Stumbling backward, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“Expecto Patronurrd” A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, <PER>Harry</PER> retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain — concentrate — A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s robes, reaching for him.
“Expecto PatronumV’ His voice sounded dim and distant Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand — His couldn’t do it anymore, His couldn’t work the spell — There was laughter inside His's own head, shrill, high- pitched laughter His could smell the dementor’s putrid, death-cold breath, filling His's own lungs, drowning His — Think something happy But there was no happiness in him The dementor’s icy fingers were closing on him's throat — the high- pitched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside him's head — “Bow to death, <PER>Harry</PER> It might even be painless I would not know I have never died” <PER>Harry</PER> was never going to see <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> again — And their faces burst clearly into his mind as his fought for breath — An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand; its antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood quite still, all <PER>Harry</PER>'s senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to normality.
After a moment <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that <PER>Harry</PER>'s T-shirt was sticking to he; he was drenched in sweat.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent down to see whether <PER>Harry</PER> was in a fit state to stand up, but then heard loud, running footsteps behind <PER>Harry</PER>; instinctively raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand again, <PER>Harry</PER> spun on <PER>Harry</PER>'s heel to face the newcomer.
<PER>Harry</PER> made to stow <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand hurriedly out of sight, but — “Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked.
“Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!” “You know <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at her.
“Of course I know <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who doesn’t know <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
“I’ll do it.” <PER>Harry</PER> took hold of <PER>Dudley</PER>’s arm and heaved: With an enormous effort <PER>Harry</PER> managed to hoist <PER>Dudley</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Dudley</PER> seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading His's face; the moment <PER>Harry</PER> let go of <PER>Harry</PER> swayed dangerously.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled one of <PER>Dudley</PER>’s massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under him's weight.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER>'s cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but <PER>Dudley</PER> seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement.
<PER>Harry</PER> was slumped on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, <PER>Harry</PER>'s large feet dragging along the ground.
“Now come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, what are you waiting for?” <PER>Harry</PER> decided not to waste <PER>Harry</PER>'s remaining breath on pointing out that <PER>Harry</PER> could barely walk under <PER>Dudley</PER>’s bulk.
“Just in case there are more of them around Oh my word, what a catastrophe and you had to fight them off yourself and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs Well, it’s no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose but the cat’s among the pixies now ” “So,” <PER>Harry</PER> panted, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s been having me followed?” “Of course <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has,” said Mistress Figg impatiently.
“Wait!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted after her; <PER>Harry</PER> had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; but within seconds Mistress Figg was swallowed by the darkness.
Scowling, <PER>Harry</PER> readjusted <PER>Dudley</PER> on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number four’s garden path.
<PER>Harry</PER> stuck <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back inside the waistband of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia’s outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door.
With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, <PER>Harry</PER> removed <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys.
“Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon wouldn’t believe <PER>Harry</PER>.
When <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t reply, <PER>Harry</PER> pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s just arrived at the Ministry, and <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s’s trying to sort it all out.
A small shoot of hope burgeoned in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest, almost immediately strangled by panic — how was <PER>Harry</PER> supposed to refuse to surrender <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand without doing magic?
he was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew that Mister Weasley had Mister Weasley's best interests at heart and, after all, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had sorted out much worse than this before “Right,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “I’ve changed my mind, I’m staying.” <PER>Harry</PER> flung <PER>Harry</PER> down at the kitchen table and faced <PER>Dudley</PER> and Aunt Petunia.
“The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,” said <PER>Harry</PER> calmly; <PER>Harry</PER> was straining <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears to catch noises outside in case the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon’s questions than to have Uncle Vernon’s start raging and bellowing.
“That wasn’t me — ” “Was,” muttered <PER>Dudley</PER> unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at <PER>Harry</PER> to quiet <PER>Harry</PER> while they both bent low over <PER>Dudley</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> understood: <PER>Dudley</PER> was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you.
“If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use their names?” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, but Aunt Petunia ignored <PER>Harry</PER>.
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to <PER>Dudley</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> as if hoping somebody was going to shout “April Fool!” When nobody did, he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright.
“Well, if that’s all,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
He was desperate to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, or Sirius.
“I want to know exactly what happened to my son!” “FINE!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, and in <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper, red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand, still clutched in his hand.
“<PER>Dudley</PER> and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, speaking fast, fighting to control <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper.
“ — a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house and I won’t have it, boy, I won’t — ” “I can’t stop the owls coming,” <PER>Harry</PER> snapped, crushing Sirius’s letter in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist.
Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the dementors, had they deserted Azkaban and joined <PER>Voldemort</PER>, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had predicted they would?
“Then why — ?” “He must have sent them,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, more to <PER>Harry</PER> than to Uncle Vernon.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside down: The Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and Mistress Figg knew Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; dementors were soaring around Little Whinging and Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might never go back to Hogwarts.
Aunt Petunia was looking at <PER>Harry</PER> as Aunt Petunia had never looked at <PER>Harry</PER> before.
And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, <PER>Harry</PER> fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s sister.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not have said why this hit <PER>Harry</PER> so very powerfully at this moment.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that <PER>Harry</PER> was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> being back might mean.
“I see,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from Uncle Vernon's white- faced wife to <PER>Harry</PER> and hitching up <PER>Harry</PER>'s trousers.
DO NOT LEA VE YOUR A UNT AND UNCLE’S “You heard me!” said Uncle Vernon, bending forward now, so that Uncle Vernon's massive purple face came closer to <PER>Harry</PER>’s, so that <PER>Harry</PER> actually felt flecks of spit hit <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> was watching <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt, utterly bewildered, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head throbbing fit to burst.
He addressed the first to Sirius, the second to <PER>Ron</PER>, and the third to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head pounding, <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain too busy for sleep even though <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes stung and itched with tiredness.
<PER>Harry</PER> back ached from carrying <PER>Dudley</PER> home, and the two lumps on <PER>Harry</PER>'s head where the window and <PER>Dudley</PER> had hit him were throbbing painfully.
“Take these straight to Sirius, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and don’t come back here without good long replies.
The moment She’d gone, <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> down onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling.
But he’d make it up to Hedwig's when Hedwig came back with Sirius’s, <PER>Ron</PER>’s, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s answers.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent the day in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom.
Every time <PER>Harry</PER> heard her approaching <PER>Harry</PER> tried to question Aunt Petunia's about the Howler, but <PER>Harry</PER> might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers <PER>Harry</PER> got.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see the point of forcing <PER>Harry</PER>'s company on them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps making <PER>Harry</PER> so angry <PER>Harry</PER>’d perform more illegal magic.
<PER>Harry</PER> was filled alternately with restless energy that made <PER>Harry</PER> unable to settle to anything, during which <PER>Harry</PER> paced <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them for leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete that <PER>Harry</PER> could lie on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.
Whenever this thought occurred, <PER>Harry</PER> invariably slid off <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and began pacing again.
On the fourth night after Hedwig’s departure <PER>Harry</PER> was lying in one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, <PER>Harry</PER>'s exhausted mind quite blank, when <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle entered <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked slowly around at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Sorry?” “We — that is to say, your aunt, <PER>Dudley</PER>, and I — are going out.” “Fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER> dully, looking back at the ceiling.
“You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.” “Okay.” “You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions.” “Right.” “You are not to steal food from the fridge.” “Okay.” “I am going to lock your door.” “You do that.” Uncle Vernon glared at <PER>Harry</PER>, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom light.
The room grew steadily darker around <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> lay listening to the night sounds through the window <PER>Harry</PER> kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark upstairs landing, straining <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears for further sounds, but none came.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s room to the head of the stairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart shot upward into <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring at <PER>Harry</PER>, stowing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand into the back pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans as <PER>Harry</PER> came.
“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning <PER>Harry</PER> toward the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing <PER>Harry</PER> curiously.
“Yeah, I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER> uncomfortably; it felt odd to be introduced to somebody <PER>Harry</PER>’d thought <PER>Harry</PER>’d known for a year.
<PER>Harry</PER> inclined <PER>Harry</PER>'s head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished they would look at something other than <PER>Harry</PER>; it was as though <PER>Harry</PER> had suddenly been ushered onstage.
“A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,” said Lupin, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had read <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind; the corners of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth twitched slightly.
Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, <PER>Harry</PER> had not bothered tidying up after <PER>Harry</PER>.
Most of the books <PER>Harry</PER> owned were strewn over the floor where <PER>Harry</PER>’d tried to distract <PER>Harry</PER> with each in turn and thrown it aside.
<PER>Harry</PER> started picking up books and throwing them hastily into <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed her down the stairs carrying <PER>Harry</PER>'s broomstick.
“Come here, boy,” said Moody gruffly, beckoning <PER>Harry</PER> toward him with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s body, or rather, what had been <PER>Harry</PER>'s body, for it didn’t look anything like <PER>Harry</PER>'s anymore.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s right leg over <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt its vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more.
Tonks swerved and <PER>Harry</PER> followed her, watching <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom.
“We need more height Give it another quarter of a mile!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; <PER>Harry</PER>’s could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps.
Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon’s car The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition and <PER>Harry</PER> laughed aloud at the thought, though <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice was drowned by the flapping of the others’ robes, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air.
“We’ll get soaked, Mad-Eye!” <PER>Harry</PER> was relieved to hear her say this; <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands were growing numb on the Firebolt’s handle.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had thought to put on a coat; <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to shiver.
“We want to avoid the motorway!” <PER>Harry</PER> was now so chilled that <PER>Harry</PER> thought longingly for a moment of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight Now Emmeline Vance was on his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right then her too swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore “We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure We’re not being followed!” Moody shouted.
“Follow Tonks, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> followed Tonks into a dive.
“Wait till we’re inside!” He pulled the piece of parchment out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and set fire to the piece of parchment with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand tip.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought, and no sooner had <PER>Harry</PER> reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and saw the others filing in behind <PER>Harry</PER>, Lupin and Tonks carrying <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and Hedwig’s cage.
“Here — ” He rapped <PER>Harry</PER> hard over the head with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though something hot was trickling down <PER>Harry</PER>'s back this time and knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.
She was beaming in welcome as She hurried toward them, though <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that She was rather thinner and paler than She had been last time <PER>Harry</PER> had seen She.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s lovely to see you!” She whispered, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> into a rib-cracking hug before holding <PER>Harry</PER> at arm’s length and examining <PER>Harry</PER> critically.
“You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid” She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently, “him’s just arrived, the meeting’s started” The wizards behind <PER>Harry</PER> all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past <PER>Harry</PER> toward the door through which Molly had just come; <PER>Harry</PER> made to follow Lupin, but Molly held <PER>Harry</PER> back.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s bewilderment deepened with every step <PER>Harry</PER> took.
“Molly, why — ?” “<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to dash,” Molly whispered distractedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair — <PER>Hermione</PER> had thrown — <PER>Hermione</PER> onto him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat, while <PER>Ron</PER>’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round and round their heads.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, still beaming, let go of <PER>Harry</PER>, but before <PER>Hermione</PER> could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> was going spare, <PER>Hermione</PER> kept saying you’d do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> made us — ” “ — swear not to tell me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid month — he felt he would rather <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left he alone.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I mean.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yeah?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyebrows.
“Have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer?” “Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time — ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great jolt in <PER>Harry</PER>'s guts as though <PER>Harry</PER> had just missed a step going downstairs.
So everyone had known <PER>Harry</PER> was being followed except <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Didn’t work that well, though, did it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, doing <PER>Harry</PER>'s utmost to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice even.
“If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t have done magic and “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.” “Aren’t you aren’t you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked away from them, looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his spirits.
“So why’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> been so keen to keep me in the dark?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, still trying hard to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice casual.
“Did you — er — bother to ask <PER>Harry</PER> at all?” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was behaving just as them had feared <PER>Harry</PER> would.
“We told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> We wanted to tell you what was going on,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You’re not telling me he doesn’t know ways to send messages without owls.” <PER>Hermione</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER> and then said, “I thought that too.
Every bitter and resentful thought that <PER>Harry</PER> had had in the past month was pouring out of <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER>'s frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been together without <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s fury at being followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries.
<PER>Ron</PER> was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say, while <PER>Hermione</PER> looked on the verge of tears.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, we wanted to tell you, we really did — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER> did — ” “we wanted to — ” “No, honest — ” <PER>Harry</PER>, we’re really sorry!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> desperately, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes now sparkling with tears.
“You’re absolutely right, <PER>Harry</PER> — I’d be furious if it was me!” <PER>Harry</PER> glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again, pacing up and down.
“What is this place anyway?” he shot at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s in charge, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> founded it.
“Quite a few people — ” “ — we’ve met about twenty of them,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but we think there are more” <PER>Harry</PER> glared at them.
“Well what?” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>i” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously, and both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> winced.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked around the room again, looking anywhere but at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Stop doing that!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly red-haired as <PER>Ron</PER>, though stockier and slightly shorter.
“Oh hello, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s younger sister, <PER>Ginny</PER>, brightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure <PER>Harry</PER>'s anger had abated yet; but <PER>Harry</PER>'s thirst for information was now overcoming <PER>Harry</PER>'s urge to keep shouting.
“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s still in Romania, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s still in Romania trying to make contacts on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s still in Romania's days off.” “Couldn’t Percy do that?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> in a tense voice.
“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s friendly with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and he’s always thought Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle obsession — ” “But what’s this got to do with Percy?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, confused.
“He’s not stupid, He must know your mum and dad wouldn’t risk everything without proof — ” “Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shooting <PER>Harry</PER> a furtive look.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hurried on, “Well, you’d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they — um — they mention you a couple of times a week.” “But I’d have seen — ” “Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shaking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
“They’re just building on <PER>Rita</PER>’s stuff.” “But <PER>Rita</PER>’s not writing for them anymore, is she?” “Oh no, <PER>Rita</PER>’s kept <PER>Rita</PER>'s promise — not that <PER>Rita</PER>’s got any choice,” <PER>Hermione</PER> added with satisfaction.
“But <PER>Hermione</PER> laid the foundation for what they’re trying to do now.” “Which is what?” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently.
“Okay, you know <PER>Hermione</PER> wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who was not likely to forget <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s stories about him in a hurry.
“Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a great tragic hero or something,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for <PER>Harry</PER> to hear these facts quickly.
“<PER>Harry</PER> loves playing with them.” “Oh,” said Molly, “I thought it might have been Kreacher, <PER>Harry</PER> keeps doing odd things like that.
Both of them were watching <PER>Harry</PER> apprehensively, as though Both of Both of Both of them feared that <PER>Harry</PER> would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone.
“Look ” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, but <PER>Ron</PER> shook his head, and <PER>Hermione</PER> said quietly, “We knew you’d be angry, <PER>Harry</PER>, We really don’t blame you, but you’ve got to understand, We did try and persuade <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ” “Yeah, I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grudgingly.
<PER>Harry</PER> cast around for a topic to change the subject from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — the very thought of <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides burn with anger again.
“He’s not a nutter, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “His life’s ambition is to have His's head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like His's mother,” said <PER>Ron</PER> irritably.
“Is that normal, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Well — well, if he is a bit strange, it’s not his fault — ” <PER>Ron</PER> rolled his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> still hasn’t given up on spew — ” “It’s not ‘spew’!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> heatedly.
“It’s the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s not just me, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says we should be kind to Kreacher too — ” “Yeah, yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“C’mon, I’m starving.” He led the way out of the door and onto the landing, but before they could descend the stairs — “Hold it!” <PER>Ron</PER> breathed, flinging out an arm to stop <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> walking any farther.
In the very center of the group <PER>Harry</PER> saw the dark, greasy-haired head and prominent nose of his least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very interested in what <PER>Snape</PER> was doing for the Order of the Phoenix A thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes.
“<PER>Snape</PER> never eats here,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she was being tortured — then <PER>Harry</PER> realized it was simply a life-size portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
The old woman was drooling, The old woman's eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin of The old woman's face stretched taut as The old woman screamed, and all along the hall behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that <PER>Harry</PER> actually screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes at the noise and clapped <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands over <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
“Good to see you!” Over him's shoulder <PER>Harry</PER> saw Bill, who still wore shoulder <PER>Harry</PER>'s long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s arrived.” “Eh?” said Mundungus, peering balefully at <PER>Harry</PER> through his matted ginger hair.
<PER>Harry</PER> was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking mournfully at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I haven’t seen anyone.” “See, I wouldn’t ’ave left,” said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in his voice, “but I ’ad a business opportunity — ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt something brush against <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs, purring, then jumped onto Sirius’s lap and curled up.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a sudden upsurge of affection for <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather.
“Listening to <PER>Snape</PER>’s reports, having to take all <PER>Snape</PER>'s snide hints that <PER>Snape</PER>’s out there risking <PER>Snape</PER>'s life while I’m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time asking me how the cleaning’s going — ” “What cleaning?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the sarcasm in <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure that anyone else did.
Opposite <PER>Harry</PER>, Tonks was entertaining <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> by transforming her nose between mouthfuls.
Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression her had worn back in <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like <PER>Snape</PER>’s, shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril.
Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> started requesting their favorite noses.
“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks ” Tonks obliged, and <PER>Harry</PER>, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female <PER>Dudley</PER> was grinning at him from across the table.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked round at <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather.
“Knows all the crooks — well, <PER>Harry</PER> would, seeing as <PER>Harry</PER>’s one himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay down <PER>Harry</PER>'s spoon in a lull in the general conversation.
“I asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> said we’re not allowed in the Order, so — ” “And <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’re quite right,” said Molly.
“How come <PER>Harry</PER> gets <PER>Harry</PER>'s questions answered?” said Fred angrily.
“The bit about not telling <PER>Harry</PER> more than <PER>Harry</PER> needs to know,” said Molly, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and George’s heads turned from Sirius to Molly as though following a tennis rally.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with <PER>Ginny</PER>'s mouth slightly open.
“But as he was the one who saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> come back” (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), “<PER>Voldemort</PER> has more right than most to — ” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Molly.
“Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> keeps reminding you to stay at home and — ” “We’ll leave my instructions from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out of this, if you please!” said Sirius loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been touched by what Molly had said about <PER>Harry</PER>'s being as good as a son, but <PER>Harry</PER> was also impatient at Molly's mollycoddling Sirius was right, he was not a child.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — <PER>Ron</PER> — <PER>Hermione</PER> — Fred — George — I want you out of this kitchen, now.” There was instant uproar.
“If <PER>Harry</PER>’s allowed, why can’t I?” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>’ll tell me and <PER>Hermione</PER> everything you say anyway!” said <PER>Ron</PER> hotly.
For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> considered telling <PER>Ron</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t tell <PER>Harry</PER> a single word, that <PER>Harry</PER> could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how <PER>Harry</PER> liked it.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> beamed.
“Okay, <PER>Harry</PER> what do you want to know?” <PER>Harry</PER> took a deep breath and asked the question that had been obsessing <PER>Harry</PER> for a month.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had murdered more than once in the last year alone.
“And you made sure <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew at once.” “How has that helped?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was the only one <PER>Voldemort</PER> was ever scared of!” “Thanks to you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned,” said Sirius.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.” “So what does <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reckon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s planning?” “Well, firstly, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants to build up <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s army again,” said Sirius.
“You saw <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge after <PER>Voldemort</PER> came back, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Fudge is frightened of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, you see,” said Tonks sadly.
“Frightened of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> incredulously.
“You see, Fudge thinks <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s plotting to overthrow <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“How can he think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would just make it all up — that I’d make it all up?” “Because accepting that <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn’t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,” said Sirius bitterly.
“Why d’you think <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s in such trouble?” “What d’you mean?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> doesn’t march up to people’s houses and bang on their front doors, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Sirius.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not noticed her return from taking <PER>Ginny</PER> upstairs.
“If <PER>Ginny</PER>’s not lying awake waiting for <PER>Hermione</PER> to tell <PER>Hermione</PER>'s everything they said downstairs, then I’m a flobberworm” “All right, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Molly on the second landing, pointing them into them's bedroom.
“Off to bed with you.” “ ’Night,” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> said to the twins.
<PER>Harry</PER> put on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas, took off <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses, and climbed into <PER>Harry</PER>'s chilly bed while <PER>Ron</PER> threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER>'s outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window.
“What d’you reckon?” <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need to ask what <PER>Ron</PER> meant.
“Keep your voice down, <PER>Ron</PER>, or Mum’ll be back up here.” “You two just Apparated on my knees!” “Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark — ” <PER>Harry</PER> saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed.
“He doesn’t need anything more efficient than that.” There was a pause and <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the others, like <PER>Harry</PER>, were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.
“Look at <PER>Ginny</PER>.” “What d’you mean?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mum,” said George, and without further ado there was a loud crack and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the weight vanish from the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to think about that <PER>Harry</PER> fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to continue talking to <PER>Ron</PER>, but Molly was now creaking back downstairs again, and once Molly had gone <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly heard others making others's way upstairs In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, “Beauties, aren’ they, eh, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then Mum needs you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxies than Mum thought and Mum’s found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.” Half an hour later, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had dressed and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive- green walls covered in dirty tapestries.
It was around these that Molly, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Fred, and George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths.
“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Molly said to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> the moment ” Molly saw <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table.
<PER>Harry</PER> took as much time as <PER>Harry</PER> dared to close the drawing room door; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs.
He heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a deep voice He recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s just relieved me, so she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave a report for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>” Feeling Molly’s eyes on the back of his head, <PER>Harry</PER> regretfully closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party.
“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snack-boxes,” George told <PER>Harry</PER> under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath.
Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his nose, <PER>Harry</PER> moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, “What are Skiving Snackboxes?” “Range of sweets to make you ill,” George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Molly’s back.
“Joke shop still on, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on <PER>Harry</PER>'s spray.
They were crammed with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages <PER>Harry</PER> could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure was blood.
and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my Mistress knew, oh how my Mistress’d cry, and there’s a new boy, Kreacher doesn’t know Kreacher's name, what is Kreacher doing here, Kreacher doesn’t know ” “This is <PER>Harry</PER>, Kreacher,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” Kreacher’s pale eyes widened and <PER>Harry</PER> muttered faster and more furiously than ever.
“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would Kreacher’s Mistress say — ” “Don’t call Kreacher’s Mistress's a Mudblood!” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> together, very angrily.
“It doesn’t matter,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, “he’s not in his right mind, he doesn’t know what he’s — ” “Don’t kid yourself, <PER>Hermione</PER>, he knows exactly what he’s saying,” said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.
“Sirius, he’s not right in the head,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> pleadingly, “I don’t think he realizes we can hear he.” “he’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad orders from my mother’s portrait and talking to himself, but himself was always a foul little — ” “If you just set he free,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hopefully, “maybe — ” “We can’t set he free, he knows too much about the Order,” said Sirius curtly.
“I’d had enough.” “Where did you go?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, did not laugh; <PER>Harry</PER> was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda’s burn mark.
A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> curiously.
“Rodolphus ’s brother, Rabastan, was with Rodolphus ’s brother, Rabastan too.” And <PER>Harry</PER> remembered: <PER>Harry</PER> had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, her pride that her had tried to find him after him's downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for shis loyalty.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew how <PER>Harry</PER> would feel if forced, when <PER>Harry</PER> was grown up and thought <PER>Harry</PER> was free of the place forever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up and realized that Sirius had been watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried <PER>Harry</PER>'s best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass cabinets that afternoon.
“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, “must be Wartcap powder in there.” He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; <PER>Harry</PER> saw George wrap <PER>Harry</PER>'s own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into George's already doxy-filled pocket.
They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm like a spider when <PER>Harry</PER> picked it up, and attempted to puncture <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin; Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy.
<PER>Snape</PER> might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher.
Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said, “Master must do as Master wishes,” before turning away and muttering very loudly, “but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against <PER>Voldemort</PER>, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum” At which Sirius, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>’s protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.
<PER>Snape</PER> flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to <PER>Harry</PER>’s relief they never came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though she also seemed too busy to linger.
As long as <PER>Harry</PER> was busy <PER>Harry</PER> was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever <PER>Harry</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him.
The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not mentioning it.
<PER>Harry</PER> nodded and tried to keep eating <PER>Harry</PER>'s chops, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth had become so dry <PER>Harry</PER> could not chew.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over at Sirius, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could ask the question, Molly had answered it.
“When did <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tell you that?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, staring at Sirius.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s own eyes to <PER>Harry</PER>'s plate.
The thought that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been in the house on the eve of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hearing and not asked to see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> made <PER>Dumbledore</PER> feel, if that were possible, even worse.
<PER>Harry</PER> awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear.
For a few moments <PER>Harry</PER> lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain, then, unable to bear it, <PER>Harry</PER> leapt out of bed and put on <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses.
Trying not to think of the next time his would see <PER>Ron</PER>, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER> walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the door <PER>Harry</PER> heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and when <PER>Harry</PER> pushed it open <PER>Harry</PER> saw Mister and Molly, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for <PER>Harry</PER>.
Lupin glanced at <PER>Harry</PER>, then said to Tonks, “What were you saying about Scrimgeour?” “Oh yeah well, we need to be a bit more careful, he’s been asking Kingsley and me funny questions” <PER>Harry</PER> felt vaguely grateful that <PER>Harry</PER> was not required to join in the conversation.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“We’re a bit early, but I think you’ll be better off there than hanging around here.” “Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> automatically, dropping <PER>Harry</PER>'s toast and getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“You’ll be all right, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Tonks, patting <PER>Harry</PER> on the arm.
“You don’t normally walk to work, do you?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>, as they set off briskly around the square.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew it was clenched around <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“Four stops, <PER>Harry</PER> three stops left now two stops to go, <PER>Harry</PER> ” They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases.
“Where are we?” said Arthur blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment <PER>Harry</PER> thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Arthur’s continual references to the map; but a second later <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Ah yes this way, <PER>Harry</PER>,” and led him down a side road.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked it up: It was a square silver badge with <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it.
<PER>Harry</PER> pinned it to the front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing at all; <PER>Harry</PER> could only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made the telephone box way down through the earth.
As they passed the fountain <PER>Harry</PER> saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at <PER>Harry</PER> from the bottom of the pool.
A small, smudged sign beside it read: All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten Galleons, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> thinking desperately.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked closer to <PER>Harry</PER> and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down <PER>Harry</PER>’s front and back.
His eyes had darted from the silver visitor’s badge on <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest to <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
“Thank you, Eric,” said Arthur firmly, and grasping <PER>Harry</PER> by the shoulder, Arthur steered <PER>Harry</PER> away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates.
<PER>Harry</PER> and Arthur joined the crowd around one of <PER>Harry</PER> and Arthur.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> jammed against the back wall of the lift.
Several witches and wizards were looking at <PER>Harry</PER> curiously; <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet to avoid catching anyone’s eye, flattening <PER>Harry</PER>'s fringe as <PER>Harry</PER> did so.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared up at them as them flapped idly around above <PER>Harry</PER>'s head; them were a pale violet color and <PER>Harry</PER> could see MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the edges of them's wings.
“I’ve been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?” “Yes, if it really is a second,” said Arthur, “I’m in rather a hurry.” They were talking to each other as though They hardly knew each other, and when <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Arthur stood on Arthur's foot.
<PER>Harry</PER> received a slight shock; Sirius’s face was blinking down at <PER>Harry</PER> from every direction.
“And I’m afraid you’ll have to wait for information on motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the moment.” He dropped He's voice and said, “If you can get away before seven, Molly’s making meatballs.” He beckoned to <PER>Harry</PER> and led <PER>Harry</PER> out of Kingsley’s cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading MISUSE OF MUGGLE Arthur’s dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard.
“Quick, <PER>Harry</PER>, we should have been there five minutes ago!” Perkins flattened Perkins against the filing cabinets as Arthur left the office at a run, <PER>Harry</PER> on <PER>Harry</PER>'s heels.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> had left all <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides back at Perkins’s desk.
“Of course.” <PER>Harry</PER> barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s unfaltering gaze did not make <PER>Harry</PER> feel any more comfortable.
<PER>Harry</PER> gasped; <PER>Harry</PER> could not help <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from <PER>Harry</PER>, but none came.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drew level with <PER>Harry</PER> and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down <PER>Harry</PER>'s very crooked nose.
A powerful emotion had risen in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest at the sight of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave <PER>Harry</PER>.
He wanted to catch <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eye, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was not looking He's way; He was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge.
“However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.” “Yes — well — I suppose well need another chair — I — Weasley, could you — ?” “Not to worry, not to worry,” said “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> pleasantly; ““<PER>Dumbledore</PER> took out ““<PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat down, put the tips of “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest.
“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because — ” “A corporeal Patronus?” “A — what?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cleared <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s throat.
he stared down at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling he back together, said, “We haven’t got time to listen to more taradiddles, I’m afraid, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood up and gave Mistress Figg <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s chair, conjuring a second one for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I have already given you my views on this matter, <PER>Cornelius</PER>.” “Yes, you have,” said Fudge forcefully, “and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took <PER>Harry</PER> aback; <PER>Harry</PER> had been expecting a croak.
“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> politely.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> inclined <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head in a little bow.
“We are here to examine <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery!” “Of course we are,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant.
“Then we are in agreement that <PER>Harry</PER>’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes?” “If there were dementors, which I doubt — ” “You have heard from an eyewitness,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> interrupted.
“It’s — I want this over with today, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“And I haven’t even started on what his gets up to at school — ” “ — but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school, <PER>Harry</PER>’s behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words.
“As far as I am aware, however,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> continued, “there is no law yet in place that says this court’s job is to punish <PER>Harry</PER> for every bit of magic <PER>Harry</PER> has ever performed.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, seeking reassurance; <PER>Harry</PER> was not at all sure that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a decision.
Again, however, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed oblivious to <PER>Harry</PER>’s attempt to catch <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart, which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not at all sure that <PER>Harry</PER> had made a good impression.
<PER>Harry</PER> ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how <PER>Harry</PER> had fallen over, about how both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dudley</PER> had nearly been kissed Twice <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at Fudge and opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to speak, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s swollen heart was now constricting <PER>Harry</PER>'s air passages and both times <PER>Harry</PER> merely took a deep breath and looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoes.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to look up at the judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining <PER>Harry</PER>'s laces.
his took two deep breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, “Very well, very well cleared of all charges.” “Excellent,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> briskly, springing to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet, pulling out <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s abrupt departure took <PER>Harry</PER> completely by surprise.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained sitting where <PER>Harry</PER> was in the chained chair, struggling with <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings of shock and relief.
Nobody seemed to be paying <PER>Harry</PER> the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s right, who was now gazing down at <PER>Harry</PER> instead of at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Ignoring her, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting to ask whether <PER>Harry</PER> was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice <PER>Harry</PER>, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so <PER>Harry</PER> took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody called <PER>Harry</PER> back, broke into a very fast walk.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t say — ” “Cleared,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, pulling the door closed behind <PER>Harry</PER>, “of all charges!” Beaming, Arthur seized <PER>Harry</PER> by the shoulders.
“Merlin’s beard,” said Arthur wonderingly, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> aside to let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?” “I think so,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge acted as though Arthur and <PER>Harry</PER> were part of the wall, but again, the toadlike witch looked almost appraisingly at <PER>Harry</PER> as she passed.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt winded, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had just walked into something heavy.
<PER>Harry</PER> had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death Eater’s hood, and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> tortured him.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not believe that Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> dared look Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the face; Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> could not believe that Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge was talking to <PER>Harry</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> had told Fudge mere weeks ago that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was a Death Eater.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “yeah, I’m good at escaping” Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> raised ” Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes to Arthur’s face.
“Not here, surely?” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, raising Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyebrows and glancing toward the door over Mister Weasley’s shoulder.
“What are you doing here anyway?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“I don’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, smoothing the front of his robes; <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold.
“Really, just because you are <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s favorite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?” “Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on <PER>Harry</PER> and Arthur.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s been giving generously to all sorts of things for years Gets him in with the right people then him can ask favors delay laws him doesn’t want passed Oh, him’s very well connected, Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>” The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around Arthur’s head as Arthur’s pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors clanged shut; Arthur’s waved them away irritably.
“Arthur,” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly, “if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like <PER>Malfoy</PER>, if <PER>Harry</PER>’s seeing them alone, how do we know them haven’t put the Imperius Curse on him?” “Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, <PER>Harry</PER>,” muttered Arthur.
“But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thinks Fudge is acting of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own accord at the moment — which, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says, is not a lot of comfort Best not talk about it anymore just now, <PER>Harry</PER>” The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted Atrium.
Arthur looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> looked rather weak and foolish.
With a grin at the thought of what <PER>Hermione</PER> would say if <PER>Hermione</PER> could see the statue of the elf, <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s money bag upside down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues’ feet.
“You always get away with stuff!” “They were bound to clear you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had looked positively faint with anxiety when <PER>Harry</PER> had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes.
“Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> got off Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> got off Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> got off — ” “Be quiet, you three!
“<PER>Harry</PER> dear, come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than themselves had done since him had first arrived at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s feeling of giddy relief, which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, swelled again.
“ ’Course, once <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you,” said <PER>Ron</PER> happily, now dishing great mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates.
“But it’s nothing It happens all the time now” None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping them to food while gloating over <PER>Harry</PER>’s narrow escape; Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were still singing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather anxious, but before <PER>Hermione</PER> could say anything, <PER>Ron</PER> said happily, “I bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.” “I don’t think he’ll be able to, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said Molly, setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Over the next few days <PER>Harry</PER> could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly overjoyed that <PER>Harry</PER> would be returning to Hogwarts.
Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and beaming just like the rest of them; soon, however, <PER>Harry</PER> was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to everybody, even <PER>Harry</PER>, and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s room with Buckbeak.
“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sternly, after <PER>Harry</PER> had confided some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER> while they scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later.
“You know, maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time — we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds — ” “I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered irritably, but only so <PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached; <PER>Harry</PER> could not wait to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses.
The fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-<PER>Voldemort</PER> movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as <PER>Harry</PER> would have expected before <PER>Harry</PER>’d experienced it.
Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few minutes’ whispered conversation, Molly made sure that <PER>Harry</PER> and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that <PER>Harry</PER> needed to know anything more than <PER>Harry</PER> had heard on the night of <PER>Harry</PER>'s arrival.
On the very last day of the holidays <PER>Harry</PER> was sweeping up Hedwig’s owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when <PER>Ron</PER> entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.
“About time, I thought they’d forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this” <PER>Harry</PER> swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw a rubbish bag over <PER>Ron</PER>’s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly.
“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,” Fred told <PER>Harry</PER>, “and from what they were saying, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.” “Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s happened to the last four?” said George.
“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in a trunk for nine months,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, counting them off on <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Ron</PER> was standing very still with <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth slightly open, gaping at <PER>Harry</PER>'s letter from Hogwarts.
“No one in their right mind would make <PER>Ron</PER> a prefect” The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them stared at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Prefect ickle <PER>Ron</PER>nie the prefect ” “Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge back at <PER>Ron</PER> as though it might contaminate him.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a moment, and then held it out to <PER>Harry</PER> as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine.
<PER>Hermione</PER> came tearing into the room, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cheeks flushed and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair flying.
“Me too, <PER>Harry</PER>, me too!” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, pushing the badge back into <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand.
“It’s <PER>Ron</PER>, not me.” “It — what?” “<PER>Ron</PER>’s prefect, not me,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“<PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her jaw dropping.
“No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, blushing harder than ever, “no, it’s not <PER>Ron</PER>’s done loads of <PER>Ron</PER>’s’s really ” The door behind her opened a little wider and Mistress Weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> said the booklists had come at last,” <PER>Ginny</PER> said, glancing around at all the envelopes as <PER>Ginny</PER> made <PER>Ginny</PER>'s way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles.
“His but <PER>Ron</PER>, you’re not ?” <PER>Ron</PER> held up his badge.
“He could if you don’t watch out!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily, at which Fred and George burst out laughing and <PER>Ron</PER> muttered, “Drop it, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “We’re going to have to watch We step, George,” said Fred, pretending to tremble, “with these two on We case” “Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,” said George, shaking George's head.
“Don’t pay any attention to them, <PER>Ron</PER>, they’re only jealous!” “I don’t think they are,” said <PER>Ron</PER> doubtfully, also looking up at the ceiling.
For some reason, <PER>Harry</PER> found that <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to look at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Molly had laid upon it, and crossed the room to <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively.
“Well done,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, so heartily it did not sound like <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice at all, and still not looking at her.
A few moments passed; <PER>Harry</PER> heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds <PER>Harry</PER> could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.
<PER>Harry</PER> straightened up and looked behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> returned slowly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and sank onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe.
<PER>Harry</PER> screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s face and buried it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
Did this make He as arrogant as <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered, anxiously probing <PER>Harry</PER>'s own feelings.
That was definitely true, <PER>Harry</PER> thought; <PER>Harry</PER> was no better than <PER>Ron</PER> in lessons.
What about those adventures he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had had together since they had started at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?
Well, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were with me most of the time, said the voice in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
Not all the time, though, <PER>Harry</PER> argued with <PER>Harry</PER>.
They weren’t in that graveyard with me, the night <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned And the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed <PER>Voldemort</PER> on the night <PER>Voldemort</PER> had arrived rose again.
I’ve done more than either of them\ But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe <PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t choose prefects because they’ve got they into a load of dangerous situations <PER>Dumbledore</PER> chooses them for other reasons <PER>Ron</PER> must have something you don’t <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and stared through <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers at the wardrobe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.
“No one in their right mind would make <PER>Ron</PER> a prefect” <PER>Harry</PER> gave a small snort of laughter.
<PER>Ron</PER> had not asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to give <PER>Dumbledore</PER> the prefect badge.
Was he, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>’s best friend in the world, going to sulk because he didn’t have a badge, laugh with the twins behind <PER>Ron</PER>’s back, ruin this for <PER>Ron</PER> when, for the first time, he had beaten <PER>Harry</PER> at something?
At this point <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER>’s footsteps on the stairs again.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood up, straightened <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses, and hitched a grin onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s face as <PER>Ron</PER> bounded back through the door.
“her says her’ll get the Cleansweep if her can.” “Cool,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER> was relieved to hear that <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice had stopped sounding hearty.
“Listen — <PER>Ron</PER> — well done, mate.” The smile faded off <PER>Ron</PER>’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Ron</PER> kept moving <PER>Harry</PER>'s prefect’s badge around, first placing it on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, then putting it into <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans pocket, then taking it out and laying it on <PER>Harry</PER>'s folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black.
“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,” she told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> as they entered the room.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at <PER>Harry</PER> and moved away toward Sirius and Lupin.
“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at <PER>Ron</PER> with his normal eye, “authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t have appointed you” <PER>Ron</PER> looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s father and eldest brother.
“To <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, the new Gryffindor prefects!” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded.
<PER>Ginny</PER> laughed; <PER>Hermione</PER> looked as though <PER>Ginny</PER> did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it.
“What about you, Sirius?” <PER>Ginny</PER> asked, thumping <PER>Hermione</PER> on the back.
Sirius, who was right beside <PER>Harry</PER>, let out <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual barklike laugh.
All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; <PER>Harry</PER> father loaded up <PER>Harry</PER> father's plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room.
When you think the Comet Two Ninety’s only naught to sixty and that’s with a decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick?” <PER>Hermione</PER> was talking very earnestly to Lupin about <PER>Hermione</PER>'s view of elf rights.
getting really out of hand, and you’re so good- looking, it would look much better shorter, wouldn’t it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Oh — I dunno — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, slightly alarmed at being asked <PER>Harry</PER>'s opinion; <PER>Harry</PER> slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.
Mundungus stopped talking when Mundungus saw <PER>Harry</PER>, but Fred winked and beckoned <PER>Harry</PER> closer.
“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust <PER>Harry</PER>, he’s we financial backer.” “Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding out his hand to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect <PER>Ron</PER>, we’re okay.” “But Moody could have Moody's eye on you,” <PER>Harry</PER> pointed out.
Would Molly still feel that <PER>Harry</PER> was as good as Would Molly's son if she found out <PER>Harry</PER> had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable?
Standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of him's stomach for company, <PER>Harry</PER> caught the sound of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own name.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’ll have had <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s reasons,” replied Lupin.
<PER>Harry</PER> set down <PER>Harry</PER>'s plate and wondered whether <PER>Harry</PER> could follow her without attracting attention.
A small crowd of people, some waving at <PER>Harry</PER>, others lifting others's glasses, looked back up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him, strange bloke That’s Dorcas Meadowes, <PER>Voldemort</PER> killed her personally Sirius, when he still had short hair and there you go, thought that would interest you!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart turned over.
<PER>Harry</PER> mother and father were beaming up at <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man <PER>Harry</PER> recognized at once as Wormtail: <PER>Harry</PER> was the one who had betrayed their whereabouts to <PER>Voldemort</PER> and so helped bring about their deaths.
Evidently Moody’s was under the impression <PER>Harry</PER> had just given <PER>Harry</PER> a bit of a treat.
<PER>Harry</PER> crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call <PER>Harry</PER> back.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know why <PER>Harry</PER> had received such a shock; <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ pictures before, after all, and <PER>Harry</PER> had met Wormtail but to have them sprung on <PER>Harry</PER> like that, when <PER>Harry</PER> was least expecting it No one would like that, He thought angrily And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into madness all waving happily out of the photograph forevermore, not knowing that they were doomed Well, Moody might find that interesting he, <PER>Harry</PER>, found it disturbing <PER>Harry</PER> tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf heads, glad to be on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own again, but as <PER>Harry</PER> approached the first landing <PER>Harry</PER> heard noises.
All the air seemed to vanish from <PER>Harry</PER>’s lungs; he felt as though he were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold — <PER>Ron</PER> dead, no, it couldn’t be But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — <PER>Ron</PER> was downstairs — “Molly?” <PER>Harry</PER> croaked.
Dead <PER>Harry</PER> “Molly, just get out of here!” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>, staring down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own dead body on the floor.
“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about time you got used to hearing it — look, I can’t promise no one’s going to get hurt, nobody can promise that, but we’re much better off than we were last time, you weren’t in the Order then, you don’t understand, last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking we off one by one” <PER>Harry</PER> thought of the photograph again, of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ beaming faces.
“And as for who’s going to look after <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> if you and Arthur died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, “what do you think we’d do, let them starve?” Molly smiled tremulously.
But <PER>Harry</PER>, closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom door behind <PER>Harry</PER> some ten minutes later, could not think Molly silly.
<PER>Harry</PER> could still see <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents beaming up at <PER>Harry</PER> from the tattered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so many of those around their, were drawing to a close.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt older than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever felt in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, and it seemed extraordinary to <PER>Harry</PER> that barely an hour ago <PER>Harry</PER> had been worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge.
<PER>Harry</PER> parents wove in and out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s dreams, never speaking; Mistress Weasley sobbed over Kreacher’s dead body watched by <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were wearing crowns, and yet again <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> walking down a corridor ending in a locked door.
<PER>Harry</PER> awoke abruptly with <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar prickling to find <PER>Ron</PER> already dressed and talking to <PER>Harry</PER>. "
From what he heard as he dressed at top speed, <PER>Harry</PER> gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that them had hurtled straight into <PER>Ginny</PER> and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mistress Black and Molly were both screaming at the top of their voices.
<PER>Hermione</PER> came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as <PER>Harry</PER> was putting on <PER>Harry</PER>'s trainers; Hedwig was swaying on Hedwig's shoulder, and Hedwig was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in Hedwig's arms.
“Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back” — the owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of Hedwig's cage — “are you ready yet?” “Nearly — <PER>Ginny</PER> all right?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, shoving on <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses.
“I thought <PER>Voldemort</PER> was supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in?” “I don’t know, it’s just what Mad-Eye says,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> distractedly, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage, and set off downstairs after <PER>Hermione</PER>, dragging his trunk.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re to come with me and Tonks,” shouted Molly over the repeated screeches of “MUDBLOODSl SCUM CREATURES OF DIRV.” “Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with the luggage Oh, for heaven’s sake, Sirius, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said no!” A bearlike black dog had appeared at <PER>Harry</PER>’s side as <PER>Harry</PER> clambered over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Molly.
<PER>Harry</PER> inhaled the familiar smell and felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s spirits soar <PER>Harry</PER> was really going back “I hope the others make it in time,” said Molly anxiously, staring behind Molly's at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which new arrivals would come.
“Don’t think we were followed” Seconds later, Arthur emerged onto the platform with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
he reached <PER>Harry</PER> last and gave <PER>Harry</PER> a clap on the shoulder.
“Write Be good If you’ve forgotten anything we’ll send it on Onto the train, now, hurry” For one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto the great black dog hind legs and placed the great black dog front paws on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulders, but Molly shoved <PER>Harry</PER> away toward the train door hissing, “For heaven’s sake act more like a dog, Sirius!” “See you!” <PER>Harry</PER> called out of the open window as the train began to move, while <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> waved beside him.
“Shall we go and find a compartment, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged looks.
“We’re — well — <PER>Ron</PER> and I are supposed to go into the prefect carriage,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said awkwardly.
<PER>Ron</PER> wasn’t looking at <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on <PER>Harry</PER>'s left hand.
“Well, I-I might see you later, then.” “Yeah, definitely,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, casting a shifty, anxious look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I know you’re not,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> grinned.
But as <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off toward the engine end of the train, <PER>Harry</PER> felt an odd sense of loss.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Come on,” <PER>Ginny</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, “if we get a move on we’ll be able to save them places.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, picking up Hedwig’s cage in one hand and the handle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk in the other.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at <PER>Harry</PER> with great interest and that several of them nudged them's neighbors and pointed <PER>Harry</PER> out.
In the very last carriage they met <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom, <PER>Harry</PER>’s fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, Trevor.
“Hi, <PER>Ginny</PER> Everywhere ’s full I can’t find a seat” “What are you talking about?” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, who had squeezed past <PER>Neville</PER> to peer into the compartment behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> followed.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew at once why <PER>Neville</PER> had chosen to pass this compartment by.
she eyes ranged over <PER>Neville</PER> and came to rest on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, smiling at <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> stowed the three trunks and Hedwig’s cage in the luggage rack and sat down.
<PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom — Luna Lovegood raised <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom — Luna Lovegood's upside-down magazine high enough to hide <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom — Luna Lovegood's face and fell silent.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> looked at each other with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>'s eyebrows raised.
“Another Remembrall?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, remembering the marblelike device <PER>Neville</PER>’s grandmother had sent <PER>Neville</PER>’s in an effort to improve <PER>Neville</PER>’s's abysmal memory.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time, merely looked as though her was wearing a slimy green hat, but <PER>Harry</PER>, whose hands had been busy preventing the escape of Trevor, received a face full.
“Um bad time?” <PER>Harry</PER> wiped the lenses of <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses with <PER>Harry</PER>'s Trevor- free hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> slumped back in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat and groaned.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have liked <PER>Cho</PER> to discover <PER>Harry</PER> sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke <PER>Harry</PER> had just told; <PER>Harry</PER> would not have chosen to be sitting with <PER>Neville</PER> and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone by.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> had finished <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>'s Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage.
“I’m starving,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog from <PER>Harry</PER> and throwing himself into the seat next to himself.
“Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking thoroughly disgruntled as <PER>Hermione</PER> took <PER>Hermione</PER>'s seat.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>,” replied <PER>Harry</PER> at once, <PER>Harry</PER>'s worst fear confirmed.
“How <PER>Hermione</PER> got to be a prefect when <PER>Hermione</PER>’s thicker than a concussed troll ” “Who’s Hufflepuff?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around at <PER>Ginny</PER> for some kind of explanation, but <PER>Ginny</PER> had stuffed <PER>Ginny</PER>'s knuckles in <PER>Ginny</PER>'s mouth to stop <PER>Ginny</PER> giggling.
“We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,” he told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>, “and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving.
“Yeah, right, because <PER>Malfoy</PER> won’t abuse it at all,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sarcastically.
“So you’re going to descend to his level?” “No, I’m just going to make sure I get his mates before his gets mine.” “For heaven’s sake, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, him hates writing,” said <PER>Ron</PER> happily.
Upside down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was, but <PER>Harry</PER> now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge; <PER>Harry</PER> only recognized <PER>Harry</PER> because of the lime-green bowler hat.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened the magazine and scanned the index; until this moment <PER>Harry</PER> had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed Arthur to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The Quibbler.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to read this sentence several times before <PER>Harry</PER> was convinced that <PER>Harry</PER> had not misunderstood it.
“<PER>Cornelius</PER> ‘Goblin-Crusher’ Fudge, that’s what his friends call his, if you could hear his when his thinks no one’s listening, oh, his’s always talking about the goblins his’s had done in; his’s had them drowned, his’s ’s had them dropped off buildings, his’s had them poisoned, his’s had them cooked in pies” <PER>Harry</PER> did not read any further.
Fudge might have many faults but <PER>Harry</PER> found it extremely hard to imagine <PER>Harry</PER> ordering goblins to be cooked in pies.
“Anything good in there?” asked <PER>Ron</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> closed the magazine.
“Of course not,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> scathingly, before <PER>Harry</PER> could answer, “ The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that.” “Excuse me,” said Luna; Luna's voice had suddenly lost's voice dreamy quality.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around; <PER>Harry</PER> had expected this, but that did not make the sight of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> smirking at <PER>Harry</PER> from between <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s cronies Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable.
“You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.” <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> laughed.
“Shut up, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply.
Sniggering, <PER>Malfoy</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a last malicious look and departed, Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his wake.
<PER>Hermione</PER> slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew at once that <PER>Hermione</PER>, like him, had registered what <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said and been just as unnerved by it.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not talk freely in front of <PER>Neville</PER> and Luna.
<PER>Harry</PER> exchanged another nervous look with <PER>Hermione</PER> and then stared out of the window.
<PER>Harry</PER> had thought Sirius coming with <PER>Harry</PER> to the station was a bit of a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dangerous <PER>Hermione</PER> had been right Sirius should not have come.
What if Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> had noticed the black dog and told <PER>Malfoy</PER>, what if he had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks, and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding?
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting with <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead pressed against the train window, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> pinned their prefect badges carefully to their prefect badges's prefect badges's prefect badges's chests.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> checking how it looked in the black window.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were supposed to supervise all this; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> disappeared from the carriage again, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.
“I’ll carry that owl, if you like,” said Luna to <PER>Harry</PER>, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as <PER>Neville</PER> stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket.
“I don’t know,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, “but we’d better get out of the way, we’re blocking the door.” “Oh yeah ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the station.
Jostled by the crowd, <PER>Harry</PER> squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of <PER>Hagrid</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> had to be here, <PER>Harry</PER> had been relying on it — seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> again had been one of the things to which <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking forward most.
<PER>Harry</PER> can’t have left, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s just got a cold or something <PER>Harry</PER> looked around for <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER>, wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of they was anywhere near him, so him allowed him to be shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade station.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced quickly at the students, turned away to keep a lookout for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, then did a double take.
“Where’s Pig?” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice, right behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That Luna girl was carrying him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, turning quickly, eager to consult <PER>Ron</PER> about <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“He’d better be okay” A short distance away, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, followed by a small gang of cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timid-looking second years out of the way so that they could get a coach to they.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> was being absolutely foul to a first year back there, I swear I’m going to report “<PER>Malfoy</PER>, “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s only had “<PER>Malfoy</PER>'s badge three minutes and “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s using it to bully people worse than ever Where’s Crookshanks?” “<PER>Ginny</PER>’s got him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, relieving <PER>Ginny</PER> of the cat.
“Come on, let’s get a carriage together before they all fillup” “I haven’t got Pig yet!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was already heading off toward the nearest unoccupied coach.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained behind with <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, come on then, let’s get in what were you saying, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “I was saying, what are those horse things?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Luna made for the carriage in which <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> were already sitting.
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, gave <PER>Harry</PER> a perplexed look.
“What are you talking about?” “I’m talking about — look!” <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm and wheeled him about so that him was face-to-face with the winged horse.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you feeling all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “I yeah ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt utterly bewildered.
Yet unless <PER>Ron</PER> was faking — and it was a very feeble joke if he was — <PER>Ron</PER> could not see it at all.
“Shall we get in, then?” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly, looking at <PER>Harry</PER> as though worried about <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yeah, go on ” “It’s all right,” said a dreamy voice from beside <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> vanished into the coach’s dark interior.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to tell the others that <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna were having the same hallucination, if that was what it was, so <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing about the horses as <PER>Harry</PER> sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He isn’t a very good teacher, is He?” “Yes, He is!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> glared at <PER>Hermione</PER>; she cleared shis throat and quickly said, “Erm yes he’s very good.” “Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said Luna, unfazed.
When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds, <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward to try and see whether there were any lights on in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned again to look for lit windows down by the forest, but there was definitely no sign of life within <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
Unwillingly, because <PER>Harry</PER> had half hoped they would have vanished, <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes instead upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air, their blank white eyes gleaming.
<PER>Harry</PER> had once before had the experience of seeing something that <PER>Ron</PER> could not, but that had been a reflection in a mirror, something much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages.
If Luna was to be believed, the beasts had always been there but invisible; why, then, could <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly see the beasts, and why could <PER>Ron</PER> not?
Again <PER>Harry</PER> noticed people putting people's heads together to whisper as <PER>Harry</PER> passed; <PER>Harry</PER> gritted <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth and tried to act as though <PER>Harry</PER> neither noticed nor cared.
The moment they reached Gryffindor’s, <PER>Ginny</PER> was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left to sit with them; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave <PER>Harry</PER> airy, overly friendly greetings that made <PER>Harry</PER> quite sure they had stopped talking about <PER>Harry</PER> a split second before.
<PER>Harry</PER> had more important things to worry about, however: <PER>Harry</PER> was looking over the students’ heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s not there.” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> scanned the staff table too, though there was no real need; <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s size made <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s instantly obvious in any lineup.
“But where is <PER>Harry</PER>, then?” There was a pause, then <PER>Harry</PER> said very quietly, so that <PER>Neville</PER>, Parvati, and Lavender could not hear, “Maybe <PER>Harry</PER>’s not back yet.
“It’s that <PER>Umbridge</PER> woman!” “Who?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> was at my hearing, <PER>Hermione</PER> works for Fudge!” “Nice cardigan,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, smirking.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> works for Fudge?” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated, frowning.
“What on earth’s she doing here, then?” “Dunno ” <PER>Hermione</PER> scanned the staff table, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes narrowed.
“No,” she muttered, “no, surely not ” <PER>Harry</PER> did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask; <PER>Harry</PER>'s attention had just been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked shis way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> recalled, fleetingly, how terrified <PER>Harry</PER> had felt when <PER>Harry</PER> had stood there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which House <PER>Harry</PER> belonged.
“Yes, indeed,” said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning across <PER>Neville</PER> toward Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably's (<PER>Neville</PER> winced, it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you).
With a last frowning look that swept the four House tables, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> lowered Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyes to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s long piece of parchment and called out, “Abercrombie, Euan.” The terrified-looking boy <PER>Harry</PER> had noticed earlier stumbled forward and put the hat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s head; it was only prevented from falling right down to The terrified-looking boy <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders by The terrified-looking boy <PER>Harry</PER>'s very prominent ears.
Slowly the long line of first years thinned; in the pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat’s decisions, <PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Ron</PER>’s stomach rumbling loudly.
Finally, “Zeller, Rose” was sorted into Hufflepuff, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> picked up the hat and stool and marched them away as Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> rose to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> was somehow soothed to see Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> standing before them all, whatever Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s recent bitter feelings toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s headmaster.
Between the absence of <PER>Hagrid</PER> and the presence of those dragonish horses, <PER>Harry</PER> had felt that <PER>Harry</PER>'s return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song.
His mouth was so full <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was quite an achievement for <PER>Harry</PER> to make any noise at all.
“Of course, it lives in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office, so I daresay it picks things up there.” “And it wants all the Houses to be friends?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking over at the Slytherin table, where <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was holding court.
“Well done, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile their; <PER>Harry</PER> felt it was a better use of <PER>Harry</PER>'s time to eat <PER>Harry</PER>'s way steadily through <PER>Harry</PER>'s steak-and- kidney pie, then a large plateful of <PER>Harry</PER>'s favorite treacle tart.
When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the hall was starting to creep upward again, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet once more.
<PER>Harry</PER> four-poster bed was waiting somewhere above, wonderfully warm and soft “Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“First years ought to know that the forest in the grounds is out of bounds to students — and a few of our older students ought to know by now too.” (<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged smirks.)
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> continued, “Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams will take place on the — ” He broke off, looking inquiringly at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
As she was not much taller standing than sitting, there was a moment when nobody understood why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had stopped talking, but then Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> said, “Hem, hem,” and it became clear that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had got to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s feet and was intending to make a speech.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> only looked taken aback for a moment, then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat back down smartly and looked alertly at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> desired nothing better than to listen to shis talk.
Professor Sprout’s eyebrows had disappeared into Professor Sprout's flyaway hair, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s mouth was as thin as <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen it.
“Thank you, Headmaster,” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> simpered, “for those kind words of welcome.” Her voice was high-pitched, breathy, and little-girlish and again, <PER>Harry</PER> felt a powerful rush of dislike that <PER>Harry</PER> could not explain to <PER>Harry</PER>; all <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that <PER>Harry</PER> loathed everything about her, from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike, and <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly saw shis exchange a significant glance with Professor Sprout as <PER>Umbridge</PER> gave another little “Hem, hem” and went on with shis speech.
Over at the Ravenclaw table, <PER>Cho</PER> Chang was chatting animatedly with <PER>Cho</PER> Chang's friends.
Meanwhile at the Hufflepuff table, Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still staring at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, but Ernie Macmillan was glassy-eyed and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure Ernie Macmillan was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefect’s badge gleaming on Ernie Macmillan's chest.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> did not seem to notice the restlessness of Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s audience.
The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be drinking in every word <PER>Umbridge</PER> spoke, though judging by <PER>Hermione</PER>'s expression, they were not at all to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s taste. "
The staff followed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s lead, though <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that several of them brought them's hands together only once or twice before stopping.
“Thank you very much, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, that was most illuminating,” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> said, bowing to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“You’re not telling me you enjoyed it?” <PER>Ron</PER> said quietly, turning a glazed face upon <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, we’re supposed to show the first years where to go!” “Oh yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had obviously forgotten.
them did indeed seem very small; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> had not appeared that young when <PER>Harry</PER> had arrived here.
“See you later,” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and he made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more whispering, staring, and pointing as he passed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I know it!” someone panted from behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> turned to see <PER>Neville</PER> jogging toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mimbulus mimbletonio 1” “Correct,” said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung open toward them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through which <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> now climbed.
<PER>Harry</PER> waved good night to Fred and George Weasley and headed straight for the door to the boys’ dormitories; <PER>Harry</PER> was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment.
They had been talking as <PER>Harry</PER> pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment They saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether they had been talking about <PER>Harry</PER>, then whether <PER>Harry</PER> was being paranoid.
“Hi,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, moving across to <PER>Harry</PER>'s own trunk and opening it.
“Good holiday?” “Not bad,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, as a true account of <PER>Harry</PER>'s holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and <PER>Harry</PER> could not face it.
Then he said, with his back still turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, “Me mam didn’t want me to come back.” “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pausing in the act of pulling off <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt vaguely as though something was closing in on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes, “she er well, it’s not just you, it’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> too ” “She believes the Daily Prophet?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand down onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, stuffed them angrily into <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk, and pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas.
Dean, who had been bending over his trunk, trying to retrieve a slipper, went oddly still and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was listening hard.
“Don’t talk to me like that!” “I’ll talk to you how I want,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper rising so fast <PER>Harry</PER> snatched <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back from <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table.
“If you’ve got a problem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask <PER>McGonagall</PER> if you can be moved, stop your mummy worrying — ” “Leave my mother out of this, Potter!” “What’s going on?” <PER>Ron</PER> had appeared in the doorway.
“<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t do that — we met your mother, we liked your mother” “That’s before she started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me!” said <PER>Harry</PER> at the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
“You believe all the rubbish he’s come out with about <PER>Voldemort</PER>, do you, you reckon he’s telling the truth?” “Yeah, I do!” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
<PER>Ron</PER> glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> said aggressively.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillows while <PER>Ron</PER> bustled around the next bed, putting <PER>Harry</PER>'s things away.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt shaken by the argument with Seamus, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had always liked very much.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown <PER>Dumbledore</PER> from the International Confederation of Wizards's ranks?
Was it anger at <PER>Harry</PER>, perhaps, that had stopped <PER>Dumbledore</PER> getting in touch with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for months?
The two of them were in this together, after all; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had believed <PER>Harry</PER>, announced <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s version of events to the whole school and then to the wider Wizarding community.
Anyone who thought <PER>Harry</PER> was a liar had to think that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was too or else that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been hoodwinked They’ll know we’re right in the end, thought <PER>Harry</PER> miserably, as <PER>Ron</PER> got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory.
But <PER>Harry</PER> wondered how many attacks like Seamus’s <PER>Harry</PER> would have to endure before that time came.
Seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before <PER>Harry</PER> had even put on <PER>Harry</PER>'s socks.
“Does <PER>Harry</PER> think hell turn into a nutter if <PER>Harry</PER> stays in a room with me too long?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, as the hem of Seamus’s robes whipped out of sight.
<PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both gave <PER>Harry</PER> it’s-his-problem-not- yours looks, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not much consoled.
“What’s the matter?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> five minutes later, catching up with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> halfway across the common room as they all headed toward breakfast.
“We’ll have to talk to them, <PER>Ron</PER>.” <PER>Ron</PER> looked positively alarmed.
“It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!” <PER>Ron</PER> said nothing; <PER>Harry</PER> could tell from <PER>Harry</PER>'s glum expression that the prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they liked was not one that <PER>Harry</PER> found inviting.
“Anyway, what’s up, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> continued, as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards, all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in them's own conversation.
“You look really angry about something.” “Seamus reckons <PER>Harry</PER>’s lying about You-Know- Who,” said <PER>Ron</PER> succinctly, when <PER>Harry</PER> did not respond.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had expected to react angrily on his behalf, sighed.
“No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> calmly, “I told <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to keep <PER>Hermione</PER>'s big fat mouth shut about you, actually.
“Don’t you remember what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said at the end-of-term feast last year?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both looked at her blankly, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sighed again.
“I listen, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a touch of asperity.
“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what — ” “The point,” <PER>Hermione</PER> pressed on loudly, “is that this sort of thing is exactly what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was talking about.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman’s staying,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor table.
“What?” said both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
“Well maybe he didn’t want to draw attention to <PER>Hagrid</PER> not being here.” “What d’you mean, draw attention to it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, half laughing.
“How could we not notice?” Before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer, a tall black girl with long, braided hair had marched up to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Hi, Angelina.” “Hi,” Angelina said briskly, “good summer?” And without waiting for an answer, “Listen, I’ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.” “Nice one,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning at her; <PER>Harry</PER> suspected Angelina’s pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood’s had been, which could only be an improvement.
“I’d forgotten Wood had left,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely, sitting down beside <PER>Ron</PER> and pulling a plate of toast toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> was a good Keeper” “Still, it won’t hurt to have some new blood, will it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Hedwig was nowhere to be seen, but <PER>Harry</PER> was hardly surprised; <PER>Harry</PER>'s only correspondent was Sirius, and <PER>Harry</PER> doubted Sirius would have anything new to tell <PER>Harry</PER> after only twenty-four hours apart.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, had to move <PER>Hermione</PER>] orange juice aside quickly to make way for a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak.
“What are you still getting that for?” said <PER>Harry</PER> irritably, thinking of Seamus, as <PER>Hermione</PER> placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl’s leg and it took off again.
“I’m not bothering load of rubbish.” “It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> darkly, and <PER>Hermione</PER> unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind the newspaper, not emerging until <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had finished eating.
“Nothing about you or <PER>Dumbledore</PER> or anything.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was now moving along the table handing out schedules.
“History of Magic, double Potions, Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts Binns, <PER>Snape</PER>, Trelawney, and that <PER>Umbridge</PER> woman all in one day!
“Cheers,” said <PER>Ron</PER> moodily, pocketing his schedule, “but I think I’ll take the lessons.” “And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, eyeing Fred and George beadily, “you can’t advertise for testers on the Gryffindor notice board.” “Says who?” said George, looking astonished.
“And <PER>Ron</PER>.” “Leave me out of it,” said <PER>Ron</PER> hastily.
<PER>Harry</PER> face felt hot; <PER>Harry</PER> deliberately dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s fork and dived down to retrieve ] fork.
“What did that mean?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying <PER>Hermione</PER>’s notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns ’s voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain disengaged, and <PER>Harry</PER> spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parchment with <PER>Ron</PER>, while <PER>Hermione</PER> shot them filthy looks out of the corner of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eye.
“How would it be,” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked them coldly as them left the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), “if I refused to lend you my notes this year?” “We’d fail our O.W.L.s,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“We just haven’t got your brains or your memory or your concentration — you’re just cleverer than We are — is it nice to rub it in?” “Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> looked slightly mollified as <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way out into the damp courtyard.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what <PER>Snape</PER> was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner toward them.
“Hello, <PER>Harry</PER>!” It was <PER>Cho</PER> Chang and what was more, <PER>Cho</PER> Chang was on <PER>Cho</PER> Chang's own again.
This was most unusual: <PER>Cho</PER> was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; <PER>Harry</PER> remembered the agony of trying to get <PER>Cho</PER>'s by <PER>Cho</PER> to ask <PER>Cho</PER>'s to the Yule Ball.
“Hi,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, feeling <PER>Harry</PER>'s face grow hot.
“So did you er have a good summer?” The moment he had said this he wished he hadn’t: Cedric had been <PER>Cho</PER>’s boyfriend and the memory of Cedric's death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected <PER>Harry</PER>’s Something seemed to tauten in her face, but her said, “Oh, it was all right, you know” “Is that a Tornados badge?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded suddenly, pointing at the front of <PER>Cho</PER>’s robes, to which a sky- blue badge emblazoned with a double gold T was pinned.
“Have you always supported them, or just since them started winning the league?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, in what <PER>Harry</PER> considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice.
“Anyway see you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Cho</PER> walked away.
<PER>Hermione</PER> waited until <PER>Cho</PER> was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on <PER>Ron</PER>.
They did not stop arguing all the way down to <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, which gave <PER>Harry</PER> plenty of time to reflect that between <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> he would be lucky ever to have two minutes’ conversation with <PER>Cho</PER> that <PER>Cho</PER> could look back on without wanting to leave the country.
And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside <PER>Snape</PER>’s classroom door, <PER>Snape</PER> had chosen to come and talk to <PER>Snape</PER>, hadn’t <PER>Snape</PER>?
She had been Cedric’s girlfriend; She could easily have hated <PER>Harry</PER> for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet She was talking to <PER>Harry</PER> in a perfectly friendly way, not as though She thought <PER>Harry</PER> mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric’s death Yes, She had definitely chosen to come and talk to <PER>Harry</PER>, and that made the second time in two days and at this thought, <PER>Harry</PER>’s spirits rose.
Even the ominous sound of <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in <PER>Snape</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Snape</PER> filed into the classroom behind <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and followed them to them's usual table at the back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them.
“Settle down,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, shutting the door behind <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glared back, feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to give up Potions after fifth year.
“The ingredients and method” — <PER>Snape</PER> flicked — <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand — “are on the blackboard” — (they appeared there) — “you will find everything you need” — he flicked his wand again — “in the store cupboard” — (the door of the said cupboard sprang open) — “you have an hour and a half Start.” Just as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had predicted, — <PER>Snape</PER> could hardly have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion.
The surface of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s potion, however, was a shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as <PER>Snape</PER> swept by <PER>Snape</PER> looked down <PER>Snape</PER>'s hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that <PER>Snape</PER> could find nothing to criticize.
At <PER>Harry</PER>’s cauldron, however, <PER>Snape</PER> stopped, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER> with a horrible smirk on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Potter, what is this supposed to be?” The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they loved hearing <PER>Snape</PER> taunt <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Tell me, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> softly, “can you read?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> laughed.
“Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.” While everyone around him filled their flagons, <PER>Harry</PER> cleared away <PER>Harry</PER>'s things, seething.
<PER>Harry</PER> potion had been no worse than <PER>Ron</PER>’s, which was now giving off a foul odor of bad eggs, or <PER>Neville</PER>’s, which had achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which <PER>Neville</PER> was now having to gouge out of his cauldron, yet it was he, <PER>Harry</PER>, who would be receiving zero marks for the day’s work.
When at long last the bell rang, <PER>Harry</PER> was first out of the dungeon and had already started <PER>Harry</PER>'s lunch by the time <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined <PER>Harry</PER> in the Great Hall.
“That was really unfair,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> consolingly, sitting down next to <PER>Harry</PER> and helping <PER>Hermione</PER> to shepherd’s pie.
“Your potion wasn’t nearly as bad as Goyle’s, when Your potion put Your potion in Your potion's flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire.” “Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glowering at <PER>Harry</PER>'s plate, “since when has <PER>Snape</PER> ever been fair to me?” Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>’s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had set foot in Hogwarts.
“Anyway, I’ve always thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was cracked trusting <PER>Snape</PER>, where’s the evidence <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ever really stopped working for <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” “I think <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s probably got plenty of evidence, even if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t share it with you, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> heavily, as <PER>Ron</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to argue back.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both froze, looking angry and offended.
The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside He, and the vision of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shocked faces afforded He a sense of deep satisfaction.
“Come back, you scurvy dog, stand fast and fight!” yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from behind Sir Cadogan's visor, but <PER>Harry</PER> merely walked on, and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow Sir Cadogan by running into a neighboring picture, <PER>Harry</PER> was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and angry-looking wolfhound.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of North Tower, and consequently <PER>Harry</PER> was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sibyll Trelawney’s classroom when the bell rang.
she was busy putting copies of battered, leather-bound books on each of the spindly little tables with which shis room was littered when <PER>Harry</PER> entered the room, but so dim was the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the low-burning, sickly-scented fire that she appeared not to notice <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> took a seat in the shadows.
<PER>Ron</PER> emerged from the trapdoor, looked around carefully, spotted <PER>Harry</PER> and made directly for <PER>Harry</PER>, or as directly as <PER>Harry</PER> could while having to wend <PER>Harry</PER>'s way between tables, chairs, and overstuffed poufs.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> and me have stopped arguing,” he said, sitting down beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Hermione</PER> says <PER>Hermione</PER> thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
At the table next to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, Dean had paired up with <PER>Neville</PER>, who immediately embarked on a long- winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother’s best hat; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> merely looked at each other glumly.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not going to share <PER>Harry</PER>'s dreams with anyone.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well what <PER>Harry</PER>'s regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, <PER>Harry</PER> did not need <PER>Ron</PER> or Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him that “Well, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the other night,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, screwing up his face in an effort to remember.
When the bell went, he and <PER>Ron</PER> led the way back down the ladder, <PER>Ron</PER> grumbling loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> shoved <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and pulled out quill, ink, and parchment.
“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t your teaching in this subject?” stated Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, turning to face the class with Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s hands clasped neatly in front of Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
When everyone had copied down Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s three course aims Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> said, “Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?” There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.
“When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply ‘Yes, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>,’ or ‘No, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.’ So, has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?” “Yes, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>,” rang through the room.
“I should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be no need to talk.” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> left the blackboard and settled ” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> in the chair behind the teacher’s desk, observing them all with those pouchy toad’s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to page five of <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked right and received a surprise to shake <PER>Harry</PER> out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s torpor.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had not even opened <PER>Hermione</PER>'s copy of Defensive Magical Theory.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was staring fixedly at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand in the air.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not remember <PER>Hermione</PER> ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s questioningly, but <PER>Hermione</PER> merely shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head slightly to indicate that <PER>Hermione</PER> was not about to answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction.
After several more minutes had passed, however, <PER>Harry</PER> was not the only one watching <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch <PER>Hermione</PER>’s mute attempt to catch Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s eye than to struggle on with “Basics for Beginners.” When more than half the class were staring at <PER>Hermione</PER> rather than at their books, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> seemed to decide that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> could ignore the situation no longer.
“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” she asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had only just noticed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And your name is — ?” “<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> immediately raised their hands too.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s pouchy eyes lingered on <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment before she addressed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?” “Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?” asked Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> in Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s falsely sweet voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> thrust <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist in the air.
“If we’re going to be attacked, it won’t be risk-free — ” “I repeat,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, “do you expect to be attacked during my classes?” “No, but — ” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> talked over him.
“Are you telling us that the first time us’ll get to do the spells will be during our exam?” “I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough — ” “And what good’s theory going to be in the real world?” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist in the air again.
“Hmm, let’s think ” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a mock thoughtful voice, “maybe Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; <PER>Neville</PER> slipped sideways off <PER>Neville</PER>'s stool.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was staring at <PER>Harry</PER> with a grimly satisfied expression on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s face.
Everyone was staring at either <PER>Umbridge</PER> or <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> stood up and leaned toward them, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s stubby-fingered hands splayed on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s desk.
“You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead — ” “He wasn’t dead,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, “but yeah, He’s returned!” “Mister-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten- points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> in one breath without looking at him.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his sleeve, but <PER>Harry</PER> jerked his arm out of her reach.
“So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of Cedric Diggory's own accord, did Cedric Diggory?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice shaking.
There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, had ever heard <PER>Harry</PER> talk about what had happened on the night that Cedric had died.
They stared avidly from <PER>Harry</PER> to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> killed him, and you know it.” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s face was quite blank.
Then she said, in shis softest, most sweetly girlish voice, “Come here, Potter, dear.” he kicked his chair aside, strode around <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and up to the teacher’s desk.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s quill into a bottle of ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that <PER>Harry</PER> could not see what Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was writing.
“Take this to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, dear,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, holding out the note to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
He took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not even looking back at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and slamming the classroom door shut behind <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Get out of it, Peeves.” “Oooh, Crackpot’s feeling cranky,” said Peeves, pursuing <PER>Harry</PER> along the corridor, leering as <PER>Harry</PER> zoomed along above <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Is this true?” “Is what true?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, rather more aggressively than <PER>Harry</PER> had intended.
“Is it true that you shouted at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You called her a liar?” “Yes.” “You told her <PER>Voldemort</PER> is back?” “Yes.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> sat down behind her desk, frowning at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And sit down.” There had been a previous occasion when <PER>Harry</PER>, expecting to be caned by Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, had instead been appointed by her to the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> set down Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s note and looked very seriously at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Potter, you need to be careful.” <PER>Harry</PER> swallowed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at Ginger Newt.
“Misbehavior in Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s class could cost you much more than House points and a detention.” “What do you — ?” “Potter, use your common sense,” snapped Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, with an abrupt return to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s usual manner.
“It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said, looking down at <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s note again.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back, you know he is, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knows he is — ” “For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, straightening her glasses angrily (her had winced horribly when he had used <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name).
“Didn’t you listen to Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I’m glad you listen to <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger at any rate,” <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger said, pointing <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger out of <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger's office.
The news about <PER>Harry</PER>'s shouting match with <PER>Umbridge</PER> seemed to have traveled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts standards.
He heard whispers all around him as him sat eating between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“he says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered” “he reckons he dueled with <PER>Voldemort</PER>” “Come off it” “Who does he think he’s kidding?” “Pur - lease ” “What I don’t get,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a shaking voice, laying down <PER>Harry</PER>'s knife and fork (<PER>Harry</PER> hands were trembling too much to hold them steady), “is why they all believed the story two months ago when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told them” “The thing is, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m not sure they did,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly.
“Oh, let’s get out of here.” <PER>Hermione</PER> slammed down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own knife and fork; <PER>Ron</PER> looked sadly at his half-finished apple pie but followed suit.
“What d’you mean, you’re not sure they believed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> when they reached the first-floor landing.
“You arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedric’s dead body None of us saw what happened in the maze We just had <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s word for it that You-Know- Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought you.” “Which is the truth!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly.
“I know it is, <PER>Harry</PER>, so will you please stop biting my head off?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> wearily.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s first day had lasted a week, but <PER>Harry</PER> still had a mountain of homework to do before bed.
Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took them's three favorite chairs at the fireside himself leapt lightly into <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion.
“How can <PER>Dumbledore</PER> have let this happen?” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried suddenly, making <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted.
“Don’t start arguing again,” said <PER>Harry</PER> wearily, as <PER>Ron</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to retaliate.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s face averted from the portrait hole, but could still sense the stares <PER>Harry</PER> was attracting.
“Shall we do <PER>Snape</PER>’s stuff first?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, dipping his quill into his ink.
“So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making?” But <PER>Hermione</PER> was not listening; <PER>Hermione</PER> was squinting over into the far corner of the room, where Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the center of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding.
“Come on, <PER>Ron</PER>.” “I — what?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, plainly playing for time.
“No — come on, <PER>Hermione</PER> — we can’t tell them off for giving out sweets” “You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or — or Puking Pastilles or — ” “Fainting Fancies?” <PER>Harry</PER> suggested quietly.
Most of the people watching were laughing; <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, squared <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first years.
<PER>Ron</PER> rose halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, “She’s got it under control,” before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted.
<PER>Hermione</PER> drew <PER>Hermione</PER> up to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s full height; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes were narrowed and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity.
With a last threatening look at them, <PER>Hermione</PER> thrust Fred’s clipboard and the bag of Fancies back into his arms and stalked back to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s chair by the fire.
“Thank you for your support, <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said acidly.
“And you’re covering them up with rubbish first?” “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> defiantly, swinging <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag onto <PER>Hermione</PER>'s back.
“There’s no point trying to finish this now, I can’t do it without <PER>Hermione</PER>, I haven’t got a clue what you’re supposed to do with moonstones, have you?” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, noticing as <PER>Harry</PER> did so that the ache in <PER>Harry</PER>'s right temple was getting worse.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation.
“But on the plus side, no <PER>Snape</PER> today,” said <PER>Ron</PER> bracingly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> yawned widely and poured <PER>Hermione</PER> some coffee.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked mildly pleased about something, and when <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s what <PER>Hermione</PER> had to be so happy about, <PER>Hermione</PER> simply said, “The hats have gone.
Professor Flitwick and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> both spent the first fifteen minutes of Professor Flitwick and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> both's lessons lecturing the class on the importance of O.W.L.s.
By the end of a double period, neither he nor <PER>Ron</PER> had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practicing, though <PER>Ron</PER> said hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, on the other hand, successfully vanished <PER>Hermione</PER>'s snail on the third attempt, earning <PER>Hermione</PER>'s a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion-making.
Still angry about <PER>Ron</PER>’s slur on her woolly hats, <PER>Hermione</PER> did not join woolly hats.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them; turning, them saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> striding toward them, surrounded by <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s usual gang of Slytherin cronies.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table.
“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating <PER>Harry</PER>: Anyone would have thought that <PER>Hagrid</PER> never showed them impressive creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so.
<PER>Harry</PER> deliberately circled around the back so that <PER>Harry</PER> ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-Plank.
“Where’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” ’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>?
Smirking all over his pointed face, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> leaned across <PER>Harry</PER> and seized the largest bowtruckle.
“Maybe,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> in an undertone, so that only <PER>Harry</PER> could hear him, “the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.” “Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” said <PER>Harry</PER> out of the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
“Maybe himself’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for himself, if you get my drift.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> walked away, smirking over his shoulder at <PER>Harry</PER>, who suddenly felt sick.
His hurried back around the table to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough to draw it.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out parchment and quill, crouched down beside the others, and related in a whisper what <PER>Malfoy</PER> had just said.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would know if something had happened to <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped it; Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of <PER>Hagrid</PER> being sacked, laughed still harder as the bowtruckle set off at full tilt toward the forest, a little, moving stickman soon swallowed up by the tree roots.
When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds <PER>Harry</PER> rolled up <PER>Harry</PER>'s bloodstained bowtruckle picture and marched off to Herbology with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand wrapped in a handkerchief of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s and <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s derisive laughter still ringing in his ears.
“If his calls <PER>Hagrid</PER> a moron one more time ” snarled <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, don’t go picking a row with <PER>Malfoy</PER>, don’t forget, <PER>Harry</PER>’s a prefect now, <PER>Harry</PER> could make life difficult for you” “Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult life?” said <PER>Harry</PER> sarcastically.
<PER>Ron</PER> laughed, but <PER>Hermione</PER> frowned.
“I just wish <PER>Hagrid</PER> would hurry up and get back, that’s all,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses.
“Because <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll never be as good as <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, fully aware that <PER>Harry</PER> had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.
When she saw <PER>Harry</PER>, shis prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for <PER>Harry</PER>.
“D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> as they made their way into class.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, <PER>Harry</PER>, you can do better than her,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>’s told me all about <PER>Ginny</PER>, apparently her’ll only believe in things as long as there’s no proof at all.
Ernie’s words had certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Brown’s face and, as he turned to talk to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> caught Seamus’s expression, which looked both confused and defiant.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished all the teachers would stop doing this; <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to get an anxious, twisted feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach every time <PER>Harry</PER> remembered how much homework <PER>Harry</PER> had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class.
As <PER>Harry</PER> was starving, and <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s first detention with <PER>Umbridge</PER> at five o’clock, <PER>Harry</PER> headed straight for dinner without dropping off <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag in Gryffindor Tower so that <PER>Harry</PER> could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had barely reached the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice said, “Oy, Potter!” “What now?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she was in a towering temper.
“I’ll tell you what now,” she said, marching straight up to <PER>Harry</PER> and poking <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the chest with shis finger.
“I got detention from that <PER>Umbridge</PER> woman, just because I told her the truth about <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on Friday,” said Angelina fiercely, “and I don’t care how you do it, tell her <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s a figment of your imagination if you like, just make sure you’re therel” her stormed away.
“You know what?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they entered the Great Hall.
“I think we’d better check with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Wood’s been killed during a training session, because she seems to be channeling his spirit.” “What d’you reckon are the odds of <PER>Umbridge</PER> letting you off on Friday?” said <PER>Ron</PER> skeptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.
“And it looks like it’s going to rain.” “What’s that got to do with our homework?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyebrows raised.
At five to five <PER>Harry</PER> bade the other two good-bye and set off for <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office on the third floor.
These were so foul that <PER>Harry</PER> stared at them, transfixed, until Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> spoke again.
With a massive effort <PER>Harry</PER> looked away from She, dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s schoolbag beside the straight-backed chair, and sat down.
At the same time, The words had appeared on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s right hand, cut into <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin as though traced there by a scalpel — yet even as <PER>Harry</PER> stared at the shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin, once again they healed over seconds later.
Again and again <PER>Harry</PER> wrote the words on the parchment in what <PER>Harry</PER> soon came to realize was not ink, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s own blood.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not ask when <PER>Harry</PER> would be allowed to stop.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not even check <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew she was watching <PER>Harry</PER> for signs of weakness and <PER>Harry</PER> was not going to show any, not even if <PER>Harry</PER> had to sit here all night, cutting open <PER>Harry</PER>'s own hand with this quill “Come here,” she said, after what seemed hours.
When <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at it <PER>Harry</PER> saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was red raw.
<PER>Harry</PER> repressed a shudder as she touched <PER>Harry</PER> with shis thick, stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings.
He skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled <PER>Ron</PER> keeping a disheveled <PER>Ron</PER> company.
“How come you didn’t do it last night?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, as <PER>Ron</PER> stared wildly around the common room for inspiration.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who had been fast asleep when <PER>Harry</PER> got back to the dormitory, muttered something about “doing other stuff,” bent low over <PER>Harry</PER>'s parchment, and scrawled a few words.
It was another bad day for <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to give up <PER>Harry</PER>'s lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and meanwhile, Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which <PER>Harry</PER> had no prospect of finishing that evening because of <PER>Harry</PER>'s second detention with <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“D’you think I’d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?” “At least it’s only lines,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> consolingly, as <PER>Harry</PER> sank back onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bench and looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s steak-and-kidney pie, which <PER>Harry</PER> no longer fancied very much.
“It’s not as if it’s a dreadful punishment, really” <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, closed ] mouth again, and nodded.
He was not really sure why He was not telling <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exactly what was happening in <PER>Umbridge</PER> ’s room: He only knew that He did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct impression that <PER>Harry</PER> was not alone in concealing things at the moment.
The skin on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand became irritated more quickly now, red and inflamed; <PER>Harry</PER> thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for long.
Soon the cut would remain etched in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and <PER>Umbridge</PER> would, perhaps, be satisfied.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed very sleepy too, though <PER>Harry</PER> could not see why <PER>Harry</PER> should be.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s third detention passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two hours the words “I must not tell lies” did not fade from the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood.
She’s evil, He thought, as He climbed a staircase to the seventh floor, She’s an evil, twisted, mad, old — “<PER>Ron</PER>?” He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, and almost walked into <PER>Ron</PER>, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his broomstick.
He gave a great leap of surprise when He saw <PER>Harry</PER> and attempted to hide He's new Cleansweep Eleven behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
“Yeah, so do — <PER>Harry</PER>, what’s that on the back of your hand?” <PER>Harry</PER>, who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand, tried to hide it, but had as much success as <PER>Ron</PER> with his Cleans weep.
“It’s just a cut — it’s nothing — it’s — ” But <PER>Ron</PER> had grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s forearm and pulled the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand up level with <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
“I thought you said she was giving you lines?” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, but after all, <PER>Ron</PER> had been honest with <PER>Harry</PER>, so <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> the truth about the hours <PER>Harry</PER> had been spending in <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, then, tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> flatly.
“Why not?” “<PER>Harry</PER>’s got enough on <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but that was not the true reason.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not going to go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for help when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not spoken to <PER>Harry</PER> once since last June.
“Well, I reckon you should — ” <PER>Ron</PER> began, but <PER>Harry</PER> was interrupted by the Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out, “Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?” Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> glanced toward the staff table automatically when <PER>Harry</PER> entered the Great Hall, it was without real hope of seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind immediately to <PER>Harry</PER>'s more pressing problems, such as the mountainous pile of homework <PER>Harry</PER> had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention with <PER>Umbridge</PER> was sure to be, his had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of <PER>Ron</PER>’s tryout.
These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but <PER>Harry</PER> was grateful for anything that might lighten <PER>Harry</PER>'s present darkness; <PER>Harry</PER> had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts.
At five o’clock that evening <PER>Harry</PER> knocked on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office door for what <PER>Harry</PER> sincerely hoped would be the final time, was told to enter and did so.
“You know what to do, Potter,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, smiling sweetly over at <PER>Harry</PER>.
If <PER>Harry</PER> just shifted <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair an inch or so to the right On the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table himself managed it.
The sky was darkening so that <PER>Harry</PER> doubted <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to watch the sixth and seventh people at all.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was dozing in it, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s drink tipping precariously in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
“Well, <PER>Hermione</PER> said <PER>Hermione</PER> was pleased when I told <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking slightly put out.
“We can take off his name and put yours on instead” As <PER>Ron</PER> moved away, Angelina came striding up to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved over to sit next to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who awoke with a jerk as <PER>Harry</PER> put down <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s you Good about <PER>Ron</PER>, isn’t it?” she said blearily.
“Great,” said <PER>Harry</PER> distractedly; if <PER>Harry</PER> did not tell somebody soon, <PER>Harry</PER> would burst.
“Listen, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I was just up in <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office and <PER>Hermione</PER> touched my arm ” <PER>Hermione</PER> listened closely.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished <PER>Hermione</PER> said slowly, “You’re worried that You-Know- Who’s controlling shis like he controlled <PER>Quirrell</PER>?” “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, dropping <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice, “it’s a possibility, isn’t it?” “I suppose so,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> sounded unconvinced.
“But I don’t think he can be possessing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s the way he possessed <PER>Quirrell</PER>, I mean, he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own body, he wouldn’t need to share someone else’s.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> say it had to do with what You- Know- Who was feeling at the time?
“Twisted.” “She’s horrible, yes, but <PER>Harry</PER>, I think you ought to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> your scar hurt.” It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and his answer to <PER>Hermione</PER> was just the same as his answer to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was the first to awake in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory next morning.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the chink of sunlight falling through the gap in <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster’s hangings and savored the thought that it was Saturday.
Making straight for his favorite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, <PER>Harry</PER> settled <PER>Harry</PER> down comfortably and unrolled <PER>Harry</PER>'s parchment while looking around the room.
Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether how many elves wanted to be or not, <PER>Harry</PER> uncorked <PER>Harry</PER>'s ink bottle, dipped <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill into it, and then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parchment, thinking hard But after a minute or so <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say.
<PER>Harry</PER> could now appreciate how hard it had been for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to write <PER>Harry</PER> letters over the summer.
How was <PER>Harry</PER> supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions <PER>Harry</PER> was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information <PER>Harry</PER> did not want them to have?
<PER>Harry</PER> sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, <PER>Harry</PER> dipped <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill into the ink bottle once more and set the ink bottle resolutely upon the parchment.
Best, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> reread this letter several times, trying to see this letter from the point of view of an outsider.
<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> could not see how they would know what <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was talking about — or who <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was talking to — just from reading this letter.
<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about <PER>Hagrid</PER> and tell them when <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> might be back: <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what <PER>Hagrid</PER> might be up to while <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was not at Hogwarts.
She had the unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to Shis boss, yet <PER>Harry</PER> could not see why; <PER>Harry</PER> was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning.
The sun was high in the sky now and when <PER>Harry</PER> entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting.
“Safe flight, then,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> carried her to one of the windows; with a moment’s pressure on his arm Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched them, savoring the fresh air on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, thinking about Quidditch later and then <PER>Harry</PER> saw it.
The whole thing had happened so quickly <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, except that <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was hammering madly.
him leapt in shock, and turning quickly, saw <PER>Cho</PER> Chang holding a letter and a parcel in <PER>Cho</PER> Chang's hands.
<PER>Cho</PER> coaxed it down onto <PER>Cho</PER>'s arm where it held out an obliging leg so that <PER>Cho</PER> could attach the parcel.
“It’s my friend <PER>Ron</PER> Weasley, d’you know him?” “The Tornado-hater?” said <PER>Cho</PER> rather coolly.
“That <PER>Umbridge</PER> woman’s foul,” That <PER>Umbridge</PER> woman said in a low voice.
Who cared about a stupid flying horse, <PER>Cho</PER> thought <PER>Cho</PER> had been really brave For a moment <PER>Cho</PER> considered accidentally-on-purpose showing <PER>Cho</PER>'s his cut hand as his helped her tie her parcel onto her owl But the very instant that this thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened again.
“I’ve had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!” <PER>Harry</PER> folded <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms and stared at the caretaker.
“Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?” <PER>Cho</PER> was looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it.
Filch opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes with <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
There was a moment’s pause in which Filch glared at <PER>Cho</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER> glared right back, then the caretaker turned and shuffled back toward the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER> looked at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> shrugged; <PER>Harry</PER> was quite as mystified by that as she was, though, oddly, it was not bothering <PER>Harry</PER> very much at the moment.
<PER>Cho</PER> had managed to have an entire conversation with <PER>Cho</PER>'s and not embarrassed <PER>Cho</PER> once You were really brave standing up to <PER>Cho</PER>'s like that <PER>Cho</PER> had called <PER>Cho</PER> brave <PER>Cho</PER> did not hate <PER>Cho</PER> for being alive Of course, <PER>Cho</PER> had preferred Cedric, <PER>Cho</PER> knew that Though if him’d only asked <PER>Cho</PER>'s to the ball before Cedric had, things might have turned out differently <PER>Cho</PER> had seemed sincerely sorry that <PER>Cho</PER> had to refuse when <PER>Harry</PER> had asked <PER>Cho</PER>'s “Morning,” <PER>Harry</PER> said brightly to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, joining them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.
“What are you looking so pleased about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, eyeing <PER>Harry</PER> in surprise.
“Erm Quidditch later,” said <PER>Harry</PER> happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Look, I don’t think you should,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> seriously, “you’re both really behind on homework as it — ” But <PER>Hermione</PER> broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the Daily Prophet was soaring toward <PER>Hermione</PER>'s in the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg; <PER>Hermione</PER> pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper, and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off again.
“Anything interesting?” said <PER>Ron</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> smiled — <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> was keen to get her off the subject of homework.
<PER>Harry</PER> devoted <PER>Harry</PER> to another helping of eggs and bacon; <PER>Ron</PER> was staring up at the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied.
“Oh no Sirius!” “What’s happened?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> snatched at the paper so violently that it ripped down the middle so that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were holding half each.
“Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I’ll bet anything,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a low, furious voice.
‘Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very dangerous killed thirteen people broke out of Azkaban ’ the usual rubbish,” <PER>Hermione</PER> concluded, laying down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s half of the paper and looking fearfully at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did warn <PER>Dumbledore</PER> not to.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet <PER>Harry</PER> had torn off.
“Hey!” he said, flattening it down so <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> could both see it.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “look this little piece here ” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> bent closer to read it; the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought it seemed far-fetched; <PER>Hermione</PER>, on the other hand, looked rather impressed and said, “Do you know, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if that were true.” <PER>Hermione</PER> folded up <PER>Hermione</PER>'s half of the newspaper thoughtfully.
When <PER>Harry</PER> laid down <PER>Harry</PER>'s knife and fork <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to come out of a reverie.
“Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on Self-Fertilizing Shrubs first, and if we’re lucky we’ll be able to start <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting <PER>Harry</PER> upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating blue, and <PER>Harry</PER> had not been on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt for a week “I mean, we can do it tonight,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, as he and <PER>Harry</PER> walked down the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s dire warnings that they would fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing in their ears.
“And we have got plenty of time to do it all” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced over to <PER>Harry</PER>'s right as they approached the Quidditch pitch, to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly.
They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, <PER>Ron</PER> guarding the three tall goalposts, <PER>Harry</PER> playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Ron</PER> was pretty good; <PER>Harry</PER> blocked three-quarters of the goals <PER>Harry</PER> attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced.
After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate lunch, during which <PER>Hermione</PER> made it quite clear that <PER>Hermione</PER> thought they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session.
“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> called in <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s sneering drawl.
<PER>Ron</PER> mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and <PER>Harry</PER> followed him, watching him's ears turn red from behind.
Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to <PER>Harry</PER>, who passed to <PER>Ron</PER>, who dropped it.
<PER>Ron</PER> threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to <PER>Harry</PER>, who passed to George “Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling?” called <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Come on now, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said Angelina crossly, as <PER>Ron</PER> dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle.
“It’ll clear It up in no time.” “All right,” called Angelina, “Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger; <PER>Ron</PER>, get up to the goalposts, <PER>Harry</PER>, release the Snitch when I say so.
“<PER>Ron</PER>’s making a right pig<PER>Ron</PER>’s ear of things, isn’t he?” muttered George, as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch.
“<PER>Harry</PER> was fine when I was practicing with <PER>Harry</PER> this morning.” “Yeah, well, I hope <PER>Harry</PER> hasn’t peaked too soon,” said Fred gloomily.
When Angelina blew Angelina's whistle, <PER>Harry</PER> released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger; from that moment on, <PER>Harry</PER> was barely aware of what the others were doing.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — you’re not covering your middle post!” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was hovering in front of the left-hand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at Fred, who was looking anxious and checking <PER>Harry</PER>'s pockets.
“How was practice?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> rather coolly half an hour later, as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room.
“Completely lousy,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair beside <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I suppose he could’ve played better,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, “but it was only the first training session, like you said” Neither <PER>Harry</PER> nor <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to make much headway with their homework that night.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> was too preoccupied with how badly <PER>Harry</PER> had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the chant of “Gryffindor are losers” out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
By the evening <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though somebody had been beating <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain against the inside of <PER>Harry</PER>'s skull.
“You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>, as they finally laid aside Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra ’s equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter’s moons.
“Listen shall we just ask <PER>Hermione</PER> if we can have a look at what <PER>Hermione</PER>’s done?” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced over at <PER>Hermione</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting with Crookshanks on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lap and chatting merrily to <PER>Ginny</PER> as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of <PER>Hermione</PER>, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks.
“Jupiter’s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,” she said, pointing over <PER>Ron</PER>’s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, “and it’s Io that’s got the volcanos.” “Thanks,” snarled <PER>Ron</PER>, scratching out the offending sentences.
“Sorry, I only — ” “Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize — “<PER>Ron</PER> — ” “I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’m up to my neck in it here — ” “No — look!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was pointing to the nearest window.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both looked over.
<PER>Ron</PER> took it off and the owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across <PER>Ron</PER>’s drawing of the moon Io.
“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: To <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts.
he thrust the letter at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who leaned toward each other to read it together: Dear <PER>Ron</PER>, I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister of Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations.
Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you will say that Potter has always been <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s favorite — but I feel bound to tell you that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different — and probably more accurate — view of Potters behavior.
Your loyalty, <PER>Ron</PER>, should be not to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but to the school and the Ministry.
I am very sorry to hear that so far Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> is encountering very little cooperation from staff as Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> should find this easier from next week — again, see the Prophet tomorrow!
It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under our parents's roof while our parents remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around <PER>Dumbledore</PER> (if you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell Mother's that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry.
Your brother, Percy <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Come on, we’ve got to get this finished some time before dawn,” he said briskly to <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling Professor Sinistra ’s essay back toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was looking at <PER>Ron</PER> with an odd expression on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“Thanks a million, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> weakly, passing over <PER>Harry</PER>'s essay and sinking back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s armchair, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> also felt an odd, sick, empty feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought <PER>Harry</PER> strange, even mad; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to <PER>Harry</PER> for months, but there was something about seeing it written down like that in Percy’s writing, about knowing that Percy was advising <PER>Ron</PER> to drop him and even to tell tales on him to <PER>Umbridge</PER>, that made him's situation real to him as nothing else had.
And with a surge of sympathy for Percy's godfather, <PER>Harry</PER> thought that Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment, because Sirius was in the same situation; nearly everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a great <PER>Voldemort</PER> supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years <PER>Harry</PER> blinked.
No it could not have been He had imagined it because He had been thinking about Sirius “Okay, write that down,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>, pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to <PER>Ron</PER>, “and then copy out this conclusion that I’ve written for you.” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, you are honestly the most wonderful person I’ve ever met,” said <PER>Ron</PER> weakly, “and if I’m ever rude to you again — ” “ — I’ll know you’re back to normal,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra, Europa’s covered in ice, not mice — <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> had slid off <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames.
“Er — <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly.
<PER>Harry</PER> spoke quite calmly; after all, <PER>Harry</PER> had seen Sirius’s head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it too.
Nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER> could not be sure that <PER>Harry</PER> had really seen it this time It had vanished so quickly “Sirius’s head?” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated.
“Well, I think a girl — first year by the look of her — might’ve got a glimpse of me earlier, but don’t worry,” Sirius said hastily, as <PER>Hermione</PER> clapped a hand to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth.
“This was the only way I could come up with of answering <PER>Harry</PER>’s letter without resorting to a code — and codes are breakable.” At the mention of <PER>Harry</PER>’s letter, <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had both turned to stare at him.
“I forgot,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, which was perfectly true; his meeting with <PER>Cho</PER> in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind.
“Anyway, we’d better be quick, just in case we’re disturbed — your scar.” “What about — ?” <PER>Ron</PER> began, but <PER>Hermione</PER> said quickly, “We’ll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.” “Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but We don’t think it’s anything to really worry about.
“So you don’t think it had anything to do with <PER>Umbridge</PER> touching me when I was in detention with her?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“I know her by reputation and I’m sure her’s no Death Eater — ” “She’s foul enough to be one,” said <PER>Harry</PER> darkly and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded vigorously in agreement.
“I know she’s a nasty piece of work, though — you should hear Remus talk about she.” “Does Lupin know she?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, remembering <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s comments about dangerous half-breeds during shis first lesson.
“No,” said Sirius, “but she drafted a bit of anti- werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.” <PER>Harry</PER> remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days and <PER>Harry</PER>'s dislike of <PER>Umbridge</PER> deepened even further.
“Honestly, if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher I’m sure he’d respond, after all, you are the only member of his family he’s got left, and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said — ” “So what are <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s lessons like?” “Sirius interrupted.
“Is she training you all to kill half- breeds?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>’s affronted look at being cut off in her defense of Kreacher.
“What does he think we’re doing here, forming some sort of wizard army?” “That’s exactly what he thinks you’re doing,” said Sirius, “or rather, that’s exactly what he’s afraid <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s doing — forming <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own private army, with which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic.” There was a pause at this, then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with.” “So we’re being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we’ll use spells against the Ministry?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking furious.
“So you haven’t had any news about <PER>Hagrid</PER>, either?” “Ah ” said Sirius, “well, he was supposed to be back by now, no one’s sure what’s happened to he.” Then, seeing their stricken faces, he added quickly, “But <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s not worried, so don’t you three get yourselves in a state; I’m sure <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s fine.” “But if he was supposed to be back by now ” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a small, worried voice.
“Madame Maxime was with Madame Maxime, we’ve been in touch with her and her says they got separated on the journey home — but there’s nothing to suggest he’s hurt or — well, nothing to suggest he’s not perfectly okay.” Unconvinced, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged worried looks.
“Listen, don’t go asking too many questions about <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said Sirius hastily, “it’ll just draw even more attention to the fact that he’s not back, and I know <PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t want that.
“Something <PER>Malfoy</PER> said on the train made us think Something <PER>Malfoy</PER> knew it was you, and Something <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s father was on the platform, Sirius — you know, Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> — so don’t come up here, whatever you do, if <PER>Malfoy</PER> recognizes you again — ” “All right, all right, I’ve got the point,” said Sirius.
“The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James.” “Look — ” “Well, I’d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,” said Sirius, but <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> was lying.
However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline: “ “High Inquisitor’?” said <PER>Harry</PER> darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast slipping from his fingers.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> has been offered this position in addition to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s own teaching post, and we are delighted to say that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> has accepted.’ “The Ministry’s new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, staring at him.
“Oh, I can’t wait to see <PER>McGonagall</PER> inspected,” said <PER>Ron</PER> happily.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> won’t know what’s hit <PER>Umbridge</PER>.” “Well, come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, jumping up, “we’d better get going, if <PER>Hermione</PER>’s inspecting Binns’s class we don’t want to be late” But <PER>Umbridge</PER> was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> in <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where <PER>Harry</PER>’s moonstone essay was handed back to <PER>Harry</PER> with a large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner.
“I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,” said <PER>Snape</PER> with a smirk, as <PER>Snape</PER> swept among them, passing back them's homework.
Determined not to give <PER>Snape</PER> an excuse to fail him this lesson, <PER>Harry</PER> read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them.
His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s but it was at least blue rather than pink, like <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s, and His delivered a flask of it to <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief.
“And the homework didn’t go too badly either, did it?” When neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> answered, she pressed on, “I mean, all right, I didn’t expect the top grade, not if he’s marking to O.W.L.
“Obviously, I’d have been thrilled if I’d gotten an O — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sharply, “if you want to know what grades we got, ask.” “I don’t — I didn’t mean — well, if you want to tell me “I got a P,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, ladling soup into his bowl.
<PER>Harry</PER> laughed again, though <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure whether or not George was joking.
<PER>Harry</PER> imagined trying to conceal from <PER>Hermione</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had received T’s in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on.
“Charms.” “What was it like?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> asked together.
“Trelawney — ” “A T if ever I saw one — ” “ — and <PER>Umbridge</PER> herself.” “Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with <PER>Umbridge</PER> today,” said George.
“Angelina’ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.” But <PER>Harry</PER> did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pulling out <PER>Harry</PER>'s dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when <PER>Ron</PER> elbowed <PER>Harry</PER> in the ribs and, looking round, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> emerging through the trapdoor in the floor.
“Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> with Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s wide smile.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> covertly.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent <PER>Harry</PER>'s head hurriedly over <PER>Harry</PER>'s book.
“Think of a dream, quick,” he told <PER>Ron</PER>, “in case the old toad comes our way.” “I did it last time,” <PER>Ron</PER> protested, “it’s your turn, you tell me one.” “Oh, I dunno ” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days.
“Okay, we’ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject would that be ‘drowning’ or ‘cauldron’ or ‘<PER>Snape</PER>’?” “It doesn’t matter, pick any of them,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, chancing a glance behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was now standing at Professor Trelawney’s shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned <PER>Neville</PER> about the Divination teacher's dream diary.
“I dunno, last night, whenever you like,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to listen to what <PER>Umbridge</PER> was saying to Professor Trelawney.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was making another note on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew she up to shis full height, shis beads and bangles clinking.
“I see,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> softly, making yet another note on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s clipboard.
“Let me see the start you’ve made on your dream diary, please.” And by the time she had interpreted <PER>Harry</PER>’s dreams at the top of shis voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), <PER>Harry</PER> was feeling much less sympathetic toward she.
All the while, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> descended the silver ladder first so that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before <PER>Hermione</PER> could ask any questions Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had called them all to order and silence fell.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year’s lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Hermione</PER> had <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand in the air again.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had noticed too, and what was more, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality.
Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed <PER>Hermione</PER>, she got to shis feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, “What is it this time, Miss Granger?” “I’ve already read chapter two,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“He says ‘counterjinx’ is just a name people give people's jinxes when people want to make people sound more acceptable.” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> raised her eyebrows, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew she was impressed against shis will.
“You disagree?” “Yes, I do,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who, unlike <PER>Umbridge</PER>, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the class’s attention.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not complain during the evening’s detention; <PER>Harry</PER> was determined not to give <PER>Umbridge</PER> the satisfaction; over and over again <PER>Harry</PER> wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips, though the cut deepened with every letter.
“Are you telling me,” she said, lowering shis voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, “that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s class again?” “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, speaking to the floor.
Angelina gave <PER>Harry</PER> a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which <PER>Harry</PER> flung himself onto the bench beside <PER>Ron</PER>, fuming.
“You think <PER>McGonagall</PER> was right, do you?” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily to the picture of <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge obscuring <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face.
“I wish she hadn’t taken points from you, but I think she’s right to warn you not to lose your temper with <PER>Umbridge</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not speak to <PER>Hermione</PER> all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration <PER>Harry</PER> forgot <PER>Harry</PER>'s anger; Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head.
“Let’s see <PER>Umbridge</PER> get what <PER>Umbridge</PER> deserves.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was there.
“Mister Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown, please take this box of mice — don’t be silly, girl, they won’t hurt you — and hand one to each student — ” “Hem, hem,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on the first night of term.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> ignored Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Seamus handed back <PER>Harry</PER>’s essay; <PER>Harry</PER> took it without looking at <PER>Harry</PER> and saw, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s relief, that <PER>Harry</PER> had managed an A.
“Yes?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning round, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line.
“I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec — ” “Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning her back firmly on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> did not follow Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought that Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> would not permit it.
she did, however, take many more notes while she sat in shis corner, and when Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim expression on Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s face.
As they filed out of the classroom, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> approach the teacher’s desk; <PER>Harry</PER> nudged <PER>Ron</PER>, who nudged <PER>Hermione</PER> in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop.
“Thirty-nine years this December,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> brusquely, snapping Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s bag shut.
“Very well,” she said, “you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days’ time.” “I can hardly wait,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> in a coldly indifferent voice, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> strode off toward the door.
“Hurry up, you three,” she added, sweeping <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> before her.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn <PER>Harry</PER> received one in return.
<PER>Harry</PER> had thought that the next time <PER>Harry</PER> would see <PER>Umbridge</PER> would be in <PER>Harry</PER>'s detention that evening, but <PER>Harry</PER> was wrong.
“I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor <PER>Hagrid</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> exchanged uneasy looks with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; <PER>Malfoy</PER> would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on <PER>Hagrid</PER> to a member of the Ministry.
“Hmm,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, dropping her voice, though <PER>Harry</PER> could still hear her quite clearly, “I wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — can you tell me what is causing Professor <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s very extended leave of absence?” <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> look up eagerly.
Most people were able to answer well and <PER>Harry</PER>’s spirits lifted somewhat; at least this class was not letting <PER>Hagrid</PER> down.
“No, I’m very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.” Looking politely incredulous, <PER>Umbridge</PER> made a tiny note on <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s clipboard and went on, “And what are you planning to cover with this class this year — assuming, of course, that Professor <PER>Hagrid</PER> does not return?” “Oh, I’ll take them through the creatures that most often come up in O.W.L.,” said Professor Grubbly- Plank.
“Not much left to do — they’ve studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we’d cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know” “Well, you seem to know what you’re doing, at any rate,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, making a very obvious tick on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s clipboard.
“Only because he was too stupid to listen to what <PER>Hagrid</PER> told him to do,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> groaned.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> turned her head slowly in <PER>Harry</PER>’s direction.
ie ie ie It was nearly midnight when <PER>Harry</PER> left <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office that night, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf <PER>Harry</PER> had wrapped around it.
<PER>Harry</PER> expected the common room to be empty when <PER>Harry</PER> returned, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had sat up waiting for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see them, especially as <PER>Hermione</PER> was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical.
“Here,” she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward <PER>Harry</PER>, “soak your hand in that, it’s a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.” <PER>Harry</PER> placed help.” <PER>Harry</PER>'s bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief.
“<PER>McGonagall</PER> would go nuts if she knew — ” “Yeah, she probably would,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And how long d’you reckon it’d take <PER>Umbridge</PER> to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?” <PER>Ron</PER> opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way.
“You know, I was thinking today” She shot a slightly nervous look at <PER>Harry</PER> and then plunged on, “I was thinking that — maybe the time’s come when we should just — just do it we.” “Do what we?” said <PER>Harry</PER> suspiciously, still floating <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> goggled at her.
“Don’t be silly, of course there is!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W.
“It’s about preparing ourselves, like <PER>Harry</PER> said in <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s first lesson, for what’s waiting out there.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Ron</PER>, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when <PER>Hermione</PER> elaborated on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s consternation, however, <PER>Ron</PER> did not look exasperated.
“Teaching us to do it.” “But ” <PER>Harry</PER> was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg.
“But I’m not a teacher, I can’t — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Uh first year — you saved the Stone from <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” “But that was luck,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “that wasn’t skill — ” “Second year,” <PER>Ron</PER> interrupted, “you killed the basilisk and destroyed <PER>Riddle</PER>.” “Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I — ” “Third year,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, louder still, “you fought off about a hundred dementors at once — ” “You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn’t “Last year,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, almost shouting now, “you fought off <PER>Voldemort</PER> again — ” “Listen to me!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, almost angrily, because <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were both smirking now.
Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s smiles had vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> was feeling ashamed of <PER>Harry</PER>'s outburst already.
<PER>Harry</PER> nodded, hardly aware of what <PER>Harry</PER> was agreeing to.
“Well, I’m off to bed,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said in a voice that was clearly as natural as <PER>Hermione</PER> could make it.
<PER>Hermione</PER> made no mention of <PER>Harry</PER> giving Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after <PER>Hermione</PER>'s original suggestion.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s detentions with <PER>Umbridge</PER> were finally over (<PER>Harry</PER> doubted whether the words now etched on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand would ever fade entirely); <PER>Ron</PER> had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to vanish them's mice in Transfiguration (<PER>Hermione</PER> had actually progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for <PER>Snape</PER>.
“I was wondering,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said suddenly, “whether you’d thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “ ’Course I have,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grumpily.
“Can’t forget it, can we, with that hag teaching we — ” “I meant the idea <PER>Ron</PER> and I had” — <PER>Ron</PER> cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look; she frowned at him — “oh, all right, the idea !
Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night <PER>Hermione</PER> had proposed it, but at others, he had found he thinking about the spells that had served he best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters — found he, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons “Well,” he said slowly, when he could not pretend to find Asiatic anti-venoms interesting much longer, “yeah, I — I’ve thought about it a bit.” “And?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> eagerly.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I thought it was a good idea from the start,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure that <PER>Harry</PER> was not going to start shouting again.
<PER>Harry</PER> shifted uncomfortably in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
“You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn’t you?” “Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> gently, “but all the same, there’s no point pretending that you’re not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts, because you are.
“He said <PER>Harry</PER> knew how to do stuff even <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t, and <PER>Harry</PER> was in the final year at Durmstrang.” <PER>Ron</PER> was looking at <PER>Hermione</PER> suspiciously.
“You’re not still in contact with him, are you?” “So what if I am?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> coolly, though <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face was a little pink.
<PER>Hermione</PER> shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head exasperatedly and, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>, who was continuing to watch her, said to <PER>Harry</PER>, “Well, what do you think?
“Because,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, returning to the diagram of the Chinese <PER>Cho</PER>mping Cabbage she was copying, “I don’t think <PER>Umbridge</PER> would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.” <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying <PER>Harry</PER>.
Sirius had maintained a stony silence since <PER>Harry</PER> had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; <PER>Harry</PER> knew they had made <PER>Harry</PER> angry by saying that they did not want <PER>Harry</PER> to come — but <PER>Harry</PER> still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway.
What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
“Well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and about,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> discussed him's fears with him and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“The trouble is,” she said to <PER>Harry</PER>, “until V-<PER>Voldemort</PER> — oh for heaven’s sake, <PER>Ron</PER> — comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn’t <PER>Ron</PER> —?
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d go mad if he did and Sirius listens to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> even if he doesn’t like what he hears.” When <PER>Harry</PER> continued to look worried, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Listen, <PER>Ron</PER> and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested.
“Don’t worry, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said quietly.
<PER>Ron</PER> was even further behind with his work than <PER>Harry</PER>, because while they both had Quidditch practices twice a week, <PER>Ron</PER> also had prefect duties.
With a slight pang, <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that if it hadn’t been for Sirius, <PER>Harry</PER> would not have been going at all.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and <PER>Harry</PER> walked on, out onto the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.
“Er — why was Filch sniffing you?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, as he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, very skeptically.
“The Three Broomsticks?” “Oh — no,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, coming out of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s reverie, “no, it’s always packed and really noisy.
The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as <PER>Harry</PER> stepped onto it <PER>Harry</PER> realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Hagrid</PER> mentioning this pub in his first year: “Yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head,” Yeh had said, explaining how Yeh had won a dragons egg from a hooded stranger there.
At the time <PER>Harry</PER> had wondered why <PER>Hagrid</PER> had not found it odd that the stranger kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s face hidden throughout their encounter; now <PER>Harry</PER> saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog’s Head.
“I don’t know about this, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, as they crossed to the bar.
“Has it occurred to you <PER>Umbridge</PER> might be under that?” <PER>Hermione</PER> cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure.
“And anyway, even if <PER>Umbridge</PER> does come in here there’s nothing she can do to stop us, <PER>Harry</PER>, because I’ve double- and triple-checked the school rules.
<PER>Harry</PER> was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to <PER>Harry</PER>.
The barman’s eyes traveled over <PER>Harry</PER>, resting for a fraction of a second on <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> turned away and deposited <PER>Harry</PER>’s money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> retreated to the farthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages rapped the counter with the man in the dirty gray bandages's knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman.
“Yeah “So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, wrenching open the rusty top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s butterbeer and taking a swig.
“Just a couple of people,” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated, checking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch and then looking anxiously toward the door.
First came <PER>Neville</PER> with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (<PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach did a back flip) <PER>Cho</PER> and one of <PER>Cho</PER>'s usually giggling girlfriends, then (on <PER>Cho</PER>'s own and looking so dreamy that <PER>Cho</PER> might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name <PER>Harry</PER> did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot; <PER>Ginny</PER>, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom <PER>Harry</PER> recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko’s merchandise.
“A couple of people?” said <PER>Harry</PER> hoarsely to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What are they expecting?” “I’ve told you, they just want to hear what you’ve got to say,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> soothingly; but <PER>Harry</PER> continued to look at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s so furiously that <PER>Hermione</PER> added quickly, “You don’t have to do anything yet, I’ll speak to them first.” “Hi, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, beaming and taking a seat opposite <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to smile back, but did not speak; <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth was exceptionally dry.
<PER>Cho</PER> had just smiled at <PER>Harry</PER> and sat down on <PER>Ron</PER>’s right.
<PER>Cho</PER> friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave <PER>Harry</PER> a thoroughly mistrustful look that told <PER>Harry</PER> plainly that, given her way, her would not be here at all.
In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space.
<PER>Cho</PER>’s friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down <PER>Cho</PER>’s friend, Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch, Padma Patil shuddered, and <PER>Neville</PER> gave an odd yelp that Padma Patil managed to turn into a cough.
“Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believes it — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
“You mean, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believes <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said the blond boy, nodding at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “and I think we’ve got the right to know exactly what makes him say <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back.” “Look,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, intervening swiftly, “that’s really not what this meeting was supposed to be about — ” “It’s okay, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt that <PER>Hermione</PER> should have seen this coming.
“What makes me say <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> asked, looking Zacharias straight in the face.
“I never knew that!” “Mum told <PER>Ron</PER> not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; <PER>Harry</PER> was determinedly looking anywhere but at <PER>Cho</PER>.
“And in our first year,” said <PER>Neville</PER> to the group at large, “<PER>Harry</PER> saved that Sorcerous Stone — ” “Sorcerer’s,” hissed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Yes, that, from <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” finished <PER>Neville</PER>.
“And that’s not to mention,” said <PER>Cho</PER> (<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes snapped onto <PER>Cho</PER>, <PER>Cho</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, smiling; <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach did another somersault), “all the tasks <PER>Harry</PER> had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year — getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and things” There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table.
<PER>Harry</PER> was trying to arrange <PER>Harry</PER>'s face so that <PER>Harry</PER> did not look too pleased with <PER>Harry</PER>.
The fact that <PER>Cho</PER> had just praised <PER>Harry</PER> made it much, much harder for <PER>Harry</PER> to say the thing <PER>Harry</PER> had sworn to <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> would tell them.
“Here’s an idea,” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, before <PER>Harry</PER> could speak, “why don’t you shut your mouth?” Perhaps the word “weasel” had affected <PER>Ron</PER> particularly strongly; in any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump Zacharias.
“Yes, well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily, “moving on the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from <PER>Harry</PER>?” There was a murmur of general agreement.
“I’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, slightly impatiently, “but you know, this is rather important, we’re talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s Death Eaters — ” “Well said!” barked Ernie Macmillan, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had been expecting to speak long before this.
“Great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of — ” “They don’t exist, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tartly.
“There are plenty of eyewitness accounts, just because you’re so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you — ” “Hem, hem,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> in such a good imitation of Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “<PER>McGonagall</PER> might let us have hers, hers did when <PER>Harry</PER> was practicing for the Tri wizard” But <PER>Harry</PER> was pretty certain that <PER>McGonagall</PER> would not be so accommodating this time.
For all that <PER>Hermione</PER> had said about study and homework groups being allowed, <PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct feeling this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.
<PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyebrows at him.
“And if this list was found well, I mean to say you said yourself, if <PER>Umbridge</PER> finds out ” “You just said this group was the most important thing you’d do this year,” <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I — yes, of course I’ll sign.” Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Cho</PER>’s friend give <PER>Cho</PER>'s a rather reproachful look before adding <PER>Cho</PER>'s name.
When the last person — Zacharias — had signed, <PER>Hermione</PER> took the parchment back and slipped the parchment carefully into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag.
<PER>Cho</PER> made rather a business of fastening the catch on <PER>Cho</PER>'s bag before leaving, <PER>Cho</PER>'s long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide <PER>Cho</PER>'s face, but <PER>Cho</PER>'s friend stood beside <PER>Cho</PER>, arms folded, clicking <PER>Cho</PER>'s tongue, so that <PER>Cho</PER> had little choice but to leave with <PER>Cho</PER>.
As her friend ushered her through the door, <PER>Cho</PER> looked back and waved at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I think that went quite well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> happily, as <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> walked out of the Hog’s Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> still clutching their bottles of butterbeer.
“She’s going out with — my sister’s going — what d’you mean, Michael Corner?” “Well, that’s why he and his friends came, I think — well, they’re obviously interested in learning defense, but if <PER>Ginny</PER> hadn’t told Michael what was going on — “When did this — when did she — ?” “They met at the Yule Ball and They got together at the end of last year,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> composedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed her.
“Big surprise,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath.
“But,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, following <PER>Hermione</PER> along a row of quills in copper pots, “I thought <PER>Ginny</PER> fancied <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at him rather pityingly and shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> used to fancy <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Ginny</PER> gave up on <PER>Harry</PER> months ago.
<PER>Harry</PER>, whose head was still full of <PER>Cho</PER>’s parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as <PER>Ron</PER>, who was positively quivering with indignation, but this subject did bring something home to him that until now him had not really registered.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> never used to talk in front of me.” “Exactly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, “this is exactly why <PER>Ginny</PER> hasn’t told you <PER>Ginny</PER>’s seeing Michael, <PER>Ginny</PER> knew you’d take it badly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> rolled her eyes at <PER>Harry</PER> and then said in an undertone, while <PER>Ron</PER> was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, “And talking about Michael and <PER>Ginny</PER> what about <PER>Cho</PER> and you?” “What d’you mean?” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, smiling slightly, “<PER>Hermione</PER> just couldn’t keep <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes off you, could <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt happier for the rest of the weekend than <PER>Harry</PER> had done all term.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> spent much of Sunday catching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room, they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake.
The knowledge that they were doing something to resist <PER>Umbridge</PER> and the Ministry, and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave <PER>Harry</PER> a feeling of immense satisfaction.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept reliving Saturday’s meeting in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind: all those people, coming to <PER>Harry</PER> to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts and the looks on all those people's faces as they had heard some of the things <PER>Harry</PER> had done and <PER>Cho</PER> praising <PER>Harry</PER>'s performance in the Triwizard Tournament The knowledge that all those people did not think <PER>Harry</PER> a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed <PER>Harry</PER> up so much that <PER>Harry</PER> was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all him's least favorite classes.
Signed: Dolores Jane <PER>Umbridge</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> read the notice over the heads of some anxious-looking second years.
“Or — I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look too — ” “I wonder if <PER>Hermione</PER>’s seen this yet?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking around at the door to the girls’ dormitories.
There was a brief moment when <PER>Ron</PER> tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backward and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet.
“Er — I don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’ dormitories,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and trying not to laugh.
“Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?” they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>’s allowed in our dormitory, how come our’re not allowed — ?” “Well, it’s an old-fashioned rule,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had just slid neatly onto a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet, “but it says in Hogwarts, A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls.
“You’re so naive,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “you think just because you’re all honorable and trustworthy — ” “No, they can’t have done because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly.
“Believe me, if anyone’s run off and told <PER>Umbridge</PER>, well know exactly who they are and they will really regret it.” “What’ll happen to them?” said <PER>Ron</PER> eagerly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had barely taken <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s seats when <PER>Neville</PER>, Dean, Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> descended upon them.
“The prefects as well?” said Fred, looking quizzically at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Cho</PER> was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend <PER>Cho</PER> had brought along to the Hog’s Head.
Would <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s notice scare <PER>Cho</PER>'s off meeting them again?
“It’s okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, when she was near enough to hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Don’t worry, I’ll behave myself” “Bet <PER>Umbridge</PER> is in History of Magic,” said <PER>Ron</PER> grimly, as they set off for Binns’s lesson.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not even attempt to follow what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying today; <PER>Harry</PER> doodled idly on <PER>Harry</PER>'s parchment ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>’s frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped quietly off <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair, crouched down, and hurried along the row to the window, where <PER>Harry</PER> slid the catch and opened it very slowly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had expected Hedwig to hold out Hedwig's leg so that <PER>Harry</PER> could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, crouched low again, and sped back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat with Hedwig on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> regained <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat, transferred Hedwig to <PER>Harry</PER>'s lap, and made to remove the letter tied to Hedwig's leg.
“She’s hurt!” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, bending <PER>Harry</PER>'s head low over her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned in closer; <PER>Hermione</PER> even put down her quill.
“Professor Binns,” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Not at all well,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet while concealing Hedwig behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
“Yes yes, hospital wing well, off you go, then, Perkins ” Once outside the room <PER>Harry</PER> returned Hedwig to <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when <PER>Harry</PER> was out of sight of Binns’s door.
<PER>Harry</PER> first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been <PER>Hagrid</PER>, of course, but as His had no idea where <PER>Hagrid</PER> was, his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would help.
As <PER>Harry</PER> approached, one of Two stone gargoyles croaked, “You should be in class, sunny Jim.” “This is urgent,” said <PER>Harry</PER> curtly.
“Well, that’s put us in us place, hasn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER> knocked; <PER>Harry</PER> heard footsteps and then the door opened and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> face-to-face with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“It’s my owl, she’s injured.” “Injured owl, did you say?” Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, lifting Hedwig carefully off <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, “she turned up after the other post owls and shis wing’s all funny, look — ” Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from <PER>Harry</PER> while Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> watched.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, however, looked sharply at <PER>Harry</PER> and said, “Do you know how far this owl’s traveled, Potter?” “Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared into the staffroom carrying Hedwig, who was staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though unable to believe <PER>Harry</PER> would give her away like this.
Feeling slightly guilty, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to go, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> called <PER>Harry</PER> back.
“Bear in mind,” She said quickly and quietly, Shis eyes on the scroll in his hand, “that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched, won’t you?” “I — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staffroom, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd.
Here he spotted <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> already standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up against the wind.
<PER>Harry</PER> slit open the scroll as <PER>Harry</PER> hurried toward them and found five words in Sirius’s handwriting: Today, same time, same place.
“Where did you take <PER>Hermione</PER>?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“And I met <PER>McGonagall</PER> Listen” And <PER>Harry</PER> told them what <PER>McGonagall</PER> had said.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking from <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER> and back again.
“I just hope nobody else has read this” “But it was still sealed and everything,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to convince <PER>Harry</PER> as much as her.
“And nobody would understand what it meant if they didn’t know where we’d spoken to <PER>Harry</PER> before, would they?” “I don’t know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously, hitching <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag back over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoulder as the bell rang again.
“It wouldn’t be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by magic And if anyone’s watching the Floo Network but I don’t really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted too!” They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all three of They lost in thought, but as They reached the bottom of the stairs they were recalled to they by the voice of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was standing just outside <PER>Snape</PER>’s classroom door, waving around an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word.
“It’s what he wants” “I mean,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, raising his voice a little more, his gray eyes glittering malevolently in <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s direction, “if it’s a question of influence with the Ministry, I don’t think they’ve got much chance From what my father says, they’ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years And as for Potter my father says it’s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St. Mungo’s apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic” <PER>Malfoy</PER> made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling.
Something collided hard with <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, knocking <PER>Harry</PER> sideways.
A split second later he realized that <PER>Neville</PER> had just charged past him, heading straight for <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, no!” <PER>Harry</PER> leapt forward and seized the back of <PER>Neville</PER>’s robes; <PER>Neville</PER> struggled frantically, <PER>Harry</PER>'s fists flailing, trying desperately to get at <PER>Malfoy</PER> who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked.
“Help me!” <PER>Harry</PER> flung at <PER>Ron</PER>, managing to get an arm around <PER>Neville</PER>’s neck and dragging <PER>Harry</PER> backward, away from the Slytherins.
<PER>Ron</PER> hurried forward and seized <PER>Neville</PER>’s arms; together, he and <PER>Harry</PER> succeeded in dragging <PER>Neville</PER> back into the Gryffindor line.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s face was scarlet; the pressure <PER>Harry</PER> was exerting on <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat rendered <PER>Harry</PER> quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
<PER>Snape</PER> black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were wrestling with <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?” <PER>Snape</PER> said in <PER>Snape</PER>'s cold, sneering voice.
“I had to stop you,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, picking up <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag.
“Crabbe and Goyle would’ve torn you apart.” <PER>Neville</PER> said nothing, <PER>Neville</PER> merely snatched up <PER>Neville</PER>'s own bag and stalked off into the dungeon.
“What in the name of Merlin,” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly, as they followed <PER>Neville</PER>, “was that about?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St. Mungo’s because of magical damage to people who were in St. Mungo’s's brains was highly distressing to <PER>Neville</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had sworn to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> would not tell anyone <PER>Neville</PER>’s secret.
Even <PER>Neville</PER> did not know that <PER>Harry</PER> knew.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took their usual seats at the back of the class and pulled out parchment, quills, and their copies of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.
The class around them was whispering about what <PER>Neville</PER> had just done, but when <PER>Snape</PER> closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang everybody fell silent immediately.
“You will notice,” said <PER>Snape</PER> in <PER>Snape</PER>'s low, sneering voice, “that we have a guest with us today.” He gestured toward the dim corner of the dungeon, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> sitting there, clipboard on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s knee.
He glanced sideways at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, his eyebrows raised.
<PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Umbridge</PER>, the two teachers he hated most it was hard to decide which he wanted to triumph over the other.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very interested in hearing her question <PER>Snape</PER>, so interested, that <PER>Harry</PER> was becoming careless with <PER>Harry</PER>'s potion again.
“Salamander blood, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned, grabbing his wrist to prevent his adding the wrong ingredient for the third time.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> had just gotten to <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s feet.
His eyes on <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> added a few drops to <PER>Harry</PER>'s potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange.
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> asked <PER>Snape</PER>.
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?” “Yes,” said <PER>Snape</PER> quietly, barely moving <PER>Snape</PER>'s lips.
“Do you have any idea why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has consistently refused to appoint you?” asked <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“I suggest you ask <PER>Umbridge</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER> jerkily.
“I suppose this is relevant?” <PER>Snape</PER> asked, <PER>Snape</PER>'s black eyes narrowed.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> and their eyes met for a second.
<PER>Harry</PER> hastily dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s gaze to <PER>Harry</PER>'s potion, which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber.
“No marks again, then, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> maliciously, emptying <PER>Harry</PER>’s cauldron with a wave of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Snape</PER> had already given them homework, and <PER>Snape</PER> had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights.
“I’ll pretend to be ill and do <PER>Snape</PER>’s essay instead, then I won’t have to stay up half the night” “You can’t skive off Divination,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> severely.
“I just think her’s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud But <PER>Harry</PER>’s already missed History of Magic and I don’t think <PER>Harry</PER> ought to miss anything else today!” There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later <PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat in the hot, over- perfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom feeling angry at everybody.
Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and swept away, her lips pursed; her threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus’s head, and thrust the final one into <PER>Neville</PER>’s chest with such force that Professor Trelawney slipped off Professor Trelawney's pouf.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was the matter.
may well choose to leave the indignity of it on probation we shall see how she dares ” “You and <PER>Umbridge</PER> have got something in common,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly when they met again in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter, entitled The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack.’ There will be — ” “ — no need to talk,” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> said together under their breaths.
“No Quidditch practice,” said Angelina in hollow tones when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the common room that night after dinner.
“She’s given the Slytherins permission, why not us?” But <PER>Harry</PER> could imagine how much <PER>Umbridge</PER> was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon.
“Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “look on the bright side — at least now you’ll have time to do <PER>Snape</PER>’s essay!” “That’s a bright side, is it?” snapped <PER>Harry</PER>, while <PER>Ron</PER> stared incredulously at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“No Quidditch practice and extra Potions?” <PER>Harry</PER> slumped down into a chair, dragged <PER>Harry</PER>'s Potions essay reluctantly from <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, and set to work.
Lee Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing Spell <PER>Snape</PER> kept using on <PER>Harry</PER>’s potions.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was not helping matters; the cheers and sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George’s bucket were punctuated by loud and disapproving sniffs that <PER>Harry</PER> found, if anything, more distracting.
“they’re quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves, and I can’t find a rule that says the other idiots aren’t entitled to buy the other idiots, not unless the other idiots’re proven to be dangerous in some way, and it doesn’t look as though they are” She, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> watched George projectile-vomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew, and straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, they’ve got about twenty-six Galleons already” It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasleys dispersed, and then Fred, Lee, and George sat up counting Lee, and George's takings even longer, so that it was well past midnight when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> finally had the common room to themselves again.
As he put his books away, <PER>Ron</PER>, who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, looked blearily into the fire and said, “Sirius!” <PER>Harry</PER> whipped around; Sirius’s untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again.
“Hi,” chorused <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, all three kneeling down upon the hearthrug.
“Not that good,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers.
“You’ve got a lot to learn, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “Who overheard us?” <PER>Harry</PER> demanded.
“What was <PER>Harry</PER> doing in the Hog’s Head?” “What do you think <PER>Harry</PER> was doing?” said Sirius impatiently.
“D’you think your father and I would’ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” “But — last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks — ” “Last year all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said Sirius impatiently.
“This year we know that there’s someone outside Hogwarts who’d like to kill us all, so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!” “And if we do get expelled?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, a quizzical look on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, this whole thing was your idea!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Hear, hear,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> enthusiastically.
“Hey, that’s an idea!” said <PER>Ron</PER> excitedly, but <PER>Hermione</PER> made a skeptical noise and all three of them looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, Sirius’s head turning in the flames.
“Well, I’m sure you’ll come up with somewhere There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you might have enough space to practice jinxes in there — ” “Fred and George told me it’s blocked,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Why did he — ?” <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a horrified gasp and leapt to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, still staring at the fire.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> has been reading your mail, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Watch your frog, it’s escaping.” <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully toward the other side of the table — “Acciol ” — and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand.
Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s whispered discussion about how <PER>Umbridge</PER> had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.
“Silenciol” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily, pointing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at <PER>Harry</PER>’s frog, which deflated silently before them.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s not stupid, <PER>Harry</PER> knows she nearly got <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s the way you’re moving your wand,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, watching <PER>Ron</PER> critically.
“Fine, let’s swap,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, seizing <PER>Ron</PER>’s raven and replacing it with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own fat bullfrog.
“Very good, Miss Granger!” said Professor Flitwick’s squeaky little voice and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> all jumped.
It came as no surprise to any of them that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were given additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework.
“To re-form the Quidditch team!” “Excellent.” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> together.
“I went to <PER>McGonagall</PER> and I think she might have appealed to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — anyway, <PER>Umbridge</PER> had to give in.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s smile slipped slightly as <PER>Ron</PER>’s looked out of the window, which was now opaque with hammering rain.
“Hope this clears up What’s up with you, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> too was gazing at the window, but not as though <PER>Hermione</PER> really saw it.
<PER>Hermione</PER> eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“It would’ve been really annoying if you hadn’t explained yourself properly.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at him as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had only just realized him was there.
“I was just wondering,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice stronger now, “whether we’re doing the right thing, starting this Defense Against the Dark Arts group.” “What!” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, it was your idea in the first place!” said <PER>Ron</PER> indignantly.
“I know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, twisting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers together.
“Let’s get this straight,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, as they put their bags back on the floor, “Sirius agrees with us, so you don’t think us should do it anymore?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked tense and rather miserable.
Now staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own hands <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Do you honestly trust his judgment?” “Yes, I do!” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
<PER>Hermione</PER> watched Katie leap to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke again and it sounded as though <PER>Hermione</PER> was choosing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s words very carefully.
“Sirius is right,” he said, “you do sound just like my mother.” <PER>Hermione</PER> bit <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip and did not answer.
The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven o’clock that evening, when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and shot upward, the wind pulling <PER>Harry</PER> slightly off course.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no idea how <PER>Harry</PER> was going to see the Snitch in this weather; <PER>Harry</PER> was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing; a minute into the practice it almost unseated <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid the Sloth Grip Roll.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear them complaining in low voices as <PER>Harry</PER> toweled <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair dry.
<PER>Harry</PER> emerged from behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s towel; the changing room was blurred because <PER>Harry</PER> was not wearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses; but <PER>Harry</PER> could still tell that everyone’s face was turned toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But ” Looking scared, <PER>Ron</PER> strode across to the window and stared out into the rain, “He — He can’t be near us now, can He?” “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, sinking onto a bench and rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
“Did you get a vision, or something?” <PER>Harry</PER> sat quite still, staring at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, allowing <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind and <PER>Harry</PER>'s memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain A confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices “He wants something done, and it’s not happening fast enough,” He said.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and covered <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, pressing down upon them with <PER>Harry</PER>'s palms.
He felt <PER>Ron</PER> sit down on the bench beside him and knew <PER>Ron</PER> was staring at him.
“What is it, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking then?” <PER>Harry</PER> back.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been looking into <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s face <PER>Harry</PER> scar had hurt and <PER>Harry</PER> had had that odd feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach a strange, leaping feeling a happy feeling But, of course, <PER>Harry</PER> had not recognized it for what it was, as <PER>Harry</PER> had been feeling so miserable <PER>Harry</PER> “Last time, it was because he was pleased,” he said.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re reading <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> is watching the owls and the fires, remember?” “Well then, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ” “I’ve just told you, he already knows,” said <PER>Harry</PER> shortly, getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, taking <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak off <PER>Harry</PER>'s peg, and swinging it around <PER>Harry</PER>.
“There’s no point telling him again.” <PER>Ron</PER> did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching <PER>Harry</PER> thoughtfully.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d want to know,” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d said.
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice and <PER>Harry</PER> came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> was rather grateful that she was not around because <PER>Harry</PER> did not much want to discuss <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar hurting and have shis urge <PER>Harry</PER> to go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> too.
<PER>Ron</PER> kept throwing him anxious glances, but <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s Potions book and set to work to finish <PER>Harry</PER>'s essay, though <PER>Harry</PER> was only pretending to concentrate and, by the time that <PER>Ron</PER> said he was going to bed too, had written hardly anything.
Midnight came and went while <PER>Harry</PER> was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, lovage, and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness <PER>Hermione</PER> said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in Grimmauld Place moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used the Daily Prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they found out that his knew what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was feeling therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts confusing was the word, all right; why did his know what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was feeling?
where the wizard is desirous how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would like to sleep of producing hot-headedness It was warm and comfortable in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s armchair before the fire, with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes and Crookshanks purring and the crackling of the flames The book slipped from <PER>Harry</PER>’s slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug.
“Er have you been taking all the clothes <PER>Hermione</PER>’s been leaving out?” “Oh no, sir,” said Dobby happily, “Dobby has been taking some for Winky too, sir.” “Yeah, how is Winky?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Harry</PER> Potter does not seem happy,” Dobby went on, straightening up again and looking timidly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’ve had worse.” The elf surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s vast, orblike eyes.
Then he said very seriously, his ears drooping, “Dobby wishes he could help <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, for <PER>Harry</PER> Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier now” <PER>Harry</PER> smiled.
“You can’t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer” <PER>Harry</PER> bent and picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s Potions book.
“It is a most amazing room, sir.” “How many people know about it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting up straighter in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
“We could go now, if you like!” For a moment <PER>Harry</PER> was tempted to go now; <PER>Harry</PER> was halfway out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat, intending to hurry upstairs for <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like <PER>Hermione</PER>’s whispered in his ear: reckless.
“Not tonight, Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER> reluctantly, sinking back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
“Good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, when she told <PER>Harry</PER>, “because we’ve found somewhere to have we first Defense meeting.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> told you about it?” “Just in passing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shrugging.
“Oh well, that’s all right then,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised no more objections.
Somewhat to <PER>Harry</PER>’s disappointment, it was <PER>Ginny</PER> who managed to find <PER>Cho</PER> Chang and <PER>Ginny</PER>'s friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had turned up in the Hog’s Head.
At half-past seven <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the Gryffindor common room, <PER>Harry</PER> clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“Hold it,” said <PER>Harry</PER> warningly, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and muttering, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” A map of Hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface of the parchment.
“Filch is on the second floor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, holding the map close to <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and scanning it closely, “and Mistress Norris is on the fourth.” “And <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously.
“Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in <PER>Harry</PER>'s relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch.
<PER>Ron</PER> had screwed up his eyes in concentration, <PER>Hermione</PER> was whispering something under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath, <PER>Harry</PER>’s fists were clenched as <PER>Harry</PER> stared ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Just give We a place to practice somewhere they can’t find us “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply, as they wheeled around after their third walk past.
“A Compendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions The Dark Arts Outsmarted Self-Defensive Spellwork wow ” She looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, Shis face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced <PER>Hermione</PER> that what they were doing was right.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around; <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, Lavender, Parvati, and Dean had arrived.
“What is this place?” <PER>Harry</PER> began to explain, but before <PER>Harry</PER> had finished more people had arrived, and <PER>Harry</PER> had to start all over again.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> carefully marked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside.
“What, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “I think we ought to elect a leader,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s leader,” said <PER>Cho</PER> at once, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though <PER>Cho</PER> were mad, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach did yet another back flip.
“I was thinking,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, frowning at Fred, “more of a name that didn’t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.” “The Defense Association?” said <PER>Cho</PER>.
“I don’t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help we against <PER>Voldemort</PER>, do you?” “I’ve used it against <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth slightly drier than usual with all those eyes upon him, “I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice.” It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too quick for <PER>Neville</PER>, whose wand went spinning out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks, and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which <PER>Harry</PER> retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.
“Expelliarmusl” said <PER>Neville</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand.
“I’ve never done IT before — I DID IT!” “Good one!” said <PER>Harry</PER> encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel situation <PER>Neville</PER>’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held loosely at <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
“Listen, <PER>Neville</PER>, can you take it in turns to practice with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?” <PER>Harry</PER> moved off into the middle of the room.
“Sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said George hastily, when <PER>Harry</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was teamed with Michael Corner; <PER>Ginny</PER> was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx <PER>Ginny</PER>.
He avoided going near <PER>Cho</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER>'s friend for a while, but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt He could not ignore them any longer.
“Oh no,” said <PER>Cho</PER> rather wildly as <PER>Cho</PER> approached.
“ Expelliarmiousl I mean, Exnellimellius\ I — oh, sorry, Marietta!” Her curly-haired friend’s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extinguished it with <PER>Cho</PER>'s own wand and glared at <PER>Harry</PER> as though it was his fault.
“You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!” <PER>Cho</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> ruefully.
“That was quite good,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied, but when she raised shis eyebrows <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I was watching from over there” she laughed.
“Well, they’ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of <PER>Umbridge</PER> too,” said <PER>Cho</PER>, drawing <PER>Cho</PER> up proudly.
“Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> called from the other end of the room, “have you checked the time?” He looked down at He's watch and received a shock — it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out-of-bounds.
“That was really, really good, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, when finally it was just her, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> left.
“Did you see me disarm <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Only once,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, stung.
<PER>Harry</PER> had one eye on the Marauder’s Map, but <PER>Harry</PER> was also thinking of how <PER>Cho</PER> had said <PER>Cho</PER> made <PER>Cho</PER>'s nervous <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> were carrying some kind of talisman inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest over the following two weeks, a glowing secret that supported <PER>Harry</PER> through <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s classes and even made it possible for <PER>Harry</PER> to smile blandly as <PER>Harry</PER> looked into her horrible bulging eyes.
were resisting her under her very nose, doing the very thing that her and the Ministry most feared, and whenever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard’s book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings, remembering how <PER>Neville</PER> had successfully disarmed <PER>Hermione</PER>, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after three meetings’ hard effort, how Parvati Patil had produced such a good Reductor Curse that Parvati Patil had reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to dust.
meetings, as they had to accommodate three separate Quidditch teams’ practices, which were often rearranged depending on the weather conditions; but <PER>Harry</PER> was not sorry about this, <PER>Harry</PER> had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable.
a fake Galleon (<PER>Ron</PER> became very excited when he saw the basket at first, convinced that <PER>Hermione</PER> was actually giving out gold).
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“That is where I got the idea but you’ll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members’ skin” “Yeah I prefer your way,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning, as <PER>Harry</PER> slipped <PER>Harry</PER>'s Galleon into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized how much Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> cared about beating Slytherin when Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match.
Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and said grimly, “I’ve become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don’t want to have to hand it over to Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, so use the extra time to practice, won’t you?” Professor <PER>Snape</PER> was no less obviously partisan: Professor <PER>Snape</PER> had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s chances; they had, after all, never lost to <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s team.
Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> was still not performing to Wood’s standard, but Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Ron</PER> was working extremely hard to improve.
Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> made a blunder; if Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> let in one goal Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Ron</PER> became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more.
On the other hand, <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Ron</PER> make some truly spectacular saves when <PER>Harry</PER> was on form: During one memorable practice, <PER>Harry</PER> had hung one- handed from <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end.
Even Fred had said that <PER>Ron</PER> might yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously considering admitting that he was related to they, something he assured <PER>Ron</PER> they had been trying to deny for four years.
The only thing really worrying <PER>Harry</PER> was how much <PER>Ron</PER> was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset <PER>Harry</PER> before they even got onto the pitch.
“Warrington’s aim’s so pathetic I’d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,” he retorted, which made <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson’s face.
When <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> imitated <PER>Ron</PER> dropping the Quaffle (which <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> did whenever they were within sight of each other), <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears glowed red and <PER>Ron</PER>’s's hands shook so badly that <PER>Ron</PER>’s was likely to drop whatever <PER>Ron</PER>’s was holding at the time too.
When <PER>Harry</PER> awoke <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed and saw <PER>Harry</PER> sitting bolt upright, <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms around <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, staring fixedly into space.
<PER>Harry</PER> was reminded forcibly of the time that <PER>Ron</PER> had accidentally put a slug- vomiting charm on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked just as pale and sweaty as <PER>Harry</PER> had done then, not to mention as reluctant to open <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to see what was written on the badges as <PER>Harry</PER> walked by, but <PER>Harry</PER> was too concerned to get <PER>Ron</PER> past their table quickly to linger long enough to read their.
“Mental.” “Don’t be thick,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, passing <PER>Harry</PER> a choice of cereals.
“Look at that save you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant — ” <PER>Ron</PER> turned a tortured face to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I didn’t mean to do it — I slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and I was trying to get back on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident.” “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise, “a few more accidents like that and the game’s in the bag, isn’t it?” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> sat down opposite them wearing red-and-gold scarves, gloves, and rosettes.
“How’re you feeling?” <PER>Ginny</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them.
“<PER>Ron</PER>’s just got to have some breakfast.” It became clear after ten minutes, however, that <PER>Ron</PER> was not capable of eating anything more and <PER>Harry</PER> thought it best to get <PER>Harry</PER> down to the changing rooms.
As they rose from the table, <PER>Hermione</PER> got up too, and taking <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm, <PER>Hermione</PER> drew <PER>Harry</PER> to one side.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked questioningly at she, but she shook shis head warningly; <PER>Ron</PER> had just ambled over to them, looking lost and desperate.
“Good luck, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek.
“And you, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to come to <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER> slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall.
He seemed too distracted to notice much around him, but <PER>Harry</PER> cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table, and this time He made out the words etched onto them: With an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried <PER>Ron</PER> across the entrance hall, down the stone steps, and out into the icy air.
<PER>Harry</PER> pointed out these encouraging factors to <PER>Ron</PER> as they walked, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure that <PER>Ron</PER> was listening.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> pulled on their robes (<PER>Ron</PER> attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took pity on him and went to help) and then sat down to listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch.
<PER>Harry</PER> was starting to feel nervous, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER>'s butterflies were as nothing to <PER>Ron</PER>’s, who was clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach and staring straight ahead again, <PER>Harry</PER>'s jaw set and <PER>Harry</PER>'s complexion pale gray.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> stood to one side, the sunlight gleaming on <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s white-blond head.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and smirked, tapping the crown-shaped badge on his chest.
The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upward; out of the corner of his eye <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> streak off toward the goal hoops.
eye <PER>Harry</PER> zoomed higher, dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide lap of the pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other side of the stadium, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was doing exactly the same.
“Just a fun fact, Professor, adds a bit of interest — and she’s ducked Warrington, she’s passed Montague, she’s — ouch — been hit from behind by a Bludger from Crabbe Montague catches the Quaffle, Montague heading back up the pitch and — nice Bludger there from George Weasley, that’s a Bludger to the head for Montague, Montague drops the Quaffle, caught by Katie Bell, Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet’s away — ” Lee Jordan’s commentary rang through the stadium and <PER>Harry</PER> listened as hard as <PER>Harry</PER> could through the wind whistling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears and the din of the crowd, all yelling and booing and singing — “ — dodges Warrington, avoids a Bludger — close call, Alicia — and the crowd are loving this, just listen to the crowd, what’s that they’re singing?” And as Lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands: George Weasley cannot save a thing, George Weasley cannot block a single ring, That’s why Slytherins all sing: George Weasley is our King.
“ — and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as <PER>Harry</PER> swerved, <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides boiling at what <PER>Harry</PER> had just heard, <PER>Harry</PER> knew Lee was trying to drown out the sound of the singing.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help <PER>Harry</PER>: Abandoning <PER>Harry</PER>'s search for the Snitch, <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt toward <PER>Ron</PER>, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch, hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted toward him “ — and it’s Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington heading for goal, he’s out of Bludger range with just the Keeper ahead — ” A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands below: Weasley cannot save a thing, He cannot block a single ring “ — so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, Weasley, brother of Beaters, Fred and George, and a promising new talent on the team — come on, <PER>Ron</PER>!” But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin end: <PER>Ron</PER> had dived wildly, his arms wide, and the Quaffle had soared between them, straight through <PER>Ron</PER>’s central hoop.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” screamed Angelina, soaring past <PER>Harry</PER> to keep up with Katie.
“GET <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER> had been stationary in midair for more than a minute, watching the progress of the match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the Snitch; horrified, <PER>Harry</PER> went into a dive and started circling the pitch again, staring around, trying to ignore the chorus now thundering through the stadium: There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere <PER>Harry</PER> looked; <PER>Malfoy</PER> was still circling the stadium just like <PER>Harry</PER>.
Looking down, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the pug-faced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her back to the pitch as her conducted the Slytherin supporters who were roaring: But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch, a few goals and they would be in the lead as usual, <PER>Harry</PER> assured <PER>Harry</PER>, bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be Montague’s watch strap But <PER>Ron</PER> let in two more goals.
<PER>Harry</PER> ducked a Bludger that Crabbe had sent rocketing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s direction and resumed <PER>Harry</PER>'s frantic scouring of the pitch for the Snitch, keeping one eye on <PER>Malfoy</PER> in case <PER>Harry</PER> showed signs of having spotted it, but <PER>Malfoy</PER>, like <PER>Harry</PER>, was continuing to soar around the stadium, searching fruitlessly “ — Pucey throws to Warrington, Warrington to Montague, Montague back to Pucey — Johnson intervenes, Johnson takes the Quaffle, Johnson to Bell, this looks good — I mean bad — Bell’s hit by a Bludger from Goyle of Slytherin and it’s Pucey in possession again ” But <PER>Harry</PER> had seen it at last: The tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was hovering feet from the ground at the Slytherin end of the pitch.
<PER>Harry</PER> dived In a matter of seconds, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was streaking out of the sky on <PER>Harry</PER>’s left, a green-and-silver blur lying flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom Golden Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops and scooted off toward the other side of the stands; its change of direction suited <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was nearer.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt around, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> were now neck and neck Feet from the ground, <PER>Harry</PER> lifted <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand from <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom, stretching toward broom Golden Snitch to broom Golden Snitch's right, <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s arm extended too, reaching, groping It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds — <PER>Harry</PER>’s fingers closed around the tiny, struggling ball — <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s fingernails scrabbled the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand hopelessly — <PER>Harry</PER> pulled — <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom upward, holding the struggling ball in — <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval They were saved, it did not matter that <PER>Ron</PER> had let in those goals, nobody would remember as long as Gryffindor had won — A Bludger hit <PER>Harry</PER> squarely in the small of the back and <PER>Harry</PER> flew forward off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom; luckily <PER>Harry</PER> was only five or six feet above the ground, having dived so low to catch broom Golden Snitch, but <PER>Harry</PER> was winded all the same as <PER>Harry</PER> landed flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on the frozen pitch.
“He whacked the Bludger at you the moment He saw you’d got the Snitch — but we won, <PER>Harry</PER>, we won!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard a snort from behind <PER>Harry</PER> and turned around, still holding the Snitch tightly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand: <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had landed close by; white-faced with fury, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was still managing to sneer.
“I’ve never seen a worse Keeper but then he was born in a bin Did you like my lyrics, Potter?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer; <PER>Harry</PER> turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one, yelling and punching the air in triumph, all except <PER>Ron</PER>, who had dismounted from <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom over by the goalposts and was making his way slowly back to the changing rooms alone.
“We wanted to write another couple of verses!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> called, as Katie and Alicia hugged <PER>Harry</PER>.
Halfway through shaking <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand they stiffened, looking around at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around for Madam Hooch, but she was still berating Crabbe for <PER>Harry</PER>'s illegal Bludger attack.
“Or perhaps,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, leering as <PER>Harry</PER> backed away, “you can remember what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it — ” <PER>Harry</PER> was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
With no time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s stomach — “<PER>Harry</PER>!
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s nose bloody; George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the background.
<PER>Harry</PER> became aware that something was still struggling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand, the knuckles of which he had bruised against <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s jaw; looking down he saw the Snitch’s silver wings protruding from between his fingers, struggling for release.
“Provoked you?” shouted Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, slamming a fist onto Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s desk so that her tartan biscuit tin slid sideways off her tartan biscuit tin and burst open, littering the floor with Ginger Newts.
“And <PER>Harry</PER>’s mother.” “But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling, did you?” bellowed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER> was standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s resemblance to a giant toad, and smiling in the horribly sickly, ominous way that <PER>Harry</PER> had come to associate with imminent misery.
“May I help, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>?” asked Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> in Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s most poisonously sweet voice.
“Why, I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority.” <PER>Harry</PER> would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s nostrils.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt the Snitch fluttering madly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
Everywhere <PER>Harry</PER> looked there were disconsolate and angry faces; the team themselves were slumped around the fire, all apart from <PER>Ron</PER>, who had not been seen since the end of the match.
Only <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were left beside the fire.
“Have you seen <PER>Ron</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked in a low voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
When He saw <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> He stopped dead in He's tracks.
“Come and sit down!” <PER>Ron</PER> walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from <PER>Harry</PER>’s, not looking at him.
“I’m going to resign first thing tomorrow.” “If you resign,” said <PER>Harry</PER> testily, “there’ll only be three players left on the team.” And when <PER>Ron</PER> looked puzzled, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “I’ve been given a lifetime ban.
<PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> the full story; <PER>Harry</PER> could not bear to tell it again.
When <PER>Hermione</PER> had finished, <PER>Ron</PER> looked more anguished than ever.
“This is all my fault — ” “You didn’t make me punch <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, turning away from the pitch- black, snow-flecked window, a broad smile spreading across <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s back.” <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted up to the boys’ dormitory to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map from <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk; <PER>Harry</PER> was so quick that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were ready to leave at least five minutes before <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried back down from the girls’ dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats.
With a great leap of his heart, <PER>Harry</PER> saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s chimney.
<PER>Harry</PER> set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door; when <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, it’s us!” <PER>Harry</PER> called through the keyhole.
“I just — oh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>).” “It’s nuthin’, it’s nuthin’!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to gaze up at him in horror.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hair was matted with congealed blood, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple-and-black bruises.
“Blimey, it’s good ter see you three again — had good summers, did yeh?” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, you’ve been attacked!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously.
“You’re not going to eat that, are you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, leaning in for a closer look.
“So you have been to look for giants?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning as <PER>Harry</PER> sat down at the table.
“Come on, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, tell us what you’ve been up to!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Tell us about being attacked by the giants and <PER>Harry</PER> can tell you about being attacked by the dementors — ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea, and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as <PER>Hagrid</PER> coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft splat, onto the floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Oh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, don’t, it’s not hygien — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> began, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye.
“You knew where the giants were?” “Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew, an’ he told us,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“But — why couldn’t you just grab a Portkey or something?” There was an odd expression in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s unobscured eye as he squinted at <PER>Ron</PER>; it was almost pitying.
“The Ministry’s keepin’ an eye on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> an’ anyone they reckon’s in league with him, an’ — ” “We know about that,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, keen to hear the rest of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s story.
“We know about the Ministry watching <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ” “So you couldn’t use magic to get there?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, looking thunderstruck.
“You just walked right into a giant camp?” “Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d told us how ter do it,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“It was def’nitely on some of their minds,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, shrugging, “but we did what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told we ter do, which was ter hold we gift up high an’ keep we eyes on the Gurg an’ ignore the others.
“A branch of — ?” “Everlasting fire,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> irritably, “you ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick’s mentioned it at least twice in class!” “Well anyway,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> quickly, intervening before <PER>Ron</PER> could answer back, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn’ somethin’ any wizard could do, an’ so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus’s feet and says, ‘A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who sends his respectful greetings.’ ” “And what did Karkus say?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
“Didn’ speak English.” “You’re kidding!” “Didn’ matter,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> imperturbably, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had warned us tha’ migh’ happen.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted us ter take it very slow,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> allowed him thirty seconds’ reminiscence before clearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat loudly.
“Well that’s not bad — are they going to come over here and start fighting <PER>Voldemort</PER> with us?” But <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “What do you mean ‘at one point,’ <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> looked at her sadly.
“Nope,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak again and applied the cooler side to his face, “but we did wha’ we meant ter do, we gave ’em <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s message an’ some o’ them heard it an’ I ’spect some o’ them’ll remember it.
<PER>Harry</PER> became aware that the knees of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with Fang's head in <PER>Harry</PER>’s lap.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly after a while.
“Mmm?” “Did you was there any sign of did you hear anything about your your mother while you were there?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s unobscured eye rested upon her, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather scared.
<PER>Hermione</PER> glanced nervously at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, plainly wanting them to speak.
“But you still haven’t explained how you got in this state, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, gesturing toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s bloodstained face.
“Get under here!” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak <PER>Harry</PER> whirled the Invisibility Cloak over <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> while <PER>Ron</PER> tore around the table and dived beneath the cloak as well.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, hide our mugs!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang’s basket.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was standing in the doorway wearing Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps.
“Er — I don’ want ter be rude,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, staring at she, “but who the ruddy hell are you?” “My name is Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>.” she eyes were sweeping the cabin.
Twice they stared directly into the corner where <PER>Harry</PER> stood, sandwiched between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, sounding thoroughly confused.
“I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher — ” “Tha’s brave of yeh,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “there’s not many’d take tha’ job anymore — ” “ — and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, giving no sign that she had heard him.
“Precisely what I was going to ask,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been <PER>Hermione</PER>’s mug.
“Oh,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood hidden, “oh, tha’ was was Fang.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> stood facing him now, taking in every detail of <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s appearance instead of the cabin’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gasped; <PER>Harry</PER> clapped a hand over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth.
She passed within two inches of where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood pressed against the wall; <PER>Harry</PER> actually pulled in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach as she walked by.
<PER>Harry</PER> could almost hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain working furiously.
“I see.” “Yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “bit o’ — o’ fresh air, yeh know — “Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> sweetly.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that two of <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth had been knocked out.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> coldly; <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s smile faltered.
Then <PER>Umbridge</PER> hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s arm and said, “I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.” “Righ’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, nodding.
“Oh yes,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> softly, looking back at him with <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s hand on the door handle.
<PER>Harry</PER> made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but <PER>Hermione</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s wrist.
“she might not be gone yet.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> seemed to be thinking the same way; yet.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so.
“Trelawney’s on probation already” “Um what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I don’ want ter spoil the surprise.” “Look, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> urgently, dropping all pretense, “Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> won’t be at all happy if you bring anything to class that’s too dangerous — ” “Dangerous?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking genially bemused.
“But tha’s not very interestin’, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“The stuff I’ve got’s much more impressive, I’ve bin bringin’ ’em on fer years, I reckon I’ve got the on’y domestic herd in Britain — ” “<PER>Hagrid</PER> please ” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, a note of real desperation in her voice.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers <PER>Umbridge</PER> thinks are too close to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Lis’en, it’s bin a long day an’ it’s late,” he said, patting <PER>Hermione</PER> gently on the shoulder, so that <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud.
“Oh — sorry — ” He pulled <PER>Hermione</PER>'s back up by the neck of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes.
“Look, don’ you go worryin’ abou’ me, I promise yeh I’ve got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I’m back Now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an’ don’ forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!” “I dunno if you got through to him,” said <PER>Ron</PER> a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind they due to the Obliteration Charm <PER>Hermione</PER> was performing as they went.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> wanted to go with her, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>'s mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again, so <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grudgingly remained in the common room, trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying students skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing, and worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.
“Gits ” <PER>Hermione</PER> returned from <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s just before lunch, shivering slightly, Gits ” <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes damp to the knees.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly- Plank’s lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small, unbiased part of <PER>Harry</PER> knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Plank’s idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off.
It was with a certain amount of apprehension that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> headed down to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold.
<PER>Harry</PER> was worried, not only about what <PER>Hagrid</PER> might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the class, particularly <PER>Malfoy</PER> and his cronies, would behave if <PER>Umbridge</PER> was watching them.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not understand this: Had <PER>Hagrid</PER> perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing?
As though to complete the ominous picture, Had <PER>Hagrid</PER> was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over Had <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s shoulder.
“What did he say prefers the dark — did you hear?” <PER>Harry</PER> remembered the only occasion on which <PER>Malfoy</PER> had entered the forest before now; <PER>Harry</PER> had not been very brave then either.
<PER>Harry</PER> smiled to <PER>Harry</PER>; after the Quidditch match anything that caused <PER>Malfoy</PER> discomfort was all right with He.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after <PER>Hagrid</PER>, leading the rest of the class.
And then, as <PER>Hagrid</PER> shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest, <PER>Harry</PER> nudged <PER>Ron</PER> and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.
he looked eagerly at <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, “Why doesn’t <PER>Hagrid</PER> call again?” Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as <PER>Ron</PER>’s and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them.
“Now put yer hands up, who can see ’em?” Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“What’s eating it?” “Thestrals,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> proudly and <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a soft “oh!” of comprehension at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“Righ’, now, who can tell me why some o’ you can see them an’ some can’t?” <PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had never heard <PER>Umbridge</PER> ’s fake cough before, was gazing in some concern at the closest thestral, evidently under the impression that it had made the sound.
“You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, in the same loud, slow voice <PER>Umbridge</PER> had used with <PER>Umbridge</PER> earlier, as though <PER>Umbridge</PER> was addressing somebody both foreign and very slow.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on shis clipboard, “ ‘has to resort to crude sign language ” “Well anyway ” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked as though Christmas had come a month early; <PER>Hermione</PER>, on the other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage.
“Oh yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, throwing an uneasy glance at <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s clipboard, but plowing on valiantly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had tears of fury in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes now.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> smiled indulgently at them and then turned to <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Erm,” said <PER>Neville</PER> nervously, with a glance at <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“No!” said <PER>Neville</PER>, looking upset, “no, I’m not scared of them — !” “It’s quite all right,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, patting <PER>Neville</PER> on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile, though it looked more like a leer to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” she turned to look up at him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice, “I think I’ve got enough to be getting along with You will receive” — she mimed taking something from the air in front of shis — “the results of your inspection” — she pointed at the clipboard — “in ten days’ time.” she held up ten stubby little fingers, then, shis smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath shis green hat, she bustled from their midst, leaving <PER>Malfoy</PER> and Pansy Parkinson in fits of laughter, <PER>Hermione</PER> actually shaking with fury, and <PER>Neville</PER> looking confused and upset.
“Well, it’s like <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, they can look after themselves,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> impatiently, “and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn’t usually show them to us before N.E.W.T.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER> — I’m sorry — no, of course I don’t — that was a really stupid thing to say — ” “It’s okay,” he said quickly, “don’t worry” “I’m surprised so many people could see them,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Ignore them, just ignore them,” intoned <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that <PER>Hermione</PER> could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas approached.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s prefect duties were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle (“You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with Peeves,” said <PER>Ron</PER>), to watch over first and second years spending their break times inside because of the bitter cold (“And they’re cheeky little snotrags, you know, we definitely weren’t that rude when we were in first year,” said <PER>Ron</PER>), and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels (“He’s got dung for brains, that one,” said <PER>Ron</PER> furiously).
They were so busy that <PER>Hermione</PER> had stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that <PER>Hermione</PER> was down to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s last three.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was going skiing with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s parents, something that greatly amused <PER>Ron</PER>, who had never before heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down mountains.
<PER>Harry</PER> endured several days of jealousy before <PER>Ron</PER> said, in response to <PER>Harry</PER> asking how <PER>Ron</PER> was going to get home for Christmas, “But you’re coming too!
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Harry</PER> could possibly persuade Molly to invite <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather for the festivities too, but apart from the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> doubted whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place, <PER>Harry</PER> could not help but feel that Mistress Weasley might not want Mistress Weasley; they were so often at loggerheads.
Sirius had not contacted <PER>Harry</PER> at all since <PER>Harry</PER>'s last appearance in the fire, and although <PER>Harry</PER> knew that with <PER>Umbridge</PER> on the constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> did not like to think of Sirius alone in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.
meeting before the holidays and was very glad <PER>Harry</PER> had, because when the lamps burst into light <PER>Harry</PER> saw that Dobby had taken it upon <PER>Harry</PER> to decorate the place for Christmas.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell the elf had done it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and bearing the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!
“These are nice, did you put These up?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “it was Dobby the house-elf.” “Mistletoe,” said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Cho</PER> laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had missed a step going downstairs.
“Well start with the Impediment Jinx, just for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again.” They all divided up obediently; <PER>Harry</PER> partnered <PER>Neville</PER> as usual.
After a while, when <PER>Harry</PER> had unfrozen three times in a row, <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Neville</PER> join <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> again so that <PER>Harry</PER> could walk around the room and watch the others.
When <PER>Harry</PER> passed <PER>Cho</PER> she beamed at <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> resisted the temptation to walk past shis several more times.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> positively swelling with pride as <PER>Harry</PER> watched them all.
Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and stacked them neatly away.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left before he did; he hung back a little, because <PER>Cho</PER> was still there and <PER>Cho</PER> was hoping to receive a Merry Christmas from <PER>Cho</PER>.
Adam’s turned and saw <PER>Cho</PER> standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down <PER>Cho</PER>'s face.
“Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER> wearily, moving toward the door, “I dunno why, nor does anyone else, so it’s nothing to be proud of.” “Oh don’t go!” said <PER>Cho</PER>, sounding tearful again.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a burning desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inability to move <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“Mistletoe,” said <PER>Cho</PER> quietly, pointing at the ceiling over <PER>Cho</PER>'s head.
“I really like you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> could not think.
A tingling sensation was spreading throughout <PER>Harry</PER>, paralyzing <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms, legs, and brain.
He could see every tear clinging to Shis eyelashes He returned to the common room half an hour later to find <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the best seats by the fire; nearly everybody else had gone to bed.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was writing a very long letter; <PER>Hermione</PER> had already filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the edge of the table.
Half of <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> what had just happened, but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, peering at <PER>Harry</PER> over the tip of her quill.
In truth, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know whether <PER>Harry</PER> was all right or not.
“What’s up?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What’s happened?” <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t quite know how to set about telling them, and still wasn’t sure whether <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to.
Just as <PER>Harry</PER> had decided not to say anything, <PER>Hermione</PER> took matters out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
“Is it <PER>Cho</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked in a businesslike way.
“Did <PER>Hermione</PER> corner you after the meeting?” Numbly surprised, <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
<PER>Ron</PER> sniggered, breaking off when <PER>Hermione</PER> caught his eye.
“she — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began, rather hoarsely; <PER>Harry</PER> cleared <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat and tried again.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked from <PER>Ron</PER>’s expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to <PER>Hermione</PER>’s slight frown, and nodded.
A reluctant grin spread over <PER>Harry</PER>’s face as <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Ron</PER> rolling around on the hearthrug.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Ron</PER> a look of deep disgust and returned to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s letter.
“Well?” <PER>Ron</PER> said finally, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Maybe I am.” “Of course you’re not,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> absently, still scribbling away at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s letter.
“Because <PER>Cho</PER> spends half <PER>Cho</PER>'s time crying these days,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the place.” “You’d think a bit of kissing would cheer <PER>Cho</PER>'s up,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her quill into her ink pot, “you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” said <PER>Ron</PER> indignantly.
“What sort of person cries while someone’s kissing them?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, slightly desperately, “who does?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“Don’t you understand how <PER>Cho</PER>’s feeling at the moment?” <PER>Cho</PER> asked.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sighed and laid down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s quill.
“You were, weren’t you?” “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, an unpleasant heat creeping up <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, “I sort of — patted her on the back a bit.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked as though <PER>Hermione</PER> was restraining <PER>Hermione</PER> from rolling <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes with extreme difficulty.
“Oh well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> distantly, buried in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s letter once more, “you’ll have plenty of opportunities to ask <PER>Hermione</PER>” “What if he doesn’t want to ask <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been watching <PER>Harry</PER> with an unusually shrewd expression on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Don’t be silly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely, “<PER>Harry</PER>’s liked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s for ages, haven’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
Yes, <PER>Harry</PER> had liked <PER>Cho</PER> for ages, but whenever <PER>Harry</PER> had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a <PER>Cho</PER> who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a <PER>Cho</PER> who was sobbing uncontrollably into <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
“Who ’re you writing the novel to anyway?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor.
They sat in silence for another twenty minutes, <PER>Ron</PER> finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, <PER>Hermione</PER> writing steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and sealing it, and <PER>Harry</PER> staring into the fire, wishing more than anything that Sirius’s head would appear there and give <PER>Harry</PER> some advice about girls.
“Well, ’night,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, yawning widely, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off up the girls’ staircase.
“What does <PER>Hermione</PER> see in Krum?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded as he and <PER>Harry</PER> climbed the boys’ stairs.
“Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, considering the matter, “I s’pose he’s older, isn’t he and he’s an international Quidditch player” “Yeah, but apart from that,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding aggravated.
“I mean he’s a grouchy git, isn’t he?” “Bit grouchy, yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, whose thoughts were still on <PER>Cho</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster; instead <PER>Harry</PER> stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to <PER>Neville</PER>’s bed.
If he had known, this time last night, that in twenty-four hours’ time he would have kissed <PER>Cho</PER> Chang “ ’Night,” grunted <PER>Ron</PER>, from somewhere to his right.
<PER>Harry</PER> dreamed <PER>Harry</PER> was back in the D.A.
<PER>Cho</PER> was accusing <PER>Cho</PER> of luring <PER>Cho</PER>'s there under false pretenses; <PER>Cho</PER> said that <PER>Cho</PER> had promised <PER>Cho</PER>'s a hundred and fifty <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog cards if <PER>Cho</PER> showed up.
<PER>Harry</PER> protested <PER>Cho</PER> shouted, “ Cedric gave me loads of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog cards, look\” And she pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside her robes and threw them into the air, and then turned into <PER>Hermione</PER>, who said, “You did promise she, you know, <PER>Harry</PER> I think you’d better give shis something else instead How about your Firebolt?” And <PER>Harry</PER> was protesting that <PER>Harry</PER> could not give <PER>Cho</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt because <PER>Umbridge</PER> had it, and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous, he’d only come to the D.A.
he was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone he was flat against the floor, sliding along on his belly It was dark, yet he could see objects around he shimmering in strange, vibrant colors he was turning his head At first glance, the corridor was empty but no a man was sitting on the floor ahead, a man's chin drooping onto a man's chest, his outline gleaming in the dark <PER>Harry</PER> put out <PER>Harry</PER>'s tongue <PER>Harry</PER> tasted the man’s scent on the air <PER>Harry</PER> was alive but drowsing sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor <PER>Harry</PER> longed to bite a man but <PER>Harry</PER> must master the impulse <PER>Harry</PER> had more important work to do But a man was stirring a silvery cloak fell from a man's legs as a man jumped to a man's feet; and <PER>Harry</PER> saw a man's vibrant, blurred outline towering above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt him had no choice him reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging him's fangs deeply into a man’s flesh, feeling him's ribs splinter beneath him's jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood a man was yelling in pain then a man fell silent a man slumped backward against the wall Blood was splattering onto the floor a man forehead hurt terribly It was aching fit to burst “<PER>Harry</PER>!
“<PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Ron</PER> was standing over <PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Ron</PER> looking extremely frightened.
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched <PER>Harry</PER>'s head in his hands; the pain was blinding him <PER>Harry</PER> rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly, “you you were just dreaming” “No!” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously; it was crucial that <PER>Ron</PER> understand.
“<PER>Neville</PER>’s gone for help” “I’m fine!” <PER>Harry</PER> choked, wiping <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas and shaking uncontrollably.
Whether one minute passed or ten, <PER>Harry</PER> did not know; <PER>Harry</PER> simply sat there shaking, feeling the pain recede very slowly from <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar Then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Neville</PER>’s voice again.
“Over here, Professor ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> came hurrying into the dormitory in Professor ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s tartan dressing gown, Professor ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose.
“I’m not lying, and I’m not mad!” <PER>Harry</PER> told her, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice rising to a shout.
“Put on your dressing-gown — we’re going to see the headmaster.” <PER>Harry</PER> was so relieved that she was taking <PER>Harry</PER> seriously that <PER>Harry</PER> did not hesitate, but jumped out of bed at once, pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s dressing gown, and pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses back onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose.
They followed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> past the silent figures of <PER>Neville</PER>, Dean, and Seamus, out of the dormitory, down the spiral stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole, and off along the Fat Lady’s moonlit corridor.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the panic inside <PER>Harry</PER> might spill over at any moment; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to run, to yell for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
They passed Mistress Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said, “Shoo!” Mistress Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few minutes They had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
The door opened of its own accord and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> led <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> inside.
“Oh, it’s you, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and ah.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sitting in a high-backed chair behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple-and-gold dressing gown over a snowy-white nightshirt, but seemed wide awake, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s penetrating light-blue eyes fixed intently upon Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Potter has had a well, a nightmare,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, frowning slightly.
“Very well, then, Potter, you tell the headmaster about it.” ~ “I well, I was asleep” said <PER>Harry</PER> and even in <PER>Harry</PER>'s terror and <PER>Harry</PER>'s desperation to make <PER>Dumbledore</PER> understand <PER>Dumbledore</PER> felt slightly irritated that the headmaster was not looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but examining <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own interlocked fingers.
“But it wasn’t an ordinary dream it was real I saw it happen” He took a deep breath, “<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad — Arthur — has been attacked by a giant snake.” The words seemed to reverberate in the air after <PER>Ron</PER>’s dad — Arthur — had said them, slightly ridiculous, even comic.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, white-faced and shocked.
“How did you see this?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked quietly, still not looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I saw it all from the snake’s point of view” Nobody else spoke for a moment, then <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now looking at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was still whey-faced, said in a new and sharper voice, “Is Arthur seriously injured?” “ Yes” said <PER>Harry</PER> emphatically — why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side?
And why could <PER>Dumbledore</PER> not do <PER>Dumbledore</PER> the courtesy of looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood up so quickly that <PER>Harry</PER> jumped, and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at <PER>Harry</PER> under their eyelids, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked.
“Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts ’s most celebrated Heads,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, now sweeping around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door.
“Please sit down, all three of you,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had not spoken.
“Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, if you could draw up extra chairs ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> pulled Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had conjured back at <PER>Harry</PER>’s hearing.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down, watching <PER>Dumbledore</PER> over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> over <PER>Harry</PER> was now stroking Fawkes’s plumed golden head with one finger.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function <PER>Harry</PER> had never known, carried it over to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk, sat down facing them again, and tapped it gently with the tip of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> watched the smoke closely, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s brow furrowed, and after a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air A serpent’s head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether the instrument was confirming <PER>Harry</PER>'s story: <PER>Harry</PER> looked eagerly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a sign that <PER>Harry</PER> was right, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not look up.
“Naturally, naturally,” murmured <PER>Dumbledore</PER> apparently to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise.
With a look of grim satisfaction <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave the instrument another gentle tap with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand: The clinking noise slowed and died, and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze, and vanished.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table; <PER>Harry</PER> saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow <PER>Harry</PER> with the old headmasters in the portraits's eyes, then, realizing that <PER>Harry</PER> was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “What news?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> at once.
“Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.” “Of course” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> got up and moved swiftly to the door; <PER>Harry</PER> cast a sideways glance at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was now looking terrified.
“And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — what about Molly?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, pausing at the door.
“But she may already know that excellent clock of hers ” <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was referring to the clock that told, not the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family members, and with a pang he thought that Arthur’s hand must, even now, be pointing at “mortal peril.” But it was very late Molly was probably asleep, not watching the clock And he felt cold as he remembered Molly’s boggart turning into Mister Weasley’s lifeless body, his glasses askew, blood running down his face But Arthur wasn’t going to die Arthur couldn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was now rummaging in a cupboard behind <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> marched over to another portrait, this time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s voice when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> attempted to rouse him.
“Oh no, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I am too tired tonight” Something about Phineas ’s voice was familiar to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Dereliction of duty!” “We are honor-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts!” cried a frail-looking old wizard whom <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s predecessor, Armando Dippet.
“Oh, very well,” said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod slightly apprehensively, “though he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he’s done most of the family — ” “Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized immediately where <PER>Harry</PER> had heard Phineas ’s voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom in Grimmauld Place.
“You are to give <PER>Harry</PER> the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that Arthur Weasley's wife, children, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter will be arriving at <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's house shortly.
Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were ushered inside by Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, all three of them looking disheveled and shocked, still in them's night things.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — what’s going on?” asked <PER>Ginny</PER>, who looked frightened.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> says you saw Dad hurt — ” “Your father has been injured in the course of Your father's work for the Order of the Phoenix,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> before <PER>Harry</PER> could speak.
“My great-great-grandson has always had odd taste in houseguests” “Come here, then,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER> and the Weasleys.
“And quickly, before anyone else joins us <PER>Harry</PER> and the others gathered around <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk.
At once, <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again — and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within <PER>Harry</PER> a hatred so powerful <PER>Harry</PER> felt, for that instant, that <PER>Harry</PER> would like nothing better than to strike — to bite — to sink <PER>Harry</PER>'s fangs into the man before him — “ three.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a powerful jerk behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s navel, the ground vanished from beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand was glued to the kettle; <PER>Harry</PER> was banging into the others as all sped forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling them onward and then — <PER>Harry</PER> feet hit the ground so hard that <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said, “Back again, the blood traitor brats, is it true the blood traitor brats's father’s dying “OUT!” roared a second voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and looked around; they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
“It was — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began; this was even worse than telling <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I had a — a kind of — vision” And <PER>Harry</PER> told them all that <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, though <PER>Harry</PER> altered the story so that it sounded as though <PER>Harry</PER> had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake’s own eyes <PER>Ron</PER>, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not speak.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> continued to stare at <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know whether <PER>Harry</PER> was imagining it or not, but <PER>Harry</PER> fancied there was something accusatory in their looks.
Well, if they were going to blame <PER>Harry</PER> for just seeing the attack, <PER>Harry</PER> was glad <PER>Harry</PER> had not told them that <PER>Harry</PER> had been inside the snake at the time “Is Mum here?” said Fred, turning to Sirius.
<PER>Ginny</PER> said, “Somebody else could have told us us could have heard it somewhere other than <PER>Harry</PER>” “Like who?” said Sirius impatiently.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>, who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug, and they sat down too.
<PER>Harry</PER> was only drinking to have something to do with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
I felt like I wanted to attack <PER>Dumbledore</PER> too <PER>Dumbledore</PER> put the bottle down on the table a little harder than <PER>Dumbledore</PER> meant to, so that the bottle slopped over onto the table.
If <PER>Harry</PER> had ever sat through a longer night than this one <PER>Harry</PER> could not remember it.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open; <PER>Harry</PER> could see them reflecting the firelight.
Mistress Weasley was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at Mistress Weasley, Fred, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> half-rising from their chairs, Mistress Weasley gave a wan smile.
George and <PER>Ginny</PER> got up, walked swiftly over to George and <PER>Ginny</PER>'s mother, and hugged her.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to intrude upon the Weasleys’ happiness, and <PER>Harry</PER> dreaded the moment when Molly would ask <PER>Harry</PER> to recount <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision.
However, <PER>Harry</PER> had barely taken plates from the dresser when Molly lifted them out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into a hug.
Without preamble <PER>Harry</PER> told preamble <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather every detail of the vision preamble <PER>Harry</PER> had had, including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Mister Weasley.
When he paused for breath, Sirius said, “Did you tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> this?” “Yes,” said preamble <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, “but preamble <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t tell me what it meant.
“Sirius, I I think I’m going mad Back in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office, just before we took the Portkey for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one — my scar really hurt when I was looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — Sirius, I wanted to attack him — ” him could only see a sliver of “Sirius’s face; the rest was in darkness.
“You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and — ” “It wasn’t that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> went up to the bedroom <PER>Harry</PER> had shared with <PER>Ron</PER> over the summer, but while <PER>Ron</PER> crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, <PER>Harry</PER> sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping <PER>Harry</PER> deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that <PER>Harry</PER> might become the serpent again in <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleep and awake to find that <PER>Harry</PER> had attacked <PER>Ron</PER>, or else slithered through the house after one of the others When <PER>Ron</PER> woke up, <PER>Harry</PER> pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> sensed the concealed eye staring hard at <PER>Harry</PER>; trying to deflect more questions about <PER>Harry</PER>'s dream <PER>Harry</PER> asked Mad-Eye where St. Mungo’s was hidden.
He pushed <PER>Harry</PER> a little ahead of <PER>Harry</PER> and stumped along just behind; <PER>Harry</PER> knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat.
“Everybody ready?” They nodded, clustering around her; Moody gave <PER>Harry</PER> another shove between the shoulder blades to urge <PER>Harry</PER> forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy and said, her breath steaming up the glass, “Wotcher We’re here to see Arthur Weasley.” For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the very ugly dummy to hear her talking that quietly through a sheet of glass, when there were buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER> that dummies could not hear anyway.
Fred, George, and <PER>Ron</PER> stepped after them; <PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd.’s, nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them.
<PER>Harry</PER> drew back too, but Molly reached out a hand and pushed <PER>Harry</PER> through the door, saying, “Don’t be silly, <PER>Harry</PER>, Arthur wants to thank you” The ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pleased and relieved to see that <PER>Harry</PER> was propped up on several pillows and reading the Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around as they walked toward <PER>Harry</PER> and, seeing whom it was, beamed.
“ — got — er — me,” “Arthur said hastily, though <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure that was not what <PER>Harry</PER> had meant to say.
For a few seconds <PER>Harry</PER> could hear nothing, then <PER>Harry</PER> heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside <PER>Harry</PER>. "
“You know, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seems almost to have been waiting for <PER>Harry</PER> to see something like this” “Yeah, well,” said Moody, “there’s something funny about the Potter kid, we all know that.” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed worried about <PER>Harry</PER> when I spoke to <PER>Harry</PER> this morning,” whispered Molly.
“The boy’s seeing things from inside You-Know- Who’s snake Obviously, Potter doesn’t realize what that means, but if You- Know- Who’s possessing him — ” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Extendable Ear out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
Was this why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would no longer meet <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes?
Did <PER>Dumbledore</PER> expect to see <PER>Voldemort</PER> staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that them's vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils?
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered how the snakelike face of <PER>Voldemort</PER> had once forced itself out of the back of Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s head, and <PER>Harry</PER> ran his hand over the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, wondering what it would feel like if <PER>Voldemort</PER> burst out of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s skull <PER>Voldemort</PER> felt dirty, contaminated, as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not merely seen the snake, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been the snake, <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew it now And then a truly terrible thought occurred to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, a memory bobbing to the surface of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s mind, one that made <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s insides writhe and squirm like serpents “What’s he after apart from followers?” “Stuff he can only get by stealth like a weapon.
I’m the one <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s trying to use, that’s why they’ve got guards around me everywhere I go, it’s not for my protection, it’s for other people’s, only it’s not working, they can’t have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts I did attack Arthur last night, it was me, <PER>Voldemort</PER> made me do it and <PER>Voldemort</PER> could be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now “Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear?” whispered Mistress Weasley, leaning across <PER>Ginny</PER> to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel.
Perhaps he was an Animagus No, he couldn’t be, he would know perhaps <PER>Voldemort</PER> was an Animagus Yes, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, that would fit, <PER>Harry</PER> would turn into a snake of course and when <PER>Harry</PER>’s possessing me, then we both transform That still doesn’t explain how come I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes, though But then <PER>Voldemort</PER>’ s about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, it’s probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that And then, with a terrible stab of panic he thought, but this is insane — if <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s possessing me, I’m giving <PER>Voldemort</PER> a clear view into the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now!
Phineas Nigellus had appeared upon the canvas of Phineas Nigellus's portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching <PER>Harry</PER> with an amused expression on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Not running away, no,” said <PER>Harry</PER> shortly, dragging <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk a few more feet across the room.
“This is no cowardly flight — you are being noble.” <PER>Harry</PER> ignored <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, “I have a message for you from Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> spun around.
“What is it?” “Stay where you are.” “I haven’t moved!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand still upon the doorknob.
<PER>Harry</PER> was exhausted, <PER>Harry</PER> was confused beyond measure, <PER>Harry</PER> had experienced terror, relief, and then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not want to talk to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!
Fuming, <PER>Harry</PER> dragged <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk back to the foot of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, then threw <PER>Harry</PER> facedown upon the moth-eaten covers, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes shut, <PER>Harry</PER>'s body heavy and aching <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> had journeyed miles and miles It seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago <PER>Cho</PER> Chang had been approaching <PER>Harry</PER> under the mistletoe <PER>Harry</PER> was so tired <PER>Harry</PER> was scared to sleep yet <PER>Harry</PER> did not know how long <PER>Harry</PER> could fight it <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> to stay That must mean <PER>Harry</PER> was allowed to sleep But <PER>Harry</PER> was scared What if it happened again ?
<PER>Harry</PER> was sinking into shadows It was as though a film in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head had been waiting to start.
He was walking down a deserted corridor toward a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway onto a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left He reached the black door but could not open the black door He stood gazing at the black door, desperate for entry Something He wanted with all He's heart lay beyond A prize beyond his dreams If only his scar would stop prickling then he would be able to think more clearly “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice, from far, far away, “Mum says dinner’s ready, but dinner’s’ll save you something if you want to stay in bed” <PER>Harry</PER> opened his eyes, but <PER>Ron</PER> had already left the room.
Not after what <PER>Harry</PER> heard Moody say <PER>Harry</PER> supposed none of them would want <PER>Harry</PER> there anymore now that them knew what was inside <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> would not go down to dinner; <PER>Harry</PER> would not inflict <PER>Harry</PER>'s company upon them.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned over onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s other side and after a while dropped back off to sleep, waking much later in the early hours of the morning, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides aching with hunger, and <PER>Ron</PER> snoring in the next bed.
Squinting around the room <PER>Harry</PER> saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in <PER>Harry</PER>'s portrait and it occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had probably set Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case him attacked somebody else.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; <PER>Harry</PER> was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that <PER>Harry</PER> was to have company over Christmas.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice echoing up through the floor in the cold and empty drawing room where <PER>Harry</PER> was sitting alone, watching the sky outside the windows growing whiter, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that <PER>Harry</PER> was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about <PER>Harry</PER>, as they were bound to be doing.
When <PER>Harry</PER> heard Molly calling <PER>Harry</PER>'s name softly up the stairs around lunchtime <PER>Harry</PER> retreated farther upstairs and ignored Molly.
Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, <PER>Harry</PER> merely settled <PER>Harry</PER> more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak the hippogriff’s room where <PER>Harry</PER> was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry <PER>Harry</PER> felt as <PER>Harry</PER> fed Buckbeak dead rats.
“So I’ve come for Christmas.” There was snow in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face was pink with cold.
When him entered the bedroom him was rather surprised to see both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> waiting for them, sitting on <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed.
“I came on the Knight Bus,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> airily, pulling off <PER>Hermione</PER>'s jacket before <PER>Harry</PER> had time to speak.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> say you’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. Mungo’s.” “They do, do They?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glaring at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked down at his feet but <PER>Ginny</PER> seemed quite unabashed.
“Well, that was a bit stupid of you,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> angrily, “seeing as you don’t know anyone but me who’s been possessed by <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and I can tell you how it feels.” <PER>Harry</PER> remained quite still as the impact of these words hit <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m sorry,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER> meant it.
“Are there big blank periods where you don’t know what you’ve been up to?” <PER>Harry</PER> racked <PER>Harry</PER>'s brains.
“Then <PER>Voldemort</PER> hasn’t ever possessed you,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> simply.
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve had these dreams before,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said.
“You had flashes of what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was up to last year.” “This was different,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart swelled with happiness and relief, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past their door toward Buckbeak’s room, singing “God Rest Ye Merry, Hippogriffs” at the top of his voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now <PER>Harry</PER> seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more, than themselves would have done at Hogwarts, and <PER>Harry</PER> worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with themselves's help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable.
<PER>Harry</PER> awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and <PER>Ron</PER> already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.
“Thanks for the Broom Compass, it’s excellent, beats <PER>Hermione</PER>’s — <PER>Hermione</PER>’s got me a homework planner — ” <PER>Harry</PER> sorted through <PER>Harry</PER>'s presents and found one with <PER>Hermione</PER>’s handwriting on it.
<PER>Harry</PER> flicked through the first volume eagerly; <PER>Harry</PER> could see it was going to be highly useful in <PER>Harry</PER>'s plans for the D.A.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately prevented <PER>Harry</PER> putting any money in without getting <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers ripped off.
Tonks’s present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which <PER>Harry</PER> watched fly around the room, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> still had <PER>Harry</PER>'s full-size version; <PER>Ron</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> an enormous box of Every-Flavor Beans; Mister and Molly the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies; and Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that <PER>Harry</PER> suspected had been done by the elf himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just turned it upside down to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER>'s new homework diary at <PER>Harry</PER>; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily, “If you’ve dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s then you may do whatever you pleasel” They got up and dressed; They could hear various inhabitants of the house calling “Merry Christmas” to each other.
“So, this is Kreacher’s bedroom?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry which <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen open.
“They can leave the house if They really want to,” <PER>Harry</PER> contradicted <PER>Harry</PER>.
Once they had had their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were planning to pay Arthur another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin.
<PER>Harry</PER> and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them; <PER>Harry</PER> and the others strolled casually toward the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass.
It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, although halfway across the room <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> shunted aside by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril.
“It was just — just something Pye and I thought we’d try — only, most unfortunately — well, with these particular kinds of wounds — it doesn’t seem to work as well as we’d hoped — ” “Meaning?” “Well well, I don’t know whether you know what — what stitches are?” “It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back together,” said Molly with a snort of mirthless laughter, “but even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be that stupid — ” “I fancy a cup of tea too,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, jumping to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> almost sprinted to the door with him.
As it swung closed behind them, them heard Molly shriek, “WHAT DO YOU MEAN, “Typical Dad,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, shaking <PER>Ginny</PER>'s head as they set off up the corridor.
“I expect you’d like my autograph, would you?” “Hasn’t changed much, has he?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ginny</PER>, who grinned.
It had been <PER>Ron</PER>’s malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart’s memory so badly that he had landed here in the first place, though, as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s memories at the time, <PER>Harry</PER>’s sympathy was limited.
For a few moments he gazed intently at <PER>Harry</PER>, then he said, “Haven’t we met?” “Er yeah, we have,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“This is our long-term resident ward,” she informed <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> in a low voice.
“You can put them in envelopes,” he said to <PER>Ginny</PER>, throwing the signed pictures into <PER>Ginny</PER>'s lap one by one as he finished them.
Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; <PER>Harry</PER> remembered something similar happening to <PER>Hermione</PER> during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s case, had not been permanent.
<PER>Harry</PER> cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that <PER>Neville</PER> could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned, but <PER>Ron</PER> had looked up at the sound of the name “Longbottom” too, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER> had called, “<PER>Neville</PER>\” <PER>Neville</PER> jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s us, <PER>Neville</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> brightly, getting to his feet.
<PER>Neville</PER> looked as though <PER>Neville</PER> would rather be anywhere in the world but here.
“Ah, yes,” said his grandmother, looking closely at <PER>Harry</PER> and sticking out a shriveled, clawlike hand for <PER>Harry</PER> to shake.
<PER>Neville</PER> did not look at <PER>Neville</PER>, but stared at <PER>Neville</PER>'s own feet, the color deepening in <PER>Neville</PER>'s face all the while.
“And you two are clearly Weasleys,” Mistress Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> in turn.
“Yes, I know your parents — not well, of course — but fine people, fine people and you must be <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather startled that Mistress Longbottom knew Mistress Longbottom's name, but shook hands all the same.
“What?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking amazed (<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to stamp on <PER>Ron</PER>’s foot, but that sort of thing was much harder to bring off unnoticed when you were wearing jeans rather than robes).
“Haven’t you told your friends about your parents, <PER>Neville</PER>?” <PER>Neville</PER> took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling, and shook <PER>Neville</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not think of any way of helping <PER>Neville</PER> out of the situation.
“My son and his wife,” she said, turning haughtily to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, “were tortured into insanity by You-Know- Who’s followers.” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> both clapped their hands over their mouths.
<PER>Ron</PER> stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents and looked mortified.
“Very well, Alice dear, very well — <PER>Neville</PER>, take it, whatever it is” But <PER>Neville</PER> had already stretched out <PER>Neville</PER>'s hand, into which <PER>Neville</PER>'s mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper.
<PER>Neville</PER> looked around at the others, <PER>Neville</PER>'s expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not think <PER>Harry</PER>’d ever found anything less funny in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> told me but I promised I wouldn’t mention it that’s what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents until they lost their minds.” “Bellatrix Lestrange did that?” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, horrified.
Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on Kreacher's reappearance, Kreacher's bitter muttering had subsided somewhat, and Kreacher submitted to orders more docilely than usual, though once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> caught the house-elf staring avidly at Kreacher, always looking quickly away when Kreacher saw that <PER>Harry</PER> had noticed.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not mention <PER>Harry</PER>'s vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over.
In fact, for the first time in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, <PER>Harry</PER> was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts.
Going back to school would mean placing <PER>Harry</PER> once again under the tyranny of Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence.
Then there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned; there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> remained as remote as ever; in fact, if it had not been for the D.A., <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> might have gone to Sirius and begged <PER>Harry</PER> to let <PER>Harry</PER> leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place.
Then, on the very last day of the holidays, something happened that made <PER>Harry</PER> positively dread <PER>Harry</PER>'s return to school.
“<PER>Harry</PER> dear,” said Molly, poking Molly's head into his and <PER>Ron</PER>’s bedroom, where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Crookshanks, “could you come down to the kitchen?
He looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, all of whom were gaping back at him.
“<PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> blankly.
“You haven’t done anything, have you?” “No!” said <PER>Harry</PER> indignantly, racking <PER>Harry</PER>'s brains to think what <PER>Harry</PER> could have done that would make <PER>Snape</PER> pursue <PER>Harry</PER> to Grimmauld Place.
Had <PER>Harry</PER> pushed open the kitchen door a minute or two later to find Sirius and <PER>Snape</PER> both seated at the long kitchen table, glaring in opposite directions.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked around at <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>'s face framed between curtains of greasy black hair.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down in a chair beside Sirius, facing <PER>Snape</PER> across the table.
“I am here on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s orders,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, whose voice, by contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, “but by all means stay, Black, I know you like to feel involved.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” said Sirius, letting his chair fall back onto all four legs with a loud bang.
<PER>Snape</PER> ’s lip curled in triumph as he turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the horrible sensation that <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides were melting.
Extra lessons with <PER>Snape</PER> — what on earth had <PER>Snape</PER> done to deserve this?
“Why can’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> teach <PER>Harry</PER>?” asked Sirius aggressively.
He was rather taller than <PER>Snape</PER> who, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, had balled He's fist in the pocket of his cloak over what <PER>Harry</PER> was sure was the handle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“If I hear you’re using these Occlumency lessons to give <PER>Harry</PER> a hard time, you’ll have me to answer to.” “How touching,” <PER>Snape</PER> sneered.
Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table toward <PER>Snape</PER>, pulling out his wand as his went; <PER>Snape</PER> whipped out <PER>Snape</PER>'s own.
“Sirius!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, but “Sirius appeared not to hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’ve warned you, Snivellus,” said Sirius, his face barely a foot from <PER>Snape</PER> ’s, “I don’t care if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thinks you’ve reformed, I know better — ” “Oh, but why don’t you tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> so?” whispered <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Or are you afraid <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mother’s house for six months very seriously?” “Tell me, how is Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> these days?
“NO!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them, “Sirius, don’t — ” “Are you calling me a coward?” roared Sirius, trying to push <PER>Harry</PER> out of the way, but <PER>Harry</PER> would not budge.
“Completely cured!” he and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and <PER>Snape</PER> looking toward the door with their wands pointing into each other’s faces and <PER>Harry</PER> immobile between them, a hand stretched out to each of them, trying to force them apart.
“Merlin’s beard,” said Arthur, the smile sliding off his face, “what’s going on here?” Both Sirius and <PER>Snape</PER> lowered Both Sirius and <PER>Snape</PER>'s wands.
<PER>Snape</PER> pocketed <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand and swept back across the kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment.
Sirius glared after <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand at his side.
That night’s meal should have been a cheerful one with Arthur back amongst them; <PER>Harry</PER> could tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather was not forcing <PER>Harry</PER> to laugh loudly at Fred and George’s jokes or offering everyone more food, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face fell back into a moody, brooding expression.
<PER>Harry</PER> was separated from <PER>Harry</PER> by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Arthur their congratulations; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> should not listen to a word <PER>Snape</PER> said, that <PER>Snape</PER> was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them did not think Sirius was a coward for doing as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> and remaining in Grimmauld Place, but <PER>Harry</PER> had no opportunity to do so, and wondered occasionally, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius’s face, whether <PER>Harry</PER> would have dared to even if <PER>Harry</PER> had the chance.
Instead <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants to stop you having those dreams about <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
“Well, you won’t be sorry not to have them anymore, will you?” “Extra lessons with <PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding aghast.
“I’d rather have the nightmares!” They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived there next morning.
<PER>Harry</PER> had an unpleasant constricted sensation in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest; <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to say good-bye to Sirius.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a bad feeling about this parting; <PER>Harry</PER> did not know when they would next see each other and felt that it was incumbent upon <PER>Harry</PER> to say something to Sirius to stop <PER>Harry</PER> doing anything stupid — <PER>Harry</PER> was worried that <PER>Snape</PER>’s accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly — <PER>Harry</PER> might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place.
Before — <PER>Harry</PER> could think of what to say, however, Sirius had beckoned — <PER>Harry</PER> to — <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
“I doubt Molly would approve — but I want you to use it if you need me, all right?” “Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, stowing the package away in the inside pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> would never use whatever it was.
It would not be he, <PER>Harry</PER>, who lured Sirius from his place of safety, no matter how foully <PER>Snape</PER> treated <PER>Snape</PER> in their forthcoming Occlumency classes.
“Let’s go, then,” said Sirius, clapping <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder and smiling grimly, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could say anything else, they were heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door, surrounded by Weasleys.
his said gruffly, “Look after yourself, <PER>Harry</PER>,” and next moment <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> being shunted out into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall, tweedy woman with iron-gray hair) chivvying <PER>Harry</PER> down the steps.
“On, on, get on — And she shoved <PER>Harry</PER> forward toward the steps, past the conductor, who goggled at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> passed.
“I’ve always wanted to go on this thing,” said <PER>Ron</PER> happily, joining <PER>Harry</PER> on board and looking around.
“Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, if you just take those seats at the back Remus can stay with you” She, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> proceeded up to the very top deck, where there were two chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back.
Stan Shunpike, the conductor, followed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> eagerly to the back.
Heads turned as <PER>Harry</PER> passed and when <PER>Harry</PER> sat down, <PER>Harry</PER> saw all the faces flick back to the front again.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> handed Stan eleven Sickles each, the bus set off again, swaying ominously.
It rumbled around Grimmauld Square, weaving on and off the pavement, then, with another tremendous BANG, they were all flung backward; <PER>Ron</PER>’s chair toppled right over and Pigwidgeon, who had been on his lap, burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down upon <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder instead.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket, looked out of the window: <PER>Harry</PER>, who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway.
“Just outside Birmingham,” said Stan happily, answering <PER>Harry</PER>’s unasked question as <PER>Ron</PER> struggled up from the floor.
Looking toward the front of the bus <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> cover her eyes with her hands, Pigwidgeon still swaying happily on her shoulder.
“And listen ” <PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice while the rest of them exchanged last-minute good-byes with Tonks, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I know you don’t like <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Snape</PER> is a superb Occlumens and we all — Sirius included — want you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right?” “Yeah, all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> heavily, looking up into Lupin’s prematurely lined face.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced back when they reached the oak front doors; the Knight Bus had already gone, and <PER>Harry</PER> half-wished, given what was coming the following day, that <PER>Harry</PER> was still on board.
<PER>Harry</PER> morning Potions lesson did nothing to dispel <PER>Harry</PER>'s trepidation, as <PER>Snape</PER> was as unpleasant as ever, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s mood was further lowered by the fact that members of the D.A.
“I’ll let you know when the next one is,” <PER>Harry</PER> said over and over again, “but I can’t do it tonight, I’ve got to go to — er — Remedial Potions” “You take Remedial Potions?” asked Zacharias Smith superciliously, having cornered <PER>Harry</PER> in the entrance hall after lunch.
“Good Lord, you must be terrible, <PER>Snape</PER> doesn’t usually give extra lessons, does <PER>Snape</PER>?” As Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion, <PER>Ron</PER> glared after him.
“Oh,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach leapt uncomfortably.
“Hi.” “We’ll be in the library, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> firmly, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seized <PER>Ron</PER> above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble staircase.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood staring after her, <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain working frantically.
“Right well that’s settled then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all, <PER>Harry</PER> headed off to the library to pick up <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> before their afternoon lessons, walking in a rather bouncy way himself.
By six o’clock that evening, however, even the glow of having successfully asked out <PER>Cho</PER> Chang was insufficient to lighten the ominous feelings that intensified with every step <PER>Harry</PER> took toward <PER>Snape</PER>’s office.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused outside the door when <PER>Harry</PER> reached the door, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> were almost anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, knocked, and entered.
In a corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that <PER>Snape</PER> had once accused <PER>Harry</PER> — not without reason — of robbing.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized it at once — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve.
Wondering what on earth it was doing here, <PER>Harry</PER> jumped when <PER>Snape</PER>’s cold voice came out of the corner.
“Shut the door behind you, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> did as <PER>Harry</PER> was told with the horrible feeling that <PER>Harry</PER> was imprisoning <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> did so.
When <PER>Harry</PER> turned back to face the room <PER>Snape</PER> had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down and so did <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon <PER>Harry</PER>, dislike etched in every line of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, his eyes narrowed malevolently, “but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ‘sir’ or ‘Professor’ at all times.” “Yes sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked back at <PER>Snape</PER> for a moment and then said contemptuously, “Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter?
“But why does Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> want to stop it?” Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked abruptly.
“It appears that <PER>Voldemort</PER> has been unaware of the connection between you and <PER>Voldemort</PER> until very recently.
“As I was saying the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts — ” “I saw inside the snake’s head, not his!” “I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter?” But <PER>Harry</PER> did not care if <PER>Snape</PER> was angry; at <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business.
<PER>Harry</PER> had moved forward in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair so that, without realizing it, <PER>Harry</PER> was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts I’m sharing?” “Do not say <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name\” spat <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s name,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is an extremely powerful wizard,” <PER>Snape</PER> muttered.
“While <PER>Snape</PER> may feel secure enough to use the name the rest of us ” <PER>Snape</PER> rubbed <PER>Snape</PER>'s left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where <PER>Harry</PER> knew the Dark Mark was burned into <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin.
“I just wanted to know,” <PER>Harry</PER> began again, forcing <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice back to politeness, “why — ” “You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was at that particular moment,” snarled <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too” “And Vol — he — realized I was there?” “It seems so,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coolly.
“Is this just Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> guessing, or — ?” “I told you,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, rigid in his chair, his eyes slits, “to call me ‘sir.’ ” “Yes, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, “but how do you know — ?” “It is enough that we know,” said <PER>Snape</PER> repressively.
“The important point is that <PER>Voldemort</PER> is now aware that you are gaining access to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s thoughts and feelings.
“Which brings us back to Occlumency.” <PER>Snape</PER> pulled out <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand from an inside pocket of his robes and <PER>Harry</PER> tensed in his chair, but <PER>Snape</PER> merely raised the wand to <PER>Snape</PER>'s temple and placed his temple tip into the greasy roots of <PER>Snape</PER>'s hair.
When <PER>Snape</PER> withdrew it, some silvery substance came away, stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand, which broke as <PER>Snape</PER> pulled the wand away from the wand and fell gracefully into the Pensieve, where it swirled silvery white, neither gas nor liquid.
Twice more <PER>Snape</PER> raised the wand to <PER>Snape</PER>'s temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin, then, without offering any explanation of his behavior, his picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed the Pensieve to a shelf out of their way and returned to face <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held at the ready.
“Stand up and take out your wand, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet feeling nervous.
“And what are you going to do?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, eyeing <PER>Snape</PER> ’s wand apprehensively.
“To whom did the dog belong?” “My Aunt Marge,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, hating <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, raising <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand once more.
“Now, I want you to close your eyes.” <PER>Harry</PER> threw him a filthy look before doing as <PER>Harry</PER> was told.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not like the idea of standing there with <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes shut while <PER>Snape</PER> faced him, carrying a wand.
“Let go of all emotion” But <PER>Harry</PER>’s anger at <PER>Snape</PER> continued to pound through <PER>Harry</PER>’s's veins like venom.
his could as easily detach his legs “You’re not doing it, Potter You will need more discipline than this Focus, now” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, tried not to think, or remember, or feel “Let’s go again on the count of three one — two — three — Legilimensl” A great black dragon was rearing in front of him him father and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him him was on his knees again, him's face buried in him's hands, him's brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from him's skull.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked paler than usual, and angrier, though not nearly as angry as <PER>Harry</PER> was.
“Then you will find yourself easy prey for <PER>Voldemort</PER>!” said <PER>Snape</PER> savagely.
It looked as though, this time, <PER>Snape</PER> had lifted the spell before <PER>Harry</PER> had even tried to fight back.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not answer at once; <PER>Harry</PER> was still savoring the moment of blinding realization as <PER>Harry</PER> rubbed <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead <PER>Harry</PER> had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months, without once realizing that it was a real place.
Now, seeing the memory again, <PER>Harry</PER> knew that all along <PER>Harry</PER> had been dreaming about the corridor down which <PER>Harry</PER> had run with Arthur on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry.
“What’s in the Department of Mysteries?” “What did you say?” <PER>Snape</PER> asked quietly and <PER>Harry</PER> saw, with deep satisfaction, that <PER>Snape</PER> was unnerved.
“And why,” said <PER>Snape</PER> slowly, “would you ask such a thing?” “Because,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching <PER>Snape</PER> closely for a reaction, “that corridor I’ve just seen — I’ve been dreaming about it for months — I’ve just recognized it — it leads to the Department of Mysteries and I think <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants something from — ” “I have told you not to say <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name\” They glared at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s scar seared again, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not care.
When <PER>Snape</PER> spoke again <PER>Snape</PER> sounded as though <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to appear cool and unconcerned.
“There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, few of which you would understand and none of which concern you, do I make myself plain?” “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, still rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s prickling scar, which was becoming more painful.
He was desperate to get out of <PER>Snape</PER> ’s office and find <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s schoolbag, swung it over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, and hurried toward the office door.
As he opened it he glanced back at <PER>Snape</PER>, who had his back to <PER>Harry</PER> and was scooping <PER>Harry</PER>'s own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head.
<PER>Harry</PER> left without another word, closing the door carefully behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar still throbbing painfully.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the library, where they were working on <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s most recent ream of homework.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt shivery; <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar was still aching, <PER>Harry</PER> felt almost feverish.
When <PER>Harry</PER> sat down opposite <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER> in the window opposite.
“How did it go?” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, and then, looking concerned, “Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yeah fine I dunno,” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, wincing as pain shot through <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar again.
“Listen I’ve just realized something” And <PER>Harry</PER> told them what <PER>Harry</PER> had just seen and deduced.
“So so, are you saying ” whispered <PER>Ron</PER>, as Madam Pince swept past, squeaking slightly, “that the weapon — the thing You-Know- Who’s after — is in the Ministry of Magic?” “In the Department of Mysteries, it’s got to be,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, think about it Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic It must have been that one, it’s too much of a coincidence!” “How come Sturgis was trying to break in when Sturgis’s on our side?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“That is a bit odd” “So what’s in the Department of Mysteries?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect <PER>Harry</PER>, are you sure you’re all right?” For <PER>Harry</PER> had just run both <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands hard over <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead as though trying to iron it.
“How do those hats work, then?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, distracted from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s homework and watching Fred and George.
“So you don’t forget!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged looks as <PER>Harry</PER> reached into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, withdrew the planner and opened's bag tentatively.
“ Don’t leave it till later, you big second-rateri” chided the book as <PER>Harry</PER> scribbled down <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s homework.
“I think 111 go to bed,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, stuffing the homework planner back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity <PER>Harry</PER> got.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried to put a Headless Hat on <PER>Harry</PER>, and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys’ dormitories.
<PER>Harry</PER> was feeling sick again, just as <PER>Harry</PER> had the night <PER>Harry</PER> had had the vision of the snake, but thought that if <PER>Harry</PER> could just lie down for a while <PER>Harry</PER> would be all right.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened the door of <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory and was one step inside it when <PER>Harry</PER> experienced pain so severe <PER>Harry</PER> thought that someone must have sliced into the top of someone's head.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know where <PER>Harry</PER> was, whether <PER>Harry</PER> was standing or lying down, <PER>Harry</PER> did not even know <PER>Harry</PER>'s own name Maniacal laughter was ringing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears <PER>Harry</PER> was happier than <PER>Harry</PER> had been in a very long time Jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant A wonderful, wonderful thing had happened “<PER>Harry</PER>?
The moment he realized this, it died away; <PER>Harry</PER> lay panting on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead throbbing horribly.
<PER>Ron</PER> was bending over <PER>Harry</PER>, looking very worried.
“He’s really happy really happy ” “<PER>Voldemort</PER> is?” “Something good’s happened,” mumbled <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was shaking as badly as <PER>Harry</PER> had done after seeing the snake attack Arthur and felt very sick.
“Something <PER>Harry</PER>’s been hoping for.” The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking them through <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth, yet <PER>Harry</PER> knew them were true.
<PER>Harry</PER> took deep breaths, willing <PER>Harry</PER> not to vomit all over <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> told me to come and check on you,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a low voice, helping <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“She says your defenses will be low at the moment, after <PER>Snape</PER>’s been fiddling around with your mind Still, I suppose it’ll help in the long run, won’t it?” He looked doubtfully at <PER>Harry</PER> as He helped him toward bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> nodded without any conviction and slumped back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillows, aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar still prickling painfully.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help feeling that <PER>Harry</PER>'s first foray into Occlumency had weakened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind’s resistance rather than strengthening it, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered, with a feeling of great trepidation, what had happened to make Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> the happiest Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been in fourteen years.
When <PER>Hermione</PER>’s Daily Prophet arrived <PER>Hermione</PER>’s Daily Prophet smoothed it out, gazed for a moment at the front page, and then gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
Her face had leapt out at <PER>Harry</PER> the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the page.
<PER>Hermione</PER> nudged <PER>Harry</PER> and pointed at the headline over the pictures, which <PER>Harry</PER>, concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read.
“That’s why he was happy last night” “I don’t believe this,” snarled <PER>Harry</PER>, “Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius?” “What other options does he have?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> bitterly.
“he can hardly say, ‘Sorry everyone, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> warned me this might happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’ — stop whimpering, <PER>Ron</PER> — ‘and now <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s worst supporters have broken out too.’ I mean, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s spent a good six months telling everyone you and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> are liars, hasn’t <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s?” <PER>Hermione</PER> ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while <PER>Harry</PER> looked around the Great Hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not understand why <PER>Harry</PER>'s fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of fellow students took the newspaper every day like <PER>Hermione</PER>.
There they all were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish, and outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s ranks <PER>Voldemort</PER> glanced up at the staff table.
It was a different story here: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave.
She scowled as She gulped down Shis food and every now and then She shot a malevolent glance up the table to where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>McGonagall</PER> were talking so intently.
<PER>Hermione</PER> folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it back to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“To send a letter,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, swinging <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag onto <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoulder.
“It well, I don’t know whether but it’s worth trying and I’m the only one who can “I hate it when she does that,” grumbled <PER>Ron</PER> as he and <PER>Harry</PER> got up from the table and made their own, slower way out of the Great Hall.
“Are you okay, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, following <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> lumbered after the Ravenclaws.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> go, wondering how much more bad news <PER>Harry</PER> could stand.
The fact that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days, but to <PER>Harry</PER>’s indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> prominent among them, seemed positively gleeful.
As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St. Mungo’s, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be the only people who knew or cared.
Those who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s; the crimes they had committed during the days of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s reign of terror were legendary.
It was true that <PER>Harry</PER> was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers’ voices.
They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophet’s version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of Azkaban fortress.
In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them, the one that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been expounding since the previous year.
“their obviously can’t talk freely in the staffroom anymore,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low voice, as she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> passed Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day.
“Not with <PER>Umbridge</PER> there.” “Reckon they know anything new?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers.
<PER>Harry</PER> had thought that the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled <PER>Umbridge</PER> a little, that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under shis beloved Fudge’s nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought that Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain; several times <PER>Harry</PER> passed her in the corridors (in itself a very unusual occurrence as her generally remained in her tower room), muttering wildly to her, wringing her hands, and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder, all the time giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry.
If he had not been so worried about <PER>Hagrid</PER>, he would have felt sorry for her — but if one of them was to be ousted out of a job, there could be only one choice for <PER>Harry</PER> as to who should remain.
Unfortunately, <PER>Harry</PER> could not see that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was putting up a better show than Trelawney.
he was also more distant with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> than he had ever been before, expressly forbidding them to visit he after dark.
It seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Umbridge</PER> was steadily depriving <PER>Harry</PER> of everything that made <PER>Harry</PER>'s life at Hogwarts worth living: visits to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house, letters from Sirius, his Firebolt, and Quidditch.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in <PER>Neville</PER>.
his had not once mentioned his meeting with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> on the closed ward in St. Mungo’s, and taking their lead from him, their had kept quiet about it too.
meetings anymore, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and countercurse <PER>Harry</PER> taught them, <PER>Harry</PER>'s plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents, working harder than anyone else in the room.
He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when <PER>Harry</PER> taught them the Shield Charm, a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that them rebounded upon the attacker, only <PER>Hermione</PER> mastered the charm faster than <PER>Neville</PER>.
In fact <PER>Harry</PER> would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as <PER>Neville</PER> was making during D.A.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s sessions with <PER>Snape</PER>, which had started badly enough, were not improving; on the contrary, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> was getting worse with every lesson.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts or moods that <PER>Voldemort</PER> experienced every now and then.
Nowadays, however, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to <PER>Voldemort</PER> at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had the horrible impression that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mood, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was sure <PER>Voldemort</PER> could date this increased sensitivity firmly from <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s first Occlumency lesson with <PER>Snape</PER>.
What was more, <PER>Voldemort</PER> was now dreaming about walking down the corridor toward the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams that always culminated in <PER>Voldemort</PER> standing longingly in front of the plain black door.
“Maybe it’s a bit like an illness,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking concerned when <PER>Harry</PER> confided in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t have asked <PER>Snape</PER> to teach you Occlumency.
“You try it sometime, <PER>Snape</PER> trying to get inside your head, it’s not a bundle of laughs, you know!” “Maybe ” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly.
“Maybe it’s not <PER>Harry</PER>’s fault <PER>Harry</PER> can’t close <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind,” said <PER>Ron</PER> darkly.
“Well, maybe <PER>Snape</PER> isn’t really trying to help <PER>Harry</PER>” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Maybe,” he said again in a lower voice, “he’s actually trying to open <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind a bit wider make it easier for You-Know — ” “Shut up, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily.
“And we’ve never seen proof that he really swapped sides” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts him,” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated.
<PER>Harry</PER> had had very little time to spare on conversations with <PER>Cho</PER> since they had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found <PER>Harry</PER> facing a Valentine’s Day spent entirely in <PER>Cho</PER>'s company.
“Listen, <PER>Harry</PER>,” she said, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Cho</PER> might be expecting me to spend the whole day with <PER>Cho</PER>.
“Are you coming?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> shook his head, looking glum.
<PER>Harry</PER> found it very hard to be sympathetic to <PER>Ron</PER>’s plight when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed to notice <PER>Harry</PER>’s tone, because <PER>Harry</PER> did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said good-bye to each other shortly afterward.
<PER>Ron</PER> departed for the Quidditch pitch and <PER>Harry</PER>, after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the entrance hall to meet <PER>Cho</PER>, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s feet seemed to be too big for <PER>Harry</PER>’s's body as <PER>Harry</PER>’s walked toward She, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s was suddenly horribly aware of <PER>Harry</PER>’s's arms and how stupid they looked swinging at <PER>Harry</PER>’s's sides.
It was a fresh, breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium, <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> skimming over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them “You really miss it, don’t you?” said <PER>Cho</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her, no more difficult, in fact, than talking to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson.
“Urgh, Chang, I don’t think much of your taste At least Diggory was good-looking!” They sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER>, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake.
<PER>Harry</PER> could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and <PER>Cho</PER>, slightly flushed, was watching <PER>Cho</PER>'s feet.
They moved aside when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER> approached and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> staring once more at the ten pictures of the escaped Death Eaters.
It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft’s; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck.
<PER>Harry</PER> was reminded unpleasantly of <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office.
The sight made <PER>Harry</PER> feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the tea shop, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that it was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands.
Perhaps <PER>Cho</PER> would expect <PER>Cho</PER> to hold <PER>Cho</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished they wouldn’t; <PER>Harry</PER> felt that Roger Davies was setting a standard with which <PER>Cho</PER> would soon expect <PER>Harry</PER> to compete.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up <PER>Harry</PER> could not see the street outside.
To postpone the moment when <PER>Harry</PER> had to look at <PER>Cho</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub.
After a few more painful minutes <PER>Cho</PER> mentioned <PER>Umbridge</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing <PER>Cho</PER>, but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during D.A.
A few more minutes passed in total silence, <PER>Harry</PER> drinking <PER>Harry</PER>'s coffee so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> would soon need a fresh cup.
<PER>Cho</PER>’s hand was lying on the table beside her coffee, and <PER>Harry</PER> was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it.
Just do it, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
Just reach out and grab it Amazing how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair But just as he moved his hand forward, <PER>Cho</PER> took <PER>Cho</PER> off the table.
<PER>Cho</PER> was now watching Roger Davies kissing <PER>Cho</PER>'s girlfriend with a mildly interested expression.
“I’ve been meaning to ask you for ages Did Cedric — did he m-m-mention me at all before he died?” This was the very last subject on earth <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to discuss, and least of all with <PER>Cho</PER>.
“Well — I have talked about it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said in a whisper, “to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, but — ” “Oh, you’ll talk to <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger!” she said shrilly, shis face now shining with tears, and several more kissing couples broke apart to stare.
“<PER>Cho</PER>?” <PER>Cho</PER>?
“I don’t know why you asked me out in the first place if you’re going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me How many are you meeting after <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “It’s not like that!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that <PER>Harry</PER> laughed, which <PER>Harry</PER> realized a split second too late was a mistake.
<PER>Cho</PER> sprang to <PER>Cho</PER>'s feet.
“<PER>Cho</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle.
“Hi, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Hagrid</PER>!
<PER>Hagrid</PER> jumped and looked down at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER> barely recognized <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> had two fresh cuts on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face and several new bruises.
“Oh, it’s you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“You all righ’?” “Yeah, I’m fine,” lied <PER>Harry</PER>; in fact, next to this battered and mournful-looking <PER>Hagrid</PER>, he felt he did not have much to complain about.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what to say to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then <PER>Hagrid</PER> said abruptly, “In the same boat, you an’ me, aren’ we, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Er — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, unable to stop <PER>Harry</PER>, “where are you getting all these injuries?” “Eh?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking startled.
“Wha’ injuries?” “All those!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing at <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face.
“Oh tha’s jus’ normal bumps an’ bruises, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> dismissively.
“I’ll be seein’yeh, <PER>Harry</PER> Take care now” And <PER>Harry</PER> lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and then disappeared into the torrential rain.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> go, feeling miserable.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was unhappy and <PER>Harry</PER> was hiding something, but <PER>Harry</PER> seemed determined not to accept help.
But before <PER>Harry</PER> could think about the matter any further, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a voice calling <PER>Harry</PER>'s name.
He was still a few tables away when He realized that <PER>Hermione</PER> was not alone; <PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates He could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, ex- journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s least favorite people in the world.
“I thought you were with <PER>Cho</PER>, I wasn’t expecting you for another hour at least!” “<PER>Cho</PER>?” said <PER>Rita</PER> at once, twisting around in <PER>Cho</PER>'s seat to stare avidly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“A girl?” <PER>Cho</PER> snatched up <PER>Cho</PER>'s crocodile-skin handbag and groped within crocodile-skin handbag.
“It’s none of your business if <PER>Harry</PER>’s been with a hundred girls,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Rita</PER> coolly.
“So you can put that away right now.” <PER>Rita</PER> had been on the point of withdrawing an acid- green quill from <PER>Rita</PER>'s bag.
Looking as though <PER>Rita</PER> had been forced to swallow Stinksap, <PER>Rita</PER> snapped <PER>Rita</PER>'s bag shut again.
“What are you up to?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, sitting down and staring from <PER>Rita</PER> to Luna to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,” said <PER>Rita</PER>, taking a large slurp of <PER>Rita</PER>'s drink.
her took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth, “Pretty girl, is she, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “One more word about <PER>Harry</PER>’s love life and the deal’s off and that’s a promise,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> irritably.
“What deal?” said <PER>Rita</PER>, wiping <PER>Rita</PER>'s mouth on the back of <PER>Rita</PER>'s hand.
“Yes, yes, one of these days you’ll write more horrible stories about <PER>Harry</PER> and me,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> indifferently.
“Find someone who cares, why don’t you?” “They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about <PER>Harry</PER> this year without my help,” said <PER>Rita</PER>, shooting a sideways look at <PER>Harry</PER> over the top of <PER>Rita</PER>'s glass and adding in a rough whisper, “How has that made you feel, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Because <PER>Harry</PER>’s told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister’s too much of an idiot to believe him.” “So you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named is back?” said <PER>Rita</PER>, lowering <PER>Rita</PER>'s glass and subjecting <PER>Harry</PER> to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag.
“You stand by all this garbage <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s been telling everybody about You- Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness “I wasn’t the sole witness,” snarled <PER>Harry</PER>.
“A great bold headline: ‘Potter Accuses ’A subheading: ‘<PER>Harry</PER> Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us.’ And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you: ‘Disturbed teenage survivor of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s attack, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, 1 5, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the Wizarding community of being Death Eaters’ ” The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression died out of her face.
“But of course,” her said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Little Miss Perfect wouldn’t want that story out there, would her?” “As a matter of fact,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sweetly, “that’s exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.” <PER>Rita</PER> stared at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“You want me to report what he says about He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named?” <PER>Rita</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> in a hushed voice.
<PER>Rita</PER> blotted the front of <PER>Rita</PER>'s grubby raincoat, still staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Rita</PER> gave <PER>Hermione</PER> a long, hard look.
Then, leaning forward across the table toward <PER>Rita</PER>, <PER>Rita</PER> said in a businesslike tone, “All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing.
<PER>Rita</PER> sat up straight again, <PER>Rita</PER>'s eyebrows raised, and drained <PER>Rita</PER>'s glass of firewhisky.
“They do it because it’s an honor, and, of course, to see They's names in print.” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m supposed to do this for free?” “Well, yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> calmly, taking a sip of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s drink.
“Okay, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, turning to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Ready to tell the public the truth?” “I suppose,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching <PER>Rita</PER> balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them.
“Fire away, then, <PER>Rita</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> serenely, fishing a cherry out of the bottom of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s glass.
Luna said vaguely that Luna did not know how soon <PER>Rita</PER>’s interview with <PER>Harry</PER> would appear in The Quibbler, that Luna's father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when <PER>Voldemort</PER> had returned.
<PER>Rita</PER> had pressed <PER>Harry</PER> for every little detail, and <PER>Harry</PER> had given <PER>Rita</PER>'s everything him could remember, knowing that this was him's one big opportunity to tell the world the truth.
But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given <PER>Harry</PER> a burning desire to do something, whether it worked or not “Can’t wait to see what <PER>Umbridge</PER> thinks of you going public,” said Dean, sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night.
Seamus was shoveling down large amounts of chicken-and-ham pie on Dean’s other side, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was listening.
“It’s the right thing to do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, who was sitting opposite him.
him was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, “It must have been tough talking about it Was it?” “Yeah,” mumbled <PER>Harry</PER>, “but people have got to know what <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s capable of, haven’t people?” “That’s right,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, nodding, “and his Death Eaters too People should know” <PER>Neville</PER> left <PER>Neville</PER>'s sentence hanging and returned to <PER>Neville</PER>'s baked potato.
After a while Dean, Seamus, and <PER>Neville</PER> departed for the common room, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> at the table waiting for <PER>Ron</PER>, who had not yet had dinner because of Quidditch practice.
<PER>Cho</PER> Chang walked into the hall with <PER>Cho</PER> Chang's friend Marietta.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach gave an unpleasant lurch, but <PER>Cho</PER> Chang did not look over at the Gryffindor table and sat down with <PER>Cho</PER> Chang's back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Oh, I forgot to ask you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> brightly, glancing over at the Ravenclaw table, “what happened on your date with <PER>Cho</PER>?
so then,” he finished several minutes later, as the final bit of crumble disappeared, “<PER>Hermione</PER> jumps up, right, and says ‘111 see you around, <PER>Harry</PER>,’ and runs out of the place!” <PER>Harry</PER> put down <PER>Harry</PER>'s spoon and looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“One minute we were getting on fine, next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked shis out, and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid tea shop — how was I supposed to feel about that?” “Well, you see,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with the patient air of one explaining that one plus one equals two to an overemotional toddler, “you shouldn’t have told shis that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date.” “But, but,” spluttered <PER>Harry</PER>, “but — you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that without telling shis — ?” “You should have told shis differently” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, still with that maddeningly patient air.
“You should have said it was really annoying, but I’d made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn’t want to go, you’d much rather spend the whole day with <PER>Hermione</PER>, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would <PER>Hermione</PER> please, please come along with you, and hopefully you’d be able to get away more quickly?
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re worse than <PER>Ron</PER> Well, no, you’re not,” she sighed, as <PER>Ron</PER> himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy.
“Look — you upset <PER>Cho</PER> when you said you were going to meet me, so <PER>Cho</PER> tried to make you jealous.
“Well, wouldn’t it have been easier if <PER>Cho</PER>’d just asked me whether I liked <PER>Cho</PER>'s better than you?” “Girls don’t often ask questions like that,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Then I could’ve just told her I fancy her, and her wouldn’t have had to get her all worked up again about Cedric dying!” “I’m not saying what her did was sensible,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ginny</PER> joined them, just as muddy as <PER>Ron</PER> and looking equally disgruntled.
“I’m just trying to make you see how her was feeling at the time.” “You should write a book,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> as he cut up his potatoes, “translating mad things girls do so boys can understand girls.” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table.
<PER>Cho</PER> had just got up; still not looking at <PER>Cho</PER>, <PER>Cho</PER> left the Great Hall.
Feeling rather depressed, <PER>Cho</PER> looked back at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Oh come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking at <PER>Ginny</PER>, “I’m sure it wasn’t that — ” “Yes, it was,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> not here?” asked Fred, looking around as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled up a chair and, when <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Good.
“Well — that’d explain it.” “Has <PER>Ron</PER> saved a goal yet?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms.
“That’s the trouble with Quidditch,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> absentmindedly, once again bent over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Rune translation, “it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the Houses.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up to find her copy of Spellman’s Syllabary and caught Fred, George, and <PER>Harry</PER> looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces.
“It’s only a game, isn’t it?” “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking his head, “you’re good on feelings and stuff, but you just don’t understand about Quidditch.” “Maybe not,” she said darkly, returning to shis translation again, “but at least my happiness doesn’t depend on <PER>Ron</PER>’s goalkeeping ability.” And though <PER>Harry</PER> would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her, by the time <PER>Harry</PER> had watched the game the following Saturday <PER>Harry</PER> would have given any number of Galleons not to care about Quidditch either.
It was hard to say what the worst thing was: <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was a close-run contest between <PER>Ron</PER>’s fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backward off Kirke's broom as Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle.
“Good catch,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ginny</PER> back in the common room, where the atmosphere closely resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral.
“Angelina still won’t let him resign,” <PER>Ginny</PER> said, as though reading <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind.
“Angelina says Angelina knows <PER>Harry</PER>’s got it in <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in <PER>Ron</PER>, but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team.
Out of respect for <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings, <PER>Harry</PER> waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself, so that <PER>Ron</PER> could pretend to be asleep if <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to.
Sure enough, when <PER>Harry</PER> finally entered the room <PER>Ron</PER> was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible.
He was quite impressed by <PER>Ginny</PER>’s performance but He felt that if He had been playing He could have caught the Snitch sooner There had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke’s ankle; if she hadn’t hesitated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had been sitting a few rows below <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
he tried for a moment or two, but the thought of <PER>Snape</PER> on top of memories of <PER>Umbridge</PER> merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment, and he found he focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them.
It took <PER>Harry</PER> much longer to get to sleep; <PER>Harry</PER>'s body was tired, but it took <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain a long time to close down.
<PER>Harry</PER> dreamed that <PER>Neville</PER> and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> played the bagpipes.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched them happily for a while, then decided to go and find the other members of the D.A But when <PER>Harry</PER> left the room <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> facing, not the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head slowly to the left.
He had the strangest feeling that this time He was going to get lucky at last, and find the way to open it He was feet from it and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right-hand side The door was ajar He stretched out He's hand to push it wide and — <PER>Ron</PER> gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore, and <PER>Harry</PER> awoke abruptly with <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand stretched in front of <PER>Harry</PER> in the darkness, to open a door that was hundreds of miles away.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> should not have seen the door, but at the same time, felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that <PER>Harry</PER> could not help feeling annoyed with <PER>Ron</PER> If <PER>Harry</PER> could have saved <PER>Harry</PER>'s snore for just another minute k k k They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on Monday morning.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was not the only person eagerly awaiting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Daily Prophet: Nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many reported sightings, had still not been caught.
She gave the delivery owl a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to orange juice; as <PER>Harry</PER> had only received one note during the entire year <PER>Harry</PER> was sure, when the first owl landed with a thud in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, that it had made a mistake.
“Who ’re you after?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked it, languidly removing <PER>Harry</PER>'s orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forward to see the recipient’s name and address: <PER>Harry</PER> Potter Great Hall Hogwarts School Frowning, <PER>Harry</PER> made to take the letter from the owl, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could do so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside its beak and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter, knocking over the salt, and each attempting to give he three, four, five more owls's letters first.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly, plunging <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both started ripping open envelopes.
“Says you don’t come across as a mad person, but he really doesn’t want to believe You-Know- Who’s back so he doesn’t know what to think now Blimey, what a waste of parchment ” “Here’s another one you’ve convinced, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> excitedly.
“ ‘Having read your side of the story I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly Little though I want to think that <PER>Voldemort</PER> has returned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth’ Oh this is wonderful!” “Another one who thinks you’re barking,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder, “but this one says you’ve got her converted, and her now thinks you’re a real hero — her’s put in a photograph too — wow — ” “What is going on here?” said a falsely sweet, girlish voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands full of envelopes.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was standing behind Fred and Luna, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s bulging toad’s eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, Potter?” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, but Potter?” did not see how Potter?” could keep what Potter?” had done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s attention.
he had the strangest feeling that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been watching <PER>Dumbledore</PER> a second before, but when he looked, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick.
Signed: Dolores Jane <PER>Umbridge</PER> For some reason, every time <PER>Hermione</PER> caught sight of one of these signs <PER>Hermione</PER> beamed with pleasure.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, don’t you see?” <PER>Hermione</PER> breathed.
By the end of that day, though <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school, the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview at each other; <PER>Harry</PER> heard them whispering about it as them queued up outside classes, discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons, while <PER>Hermione</PER> even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls’ toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before Ancient Runes.
“And then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, so they were bombarding me with questions,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes shining, “and <PER>Harry</PER>, I think they believe you, I really do, I think you’ve finally got they convinced!” Meanwhile Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was stalking the school, stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets.
Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when <PER>Harry</PER> passed her a watering can; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on <PER>Harry</PER> at the end of Charms, said “Shh\” and hurried away; and Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving <PER>Umbridge</PER>, that <PER>Harry</PER> was not going to suffer an early death after all, but would live to a ripe old age, become Minister of Magic, and have twelve children.
But what made <PER>Harry</PER> happiest was <PER>Cho</PER> catching up with <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Cho</PER> was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day.
them looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> browsed the shelves for the book <PER>Harry</PER> needed on Partial Vanishment, and Goyle cracked <PER>Harry</PER>'s knuckles threateningly and <PER>Malfoy</PER> whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: <PER>Harry</PER> had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters.
“He can’t believe it, He says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple- Horned Snorkacks!” <PER>Harry</PER> was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night; daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like “The Ministry are morons” and “Eat dung, <PER>Umbridge</PER>” in a booming voice.
<PER>Hermione</PER> did not find this very amusing; <PER>Hermione</PER> said it interfered with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s concentration, and ended up going to bed early out of irritation.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like “Dung” and “<PER>Umbridge</PER>” at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> relinquished <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip upon the chair and walked around the chair, closer to the man cowering upon the floor, until he stood directly over he in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual.
“Yes, My Lord, yes I used to work in the department after — after all” “Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.” Bode could never have taken it, Bode would have known Bode could not Undoubtedly that is why Bode fought so hard against <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s Imperius Curse” “Stand up, Rookwood,” whispered <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> flailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings, and fell out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
For a few seconds <PER>Harry</PER> did not know where <PER>Harry</PER> was; <PER>Harry</PER> was convinced that <PER>Harry</PER> was about to see the white, skull-like face looming at him out of the dark again, then <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice spoke very near to him.
“Will you stop acting like a maniac, and I can get you out of here!” <PER>Ron</PER> wrenched the hangings apart, and <PER>Harry</PER> stared up at him in the moonlight, as him lay flat on him's back, him's scar searing with pain.
“Has someone been attacked again?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> roughly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“But Rookwood’s going to help <PER>Harry</PER> now <PER>Harry</PER>’s on the right track again” “What are you talking about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding scared.
“D’you mean did you just see You-Know- Who?” “I was <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands in the darkness and held them up to <PER>Harry</PER>'s face to check that them were no longer deathly white and long-fingered.
“But — <PER>Harry</PER>, that’s got to be — ” “The weapon,” <PER>Harry</PER> finished the sentence for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs back into bed.
“Did you say,” murmured <PER>Ron</PER>, putting his head close to <PER>Harry</PER>’s on the pretense of helping himself to water from the jug on himself's bedside table, “that you were You- Know-Who?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw it spill over <PER>Harry</PER>'s chin onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off their robes, and talking, “you’ve got to tell — ” “I haven’t got to tell anyone,” said <PER>Harry</PER> shortly.
He got back into bed and rolled over onto He's side with He's back to <PER>Ron</PER> and after a while He heard <PER>Ron</PER>’s mattress creak as <PER>Ron</PER>’s lay back down too.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s scar began to burn; <PER>Ron</PER>’s bit hard on <PER>Ron</PER>’s's pillow to stop <PER>Ron</PER>’s making a noise.
Somewhere, he knew, Avery was being punished <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> waited until break next morning to tell <PER>Hermione</PER> exactly what had happened.
Standing in They's usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard, <PER>Harry</PER> told her every detail of the dream <PER>Harry</PER> could remember.
“And now Rookwood’s told <PER>Voldemort</PER> how to get the weapon?” “I didn’t hear all the conversation, but that’s what it sounded like,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Rookwood used to work there Maybe <PER>Voldemort</PER>’ll send Rookwood to do it?” <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded, apparently still lost in thought.
Then, quite abruptly, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “But you shouldn’t have seen this at all, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “What?” he said, taken aback.
“And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on.” <PER>Harry</PER> was so angry with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s that <PER>Harry</PER> did not talk to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s for the rest of the day, which proved to be another bad one.
The week did not improve as it progressed: <PER>Harry</PER> received two more D’s in Potions, was still on tenterhooks that <PER>Hagrid</PER> might get the sack, and could not stop <PER>Harry</PER> from dwelling on the dream in which <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Voldemort</PER>, though <PER>Harry</PER> did not bring it up with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> again because <PER>Harry</PER> did not want another telling-off from <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished very much that <PER>Harry</PER> could have talked to Sirius about it, but that was out of the question, so <PER>Harry</PER> tried to push the matter to the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
“Get up, Potter.” A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, <PER>Harry</PER> was to be found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of <PER>Snape</PER>’s office, trying to clear <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very early memories <PER>Harry</PER> had not even realized <PER>Harry</PER> still had, most of them concerning humiliations <PER>Dudley</PER> and He's gang had inflicted upon him in primary school.
“What was it?” “I don’t know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, getting wearily to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s dark eyes bored into <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
Remembering what <PER>Snape</PER> had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and looked away.
“It — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking everywhere but at <PER>Snape</PER>, “it was — just a dream I had.” “A dream,” repeated <PER>Snape</PER>.
“That is just as well, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, “because you are neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what <PER>Voldemort</PER> is saying to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s Death Eaters.” “No — that’s your job, isn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER> shot at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not meant to say it; it had burst out of <PER>Harry</PER> in temper.
For a long moment they stared at each other, <PER>Harry</PER> convinced <PER>Harry</PER> had gone too far.
But there was a curious, almost satisfied expression on <PER>Snape</PER>’s face when <PER>Snape</PER> answered.
“Yes, Potter,” <PER>Snape</PER> said, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes glinting.
“One — two — three — LegilimensV’ A hundred dementors were swooping toward <PER>Harry</PER> across the lake in the grounds <PER>Harry</PER> screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s face in concentration They were coming closer <PER>Harry</PER> could see the dark holes beneath They's hoods yet <PER>Harry</PER> could also see <PER>Snape</PER> standing in front of <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes fixed upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, muttering under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath And somehow, <PER>Snape</PER> was growing clearer, and the dementors were growing fainter <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand.
One of the jars behind <PER>Harry</PER> had broken when <PER>Harry</PER> fell against the jars behind <PER>Harry</PER>; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in the jars behind him draining potion.
“Well, Potter that was certainly an improvement” Panting slightly, <PER>Snape</PER> straightened the Pensieve in which <PER>Snape</PER> had again stored some of <PER>Snape</PER>'s thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though checking that they were still there.
“I don’t remember telling you to use a Shield Charm but there is no doubt that it was effective” <PER>Harry</PER> did not speak; <PER>Harry</PER> felt that to say anything might be dangerous.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> had just broken into <PER>Snape</PER>’s memories, that <PER>Harry</PER> had just seen scenes from <PER>Snape</PER>’s childhood, and it was unnerving to think that the crying little boy who had watched <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents shouting was actually standing in front of <PER>Harry</PER> with such loathing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes “Let’s try again, shall we?” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a thrill of dread: <PER>Harry</PER> was about to pay for what had just happened, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure of it.
They moved back into position with the desk between They, <PER>Harry</PER> feeling <PER>Harry</PER> was going to find it much harder to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind this time “On the count of three, then,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, raising his wand once more.
“One — two — ” <PER>Harry</PER> did not have time to gather <PER>Harry</PER> together and attempt to clear <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, for <PER>Snape</PER> had already cried “ Legilimens\” Legilimens\ was hurtling along the corridor toward the Department of Mysteries, past the blank stone walls, past the torches — the plain black door was growing ever larger; Legilimens\ was moving so fast Legilimens\ was going to collide with Legilimens\, Legilimens\ was feet from Legilimens\ and Legilimens\ could see that chink of faint blue light again — the plain black door had flown open!
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> was flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back again with no memory of having gotten there; <PER>Harry</PER> was also panting as though <PER>Harry</PER> really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor, really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room “Explain yourself!” said <PER>Snape</PER>, who was standing over him, looking furious.
There was a lump on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head from where <PER>Harry</PER> had hit the ground and <PER>Harry</PER> felt feverish.
“You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “Can you tell me something, sir?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, firing up again.
“Why do you call <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER>, I’ve only ever heard Death Eaters call <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER> that — ” <PER>Snape</PER> opened <PER>Snape</PER>'s mouth in a snarl — and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s head jerked upward; <PER>Snape</PER>’s was gazing at the ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear a muffled commotion coming from what <PER>Harry</PER> thought might be the entrance hall.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked around at <PER>Snape</PER>, frowning.
“Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter?” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Snape</PER> strode to <PER>Snape</PER>'s office door, his wand still held at the ready, and swept out of sight.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the top <PER>Harry</PER> found the entrance hall packed.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was directly opposite <PER>Harry</PER> on the other side of the hall; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked as though what Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was watching made Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s feel faintly sick.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard a sob to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left and looked around.
“There, there, Sibyll Calm down Blow your nose on this It’s not as bad as you think, now You are not going to have to leave Hogwarts” “Oh really, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> in a deadly voice, taking a few steps forward.
“Yours, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> with a singularly unpleasant little laugh.
“Might I ask you to escort Sibyll back upstairs, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>?” “Of course,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“This is Firenze,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> happily to a thunderstruck <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“Not really,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet “I’ve never really liked horses.” <PER>Hermione</PER> turned a page of the newspaper, scanning its columns.
“She can’t get any worse than She’s been already.” “You mark my words, She’s going to want revenge on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for appointing a new teacher without consulting her,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, closing the newspaper.
When <PER>Harry</PER> entered it right behind <PER>Ron</PER>, and found himself right in the middle of a forest clearing, <PER>Harry</PER> was therefore momentarily stunned.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” he said, holding out a hand when <PER>Harry</PER> entered.
“Er — hi,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking hands with the centaur, who surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile.
As <PER>Harry</PER> turned to join the rest of the class upon the floor, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they were all looking at <PER>Harry</PER> with awe, apparently deeply impressed that <PER>Harry</PER> was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom they seemed to find intimidating.
“They see this as a betrayal of our kind.” <PER>Harry</PER> remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing <PER>Harry</PER> to ride to safety upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, calling <PER>Harry</PER> a “common mule.” <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest.
“And is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind.” <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head very slightly to look at Parvati.
“Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,” continued Firenze, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard the swishing of <PER>Harry</PER>'s tail again as <PER>Harry</PER> walked up and down before them, “but she wastes shis time, in the main, on the self- P a g e ?
“I mean, I could do with a few more details about this war we’re about to have, couldn’t you?” The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped; <PER>Harry</PER> had completely forgotten that they were still inside the castle, quite convinced that <PER>Harry</PER> was really in the forest.
The class filed out, looking slightly perplexed; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were on the point of following them when Firenze called, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, a word, please.” <PER>Harry</PER> turned.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, you are a friend of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, are you not?” said the centaur.
“I would warn <PER>Hagrid</PER> myself, but I am banished — it would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now — <PER>Hagrid</PER> has troubles enough, without a centaurs’ battle.” “But — what’s <PER>Hagrid</PER> attempting to do?” said <PER>Harry</PER> nervously.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze’s warning to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Because you’ve got to be careful, <PER>Umbridge</PER> has already sacked Trelawney and if you ask me, <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s on a roll.
“Don’ worry abou’ me, <PER>Harry</PER>, jus’ get along now, there’s a good lad” <PER>Harry</PER> had no choice but to leave <PER>Hagrid</PER> mopping up the dung all over <PER>Harry</PER>'s floor, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt thoroughly dispirited as <PER>Harry</PER> trudged back up to the castle.
lessons, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> would have been extremely unhappy.
<PER>Harry</PER> sometimes felt that <PER>Harry</PER> was living for the hours <PER>Harry</PER> spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but thoroughly enjoying <PER>Harry</PER> at the same time, swelling with pride as <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>'s fellow D.A.
Indeed, <PER>Harry</PER> sometimes wondered how <PER>Umbridge</PER> was going to react when all the members of the D.A.
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said <PER>Cho</PER> brightly, watching <PER>Cho</PER>'s silvery swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last lesson before Easter.
<PER>Neville</PER> face was screwed up in concentration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from <PER>Neville</PER>'s wand tip.
“You’ve got to think of something happy,” <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m trying,” said <PER>Neville</PER> miserably, who was trying so hard <PER>Neville</PER>'s round face was actually shining with sweat.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been brought along to <PER>Harry</PER>'s first ever D.A.
“Look — ah — it’s gone But it was definitely something hairy, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER>’s Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gamboling around her.
Next thing <PER>Harry</PER> knew, something was tugging at <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes somewhere near the knee.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s very great astonishment, Dobby the house-elf peering up at <PER>Harry</PER> from beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual eight hats.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir ” squeaked the elf, trembling from head to foot, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir Dobby has come to warn you but the house-elves have been warned not to tell ” sir Dobby ran headfirst at the wall: <PER>Harry</PER>, who had some experience of Dobby’s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by him's eight hats.
“What’s happened, Dobby?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, grabbing the elf’s tiny arm and holding <PER>Harry</PER> away from anything with which <PER>Harry</PER> might seek to hurt <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter she she ” Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with himself's free fist: <PER>Harry</PER> seized that too.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, horrified.
Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees; <PER>Harry</PER> held him at bay.
His hands held fast by <PER>Harry</PER>, the elf tried to kick <PER>Harry</PER> and fell to the floor.
“Yes, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, yes!” <PER>Harry</PER> straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf.
It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer — “<PER>Harry</PER>, come on!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER> from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out.
“Thank you, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> started to run right; there was a boys’ bathroom up ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> could pretend He’d been in there all the time if <PER>Harry</PER> could just reach it — Something caught him around the ankles and him fell spectacularly, skidding along on him's front for six feet before coming to a halt.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of <PER>Ron</PER> — Molly would kill him — and of how <PER>Hermione</PER> would feel if <PER>Hermione</PER> was expelled before <PER>Hermione</PER> could take <PER>Hermione</PER>'s O.W.L.s.
And it had been Seamus’s very first meeting and <PER>Neville</PER> had been getting so good “Fizzing Whizbee,” sang <PER>Umbridge</PER>, and the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split open, and they ascended the moving stone staircase.
they reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but <PER>Umbridge</PER> did not bother to knock, <PER>Umbridge</PER> strode straight inside, still holding tight to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sitting behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s expression serene, the tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long fingers together.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stood rigidly beside Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s face extremely tense.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> free of <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s grasp as the door swung shut behind them.
<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge was glaring at <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge with a kind of vicious satisfaction upon <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge's face.
“Well, well, well ” <PER>Harry</PER> replied with the dirtiest look <PER>Harry</PER> could muster.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart drummed madly inside <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain was oddly cool and clear.
“The <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy cornered him.” “Did The <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy, did The <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy?” said Fudge appreciatively.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was not looking directly at <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes were fixed upon a point just over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s shoulder, but as <PER>Harry</PER> stared at him, him shook him's head a fraction of an inch to each side.
Fudge looked incredulously from <PER>Harry</PER> to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> took advantage of <PER>Harry</PER>'s momentary inattention to steal another quick look at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink.
“So it’s news to you, is it,” said Fudge, his voice now thick with anger, “that an illegal student organization has been discovered within this school?” “Yes, it is,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“I think, Minister,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> silkily from beside <PER>Harry</PER>, “we might make better progress if I fetch we informant.” “Yes, yes, do,” said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Umbridge</PER> left the room.
“There’s nothing like a good witness, is there, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “Nothing at all, <PER>Cornelius</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gravely, inclining his head.
There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then <PER>Harry</PER> heard the door open behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> moved past <PER>Harry</PER> into the room, gripping by the shoulder <PER>Cho</PER>’s curly-haired friend Marietta, who was hiding <PER>Cho</PER>'s face in <PER>Cho</PER>'s hands.
“So she can speak freely?” “I have not yet managed to find one,” <PER>Umbridge</PER> admitted grudgingly, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt a surge of pride in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s jinxing ability.
“The purpose of Potter’s meeting with these students,” continued Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, “was to persuade these students to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses The Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age — ” “I think you 11 find you’re wrong there, Dolores,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly, peering at Dolores's over the half- moon spectacles perched halfway down <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s crooked nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was going to talk <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word <PER>Harry</PER> said in the Hog’s Head there was simply no escaping it.
“Oh, very good, Minister, very good!” <PER>Harry</PER> could have kicked <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s astonishment, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was smiling gently too.
“<PER>Cornelius</PER>, I do not deny — and nor, I am sure, does <PER>Harry</PER> — that <PER>Harry</PER> was in the Hog’s Head that day, nor that <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group.
This was it, these meetings had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would be able to shift aside “Just nod or shake your head, dear,” <PER>Umbridge</PER> said coaxingly to Marietta.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’sArmy.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> gazed at the heading scribbled by <PER>Hermione</PER> months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak.
“Would you like a written confession from me, <PER>Cornelius</PER> — or will a statement before these witnesses suffice?” <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Kingsley look at each other.
“What — I don’t — ?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army, <PER>Cornelius</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge’s face.
Kingsley flashed a look of warning at Kingsley, <PER>McGonagall</PER> widened her eyes threateningly, but it had suddenly dawned upon <PER>Harry</PER> what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was about to do, and Kingsley could not let it happen.
“No — Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “Be quiet, <PER>Harry</PER>, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,” said — Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
“I see no snag, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “Well,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> apologetically, “I’m afraid I do.” “Oh really?” “Well — it’s just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to — what is the phrase?
Fudge stared at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with a very silly expression on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face, as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand drift, almost casually, toward <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket.
“So,” sneered Fudge, recovering himself, “you intend to take on Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, and myself single-handed, do you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “Merlin’s beard, no,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling.
A hand grabbed the scruff of <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck and forced <PER>Harry</PER> down on the floor as a second silver flash went off — several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes screeched, and a cloud of dust filled the air.
Coughing in the dust, <PER>Harry</PER> saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> struggled around to see who was half- strangling <PER>Harry</PER> and saw Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> crouched beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, getting up and dragging <PER>Harry</PER> and Marietta with her.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s wrist.
“Remember — close your mind — ” But as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s fingers closed over <PER>Harry</PER>’s skin, a pain shot through the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt again that terrible, snakelike longing to strike <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to bite him, to hurt <PER>Harry</PER> — “ — you will understand,” whispered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> released <PER>Harry</PER>, raised his hand, and grasped the phoenix’s long golden tail.
“Well, Minerva,” said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirtsleeve, “I’m afraid this is the end of your friend <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “You think so, do you?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> scornfully.
“You’d better get those two off to bed,” said Fudge, looking back at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> with a dismissive nod toward <PER>Harry</PER> and Marietta.
“You know, Minister, I disagree with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on many counts but you cannot deny <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s got style” Dolores Jane <PER>Umbridge</PER> (High Inquisitor) has replaced Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Signed: <PER>Cornelius</PER> Oswald Fudge The notices had gone up all over the school overnight, but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the Minister of Magic, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s Junior Assistant to escape.
No matter where <PER>Harry</PER> went within the castle next day, the sole topic of conversation was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s flight, and though some of the details might have gone awry in the retelling (<PER>Harry</PER> overheard one second-year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St. Mungo’s with a pumpkin for a head), it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was.
Everybody seemed aware, for instance, that <PER>Harry</PER> and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office, and as Marietta was now in the hospital wing, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> besieged with requests to give a firsthand account wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> will be back before long,” said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology after listening intently to <PER>Harry</PER>’s story.
“Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid puffed-up, power-crazy old — ” “Now, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had slid out from behind the door, followed by Crabbe and Goyle.
“He can’t be allowed to dock points that would be ridiculous It would completely undermine the prefect system” But <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had turned automatically toward the giant hourglasses set in niches along the wall behind them, which recorded the House points.
He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Ernie in front of the hourglasses.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> just docked us all about fifty points,” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously, as they watched several more stones fly upward from the Gryffindor hourglass.
“Just in case ” “Yeah, all right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and the three of them moved toward the doors to the Great Hall, but <PER>Harry</PER> had barely glimpsed today’s ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder and, turning, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> almost nose to nose with Filch, the caretaker.
“Follow me” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced back at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were both looking worried.
“Here we are,” he said, leering down at <PER>Harry</PER> as he rapped three times upon Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s door and pushed it open.
“The Potter boy to see you, ma’am.” <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office, so very familiar to <PER>Harry</PER> from <PER>Harry</PER>'s many detentions, was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word HEADMISTRESS; also his Firebolt, and Fred’s and George’s Clean-sweeps, which he saw with a pang were now chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> was sitting behind the desk, busily scribbling upon some of <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s pink parchment, but looked up and smiled widely at their entrance.
“Sit,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> curtly, pointing toward a chair, and <PER>Harry</PER> sat.
“What would you like to drink?” “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, quite sure <PER>Harry</PER> had misheard her.
“<PER>Cho</PER>ose one.” “Fine tea then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shrugging.
One of the horrible painted kittens behind <PER>Umbridge</PER> had great round blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moody’s magical one, and it had just occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> what Mad-Eye would say if <PER>Harry</PER> ever heard that <PER>Harry</PER> had drunk anything offered by a known enemy.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised the cup to <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips again and pretended to take a sip, though keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth tightly closed.
“Where is Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “No idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER> promptly.
“In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach turned over and <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand holding the teacup shook so that the cup rattled in its saucer.
<PER>Harry</PER> tilted the cup to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth with <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid trickled down onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Haven’t got a clue.” They stared at each other so long that <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes watering.
“What was — ?” She was gazing toward the door; <PER>Harry</PER> took the opportunity to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s almost full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers.
“Back to lunch with you, Potter!” cried <PER>Umbridge</PER>, raising <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s wand and dashing out of the office.
Firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere <PER>Harry</PER> looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight, or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer <PER>Harry</PER> watched.
As <PER>Harry</PER> watched, one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to maneuver; it whirled toward <PER>Umbridge</PER> and Filch with a sinister voheeeeeeeeee.
Laughing, <PER>Harry</PER> ducked down low, ran to a door <PER>Harry</PER> knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just behind it, listening to <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s and Filch’s yells and quaking with suppressed mirth.
“Miss Brown, would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing the headmistress's that we have an escaped firework in our classroom?” The upshot of it all was that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> spent Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid none of whom's rooms of the fireworks without her.
When the final bell rang and the students were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with the students's bags, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, with immense satisfaction, a disheveled and soot- blackened <PER>Umbridge</PER> tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick’s classroom.
Even <PER>Hermione</PER> fought Even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s way through the excited crowd around them to congratulate them.
“If you want to add your name to the waiting list, <PER>Hermione</PER>, it’s five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty for the Deflagration Deluxe” <PER>Hermione</PER> returned to the table where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework might spring out of it and start doing itself.
“Now you mention it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> happily, “d’you know I think I’m feeling a bit rebellious.” <PER>Harry</PER> could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went up to bed an hour later, and as <PER>Harry</PER> got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word POO.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> got into bed, yawning.
With <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>'s glasses off, the occasional fire-work still passing the window became blurred, looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky.
He turned onto He's side, wondering how <PER>Umbridge</PER> was feeling about <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s first day in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s job, and how Fudge would react when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption Smiling to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> closed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant or perhaps he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was simply speeding away from them he had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries.
“I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and it’s like they mated, come and see!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay quite still and silent while the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar subsided and disappointment washed over <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from <PER>Harry</PER> at the very last moment <PER>Harry</PER> had got so close that time Glittering, pink-and-silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower.
<PER>Harry</PER> stomach gave a sickening jolt as <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> had Occlumency the following evening <PER>Harry</PER> spent the whole of the next day dreading what <PER>Snape</PER> was going to say if <PER>Harry</PER> found out how much farther into the Department of Mysteries His had penetrated during <PER>Harry</PER>'s last dream.
With a surge of guilt <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER> had not practiced Occlumency once since their last lesson: There had been too much going on since <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> would not have been able to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind even if <PER>Harry</PER> had tried.
<PER>Harry</PER> doubted, however, whether <PER>Snape</PER> would accept that excuse <PER>Harry</PER> attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good, <PER>Hermione</PER> kept asking <PER>Harry</PER> what was wrong whenever <PER>Harry</PER> fell silent trying to rid <PER>Harry</PER> of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain was not while teachers were firing review questions at the class.
Halfway across the entrance hall, however, <PER>Cho</PER> came hurrying up to <PER>Cho</PER>.
“Over here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with <PER>Snape</PER> and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall where the giant hourglasses stood.
“No, it was only Well, I just wanted to say <PER>Harry</PER>, I never dreamed Marietta would tell” “Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER> moodily.
<PER>Harry</PER> did feel <PER>Cho</PER> might have chosen <PER>Cho</PER>'s friends a bit more carefully.
“You know, her mum works for the Ministry, it’s really difficult for her — ” “<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad works for the Ministry too!” <PER>Harry</PER> said furiously.
“And in case you hadn’t noticed, <PER>Harry</PER> hasn’t got ‘sneak’ written across <PER>Harry</PER>'s face — ” “That was a really horrible trick of <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger’s,” said <PER>Cho</PER> fiercely.
“<PER>Cho</PER> should have told us she’d jinxed that list — ” “I think it was a brilliant idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER> coldly.
<PER>Cho</PER> flushed and <PER>Cho</PER>'s eyes grew brighter.
“Oh yes, I forgot — of course, if it was darling <PER>Hermione</PER>’s idea — ” “Don’t start crying again,” said <PER>Harry</PER> warningly.
Fuming, <PER>Harry</PER> descended the stairs to <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, and though <PER>Harry</PER> knew from experience how much easier it would be for <PER>Snape</PER> to penetrate <PER>Snape</PER>'s mind if <PER>Snape</PER> arrived angry and resentful, <PER>Snape</PER> succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more good things <PER>Snape</PER> should have said to <PER>Cho</PER> about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door.
“You’re late, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, as <PER>Harry</PER> closed the door behind him.
<PER>Snape</PER> was standing with <PER>Snape</PER>'s back to <PER>Harry</PER>, removing, as usual, certain of <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts and placing them carefully in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve.
“Have you been practicing?” “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk.
“Wand out, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> moved into <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual position, facing <PER>Snape</PER> with the desk between them.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart was pumping fast with anger at <PER>Cho</PER> and anxiety about how much <PER>Snape</PER> was about to extract from <PER>Snape</PER>'s mind.
“One — two — ” <PER>Snape</PER>’s office door banged open and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> sped in.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, sir — oh — sorry — ” <PER>Malfoy</PER> was looking at <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> in some surprise.
“It’s all right, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, lowering his wand.
“Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions.” <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen <PER>Malfoy</PER> look so gleeful since <PER>Umbridge</PER> had turned up to inspect <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“I didn’t know,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, leering at <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew his face was burning.
“Well, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, what is it?” asked <PER>Snape</PER>.
“It’s Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, sir — she needs your help,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> mouthed “Remedial Potions?” at <PER>Harry</PER> behind <PER>Snape</PER> ’s back before following <PER>Harry</PER> behind <PER>Snape</PER> ’s.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s thoughts things he did not want <PER>Harry</PER> to see if he broke through <PER>Snape</PER>’s defenses accidentally <PER>Harry</PER> gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside <PER>Harry</PER> What was it that <PER>Snape</PER> was so keen to hide from <PER>Harry</PER>?
Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that <PER>Snape</PER> was determined to keep from <PER>Snape</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart now pumping harder and faster than ever.
Would <PER>Snape</PER> come straight back to <PER>Snape</PER>'s office afterward, or accompany Montague to the hospital wing?
Surely Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, <PER>Snape</PER> would want to make sure <PER>Snape</PER> was all right <PER>Harry</PER> walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over the Pensieve, gazing into the Pensieve depths.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, listening, then pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand again.
<PER>Harry</PER> was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling In fact, unless <PER>Harry</PER> was much mistaken, <PER>Harry</PER> was looking down upon the Great Hall He breath was actually fogging the surface of <PER>Snape</PER>’s thoughts <PER>Snape</PER> brain seemed to be in limbo It would be insane to do the thing that <PER>Harry</PER> was so strongly tempted to do <PER>Harry</PER> was trembling <PER>Snape</PER> could be back at any moment but <PER>Harry</PER> thought of <PER>Cho</PER>’s anger, of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> took a great gulp of breath and plunged <PER>Harry</PER>'s face into the surface of <PER>Snape</PER>’s thoughts.
At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping <PER>Harry</PER> headfirst into <PER>Harry</PER> was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as <PER>Harry</PER> went, and then — <PER>Harry</PER> was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four House tables were gone.
<PER>Snape</PER> had to be here somewhere This was <PER>Snape</PER>'s memory And there <PER>Snape</PER> was, at a table right behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER>-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about <PER>Snape</PER>-the-teenager, like a plant kept in the dark.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved around behind <PER>Snape</PER> and read the heading of the examination paper: So <PER>Snape</PER> had to be fifteen or sixteen, around <PER>Harry</PER>’s own age.
<PER>Harry</PER> hand was flying across the parchment; <PER>Harry</PER> had written at least a foot more than <PER>Harry</PER>'s closest neighbors, and yet <PER>Harry</PER>'s writing was minuscule and cramped.
“Five more minutes!” The voice made <PER>Harry</PER> jump; turning, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the top of Professor Flitwick’s head moving between the desks a short distance away.
Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair very untidy black hair <PER>Harry</PER> moved so quickly that, had <PER>Harry</PER> been solid, <PER>Harry</PER> would have knocked desks flying.
The back of the black-haired boy’s head drew nearer and nearer the black-haired boy’s was straightening up now, putting down the black-haired boy’s's quill, pulling the black-haired boy’s's roll of parchment toward the black-haired boy’s so as to reread what the black-haired boy’s had written <PER>Harry</PER> stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s fifteen-year- old father.
James’s hair stuck up at the back exactly as <PER>Harry</PER>’s did, his hands could have been <PER>Harry</PER>’s, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other’s heights.
Sirius was lounging in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair at <PER>Harry</PER>'s ease, tilting it back on two legs.
He was very good-looking; He's dark hair fell into He's eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James’s nor <PER>Harry</PER>’s could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind <PER>Harry</PER> was eyeing <PER>Harry</PER> hopefully, though <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t seem to have noticed.
and was absorbed in the exam: As <PER>Harry</PER> reread <PER>Harry</PER>'s answers <PER>Harry</PER> scratched <PER>Harry</PER>'s chin with the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill, frowning slightly.
“Very well, everybody, you’re free to go!” <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s father, who had hastily crossed out the L. E. <PER>Harry</PER> had been embellishing, jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, stuffed <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill and the exam question paper into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, which <PER>Harry</PER> slung over <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join his.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and glimpsed <PER>Snape</PER> a short way away, moving between the tables toward the doors into the entrance hall, still absorbed in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own examination paper.
Round-shouldered yet angular, <PER>Harry</PER> walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, <PER>Harry</PER>'s oily hair swinging about <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
A gang of chattering girls separated <PER>Snape</PER> from James and Sirius, and by planting <PER>Harry</PER> in the midst of this group, <PER>Harry</PER> managed to keep <PER>Snape</PER> in sight while straining <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears to catch the voices of James and his friends.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked anxiously behind <PER>Harry</PER> again.
<PER>Snape</PER> remained close by, still buried in <PER>Harry</PER>'s examination questions; but this was <PER>Snape</PER>’s memory, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that if <PER>Snape</PER> chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, he, <PER>Harry</PER>, would not be able to follow James any farther.
To James's intense relief, however, when James and James's three friends strode off down the lawn toward the lake, <PER>Snape</PER> followed, still poring over the paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where <PER>Snape</PER> was going.
They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had spent a Sunday finishing <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s homework, and threw They down on the grass.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder yet again and saw, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s delight, that <PER>Snape</PER> had settled <PER>Harry</PER> on the grass in the dense shadows of a clump of bushes.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had a habit of rumpling up <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair as though to make sure it did not get too tidy, and also that <PER>Harry</PER> kept looking over at the girls by the water’s edge.
<PER>Snape</PER> was on <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet again, and was stowing the O.W.L.
Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to <PER>Snape</PER> with a look of avid anticipation on <PER>Snape</PER>'s face.
<PER>Snape</PER> reacted so fast it was as though <PER>Snape</PER> had been expecting an attack: Dropping <PER>Snape</PER>'s bag, <PER>Snape</PER> plunged <PER>Snape</PER>'s hand inside <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes, and <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, “ ExpelliarmusV’ <PER>Snape</PER> ’s wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him.
<PER>Snape</PER> was trying to get up, but the jinx was still operating on <PER>Snape</PER>; <PER>Snape</PER> was struggling, as though bound by invisible ropes.
“What’re you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?” <PER>Snape</PER> let out a stream of mixed swearwords and hexes, but <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand being ten feet away nothing happened.
<PER>Snape</PER> was beginning to inch toward <PER>Snape</PER>'s fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as <PER>Snape</PER> crawled.
“OY!” But too late; <PER>Snape</PER> had directed <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James’s face, spattering his robes with blood.
Disentangling <PER>Snape</PER> from <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes, <PER>Snape</PER> got quickly to <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet, wand up, but Sirius said, “Petrificus Totalusl” and <PER>Snape</PER> keeled over again at once, rigid as a board.
“There you go,” James said, as <PER>Snape</PER> struggled to <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet again, “you’re lucky Evans was here, Snivellus — ” “I don’t need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!” Lily blinked.
Wincing, <PER>Harry</PER> looked around to see who had hold of <PER>Harry</PER>, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized <PER>Snape</PER> standing right beside him, white with rage.
“Having fun?” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> rising into the air.
The summer’s day evaporated around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was floating upward through icy blackness, <PER>Snape</PER>’s hand still tight upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s upper arm.
Then, with a swooping feeling as though <PER>Harry</PER> had turned head over heels in midair, <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet hit the stone floor of <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, and <PER>Harry</PER> was standing again beside the Pensieve on <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master’s study.
“So,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so tightly <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand was starting to feel numb.
“So been enjoying yourself, Potter?” “N-no ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to free <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
It was scary: <PER>Snape</PER>’s lips were shaking, <PER>Snape</PER>'s face was white, <PER>Snape</PER>'s teeth were bared.
“Amusing man, your father, wasn’t he?” said <PER>Snape</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER> so hard that <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses slipped down <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose.
“I — didn’t — ” <PER>Snape</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> from <PER>Snape</PER> with all his might.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet as far from <PER>Snape</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
“No, of course I w — ” “Get out, get out, I don’t want to see you in this office ever again!” And as <PER>Harry</PER> hurtled toward the door, ajar of dead cockroaches exploded over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> what He had just seen.
What was making <PER>Harry</PER> feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at <PER>Harry</PER> — it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how <PER>Snape</PER> had felt as <PER>Snape</PER>'s father had taunted him, and that judging from what him had just seen, him's father had been every bit as arrogant as <PER>Snape</PER> had always told <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> reckons I can carry on by myself now I’ve got the basics” “So you’ve stopped having funny dreams?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> skeptically.
“Well, I don’t think <PER>Snape</PER> should stop until you’re absolutely sure you can control them!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> indignantly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think you should go back to <PER>Harry</PER> and ask — ” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> forcefully.
“Just drop it, <PER>Hermione</PER>, okay?” It was the first day of the Easter holidays and <PER>Hermione</PER>, as was her custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedules for the three of them.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had let her do it — it was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.
“How can that come as a shock?” <PER>Hermione</PER> demanded, as <PER>Hermione</PER> tapped each little square on <PER>Ron</PER>’s schedule with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand so that it flashed a different color according to it subject.
“I dunno ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “there’s been a lot going on” “Well, there you are,” she said, handing him him's schedule, “if you follow that you should do fine.” <PER>Ron</PER> looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.
“I saw <PER>Cho</PER> earlier,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively, “and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked really miserable too Have you two had a row again?” “Wha — oh yeah, we have,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, seizing gratefully on the excuse.
“If it hadn’t been for her ” <PER>Ron</PER> went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which <PER>Harry</PER> found helpful.
Hadn’t people like <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Sirius told <PER>Harry</PER> how wonderful <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had been?
( Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head <PER>Harry</PER> was as bad, wasn’t <PER>Harry</PER>?)
Yes, he had once overheard Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside down for the fun of it not unless them really loathed them Perhaps <PER>Malfoy</PER>, or somebody who really deserved it <PER>Harry</PER> tried to make a case for <PER>Snape</PER> having deserved what <PER>Harry</PER> had suffered at James’s hands — but hadn’t Lily asked, “What’s he done to you?” And hadn’t James replied, “It’s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean?” Hadn’t James started it all simply because Sirius said James was bored?
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had made <PER>Harry</PER> prefect in the hope that <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius But in the Pensieve, <PER>Harry</PER> had sat there and let it all happen <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER> that Lily had intervened; <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother had been decent, yet the memory of the look on Lily's face as Lily had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else.
She had clearly loathed James and <PER>Harry</PER> simply could not understand how James and <PER>Harry</PER> could have ended up married.
<PER>Harry</PER> pretended that <PER>Harry</PER>'s bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, fellow Gryffindors's excuse went unchallenged.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m talking to <PER>Harry</PER>, can you hear me?” “Huh?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around.
<PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined <PER>Harry</PER> at the library table where <PER>Harry</PER> had been sitting alone.
It was late on Sunday evening; <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to review Ancient Runes; <PER>Ron</PER> had Quidditch practice.
“Oh hi,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER>'s books back toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Anyway a package just arrived, a package’s only just got through <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s new screening process” She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped, and there was a scribbled note across it in red ink, reading INSPECTED AND PASSED BY THE “It’s Easter eggs from Mum,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at it for a moment, then, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s horror, felt a hard lump rise in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“Are you okay, <PER>Harry</PER>?” asked <PER>Ginny</PER> quietly.
“You know, I’m sure if you just talked to <PER>Cho</PER> ” “It’s not <PER>Cho</PER> I want to talk to,” said <PER>Harry</PER> brusquely.
“But I know I can’t.” More to give He something to do than because He really wanted any, <PER>Harry</PER> unwrapped <PER>Harry</PER>'s Easter egg, broke off a large bit, and put his Easter egg into his mouth.
“Well,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> slowly, helping <PER>Ginny</PER> to a bit of egg too, “if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it” “Come on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hopelessly.
“With <PER>Umbridge</PER> policing the fires and reading all our mail?” “The thing about growing up with Fred and George,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> thoughtfully, “is that you sort of start thinking anything’s possible if you’ve got enough nerve.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate — Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementors — or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside he for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful “Oh damn,” whispered <PER>Ginny</PER>, jumping to <PER>Ginny</PER>'s feet.
“Out — out And whipping out her wand, her caused <PER>Harry</PER>’s books, bag, and ink bottle to chase him and <PER>Ginny</PER> from the library, whacking him and <PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Ginny</PER> repeatedly over the head as they ran.
“She says you need to talk to Sirius?” “What?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply, freezing with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand halfway toward picking up MAKE A BANG AT “Yeah ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to sound casual, “yeah, I thought I’d like — ” “Don’t be so ridiculous,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, straightening up and looking at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Hermione</PER> could not believe <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes.
“And if we’re going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that <PER>Harry</PER> can have <PER>Harry</PER>'s chat with Sirius?” “Yes, but still,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, “even if you do cause a diversion, how is <PER>Harry</PER> supposed to talk to him?” “<PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could think of no alternative; <PER>Umbridge</PER> herself had told <PER>Harry</PER> that the only fire that was not being watched was <PER>Umbridge</PER> herself's own.
“So even if she’s bewitched the door so Alohomora won’t work, which I bet she has — ” “What do you think about this?” <PER>Hermione</PER> demanded of <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was reminded irresistibly of Mistress Weasley appealing to her husband during <PER>Harry</PER>’s first dinner in Grimmauld Place.
“If <PER>Harry</PER> wants to do it, it’s up to <PER>Harry</PER>, isn’t it?” “Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,” said Fred, clapping <PER>Ron</PER> hard on the back.
“At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy’s corridor round about five o’clock tomorrow.” <PER>Harry</PER> awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as <PER>Harry</PER> had done on the morning of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hearing at the Ministry of Magic.
It was not only the prospect of breaking into <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making <PER>Harry</PER> feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough — today also happened to be the first time <PER>Harry</PER> would be in close proximity with <PER>Snape</PER> since <PER>Snape</PER> had thrown him out of him's office, as they had Potions that day.
After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside <PER>Neville</PER>’s bed, staring out on a truly glorious morning.
Directly ahead of him, <PER>Harry</PER> could see the towering beech tree below which <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had once tormented <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to <PER>Harry</PER> that would make up for what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the Pensieve, but <PER>Harry</PER> was desperate to hear Sirius’s own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for He's father’s behavior Something caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
<PER>Harry</PER> squinted into the sun and saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> emerging from between the trees.
As <PER>Harry</PER> watched, <PER>Hagrid</PER> staggered to the door of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin and disappeared inside ] cabin.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so <PER>Hagrid</PER> could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire <PER>Harry</PER> turned away from the window, headed back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk, and started to dress.
With the prospect of forcing entry into <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> had never expected the day to be a restful one, but <PER>Harry</PER> had not reckoned on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s almost continual attempts to dissuade <PER>Harry</PER> from what <PER>Harry</PER> was planning to do at five o’clock.
For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that <PER>Harry</PER> tried very hard to ignore. "
and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, shell be able to guess you’ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she’ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer shis questions” “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a low and indignant voice, “are you going to stop telling <PER>Harry</PER> off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take notes instead?” “You take notes for a change, it won’t kill you!” By the time they reached the dungeons, neither <PER>Harry</PER> nor <PER>Ron</PER> was speaking to <PER>Hermione</PER> any longer.
Undeterred, <PER>Hermione</PER> took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all uttered under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking Seamus's cauldron for leaks.
<PER>Snape</PER>, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though <PER>Harry</PER> were invisible.
<PER>Harry</PER> was, of course, well used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernon’s favorites, and on the whole was grateful <PER>Harry</PER> had to suffer nothing worse.
In fact, compared to what <PER>Harry</PER> usually had to endure from <PER>Snape</PER> in the way of taunts and snide remarks, <PER>Harry</PER> found the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to find that when left well alone, <PER>Harry</PER> was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily.
At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked some of the potion, and took some of the potion up to <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an he had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise; <PER>Malfoy</PER> gave a gleeful yell of laughter.
<PER>Harry</PER> potion sample lay in pieces on the floor, and <PER>Snape</PER> was watching <PER>Snape</PER> with a look of gloating pleasure.
“I’m really sorry, Potter <PER>Harry</PER>, I thought you’d finished, so I cleared up!” Potter <PER>Harry</PER> could not bring Potter <PER>Harry</PER> to answer.
When the bell rang Potter <PER>Harry</PER> hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure that Potter <PER>Harry</PER> found Potter <PER>Harry</PER> a seat between <PER>Neville</PER> and Seamus for lunch so that <PER>Hermione</PER> could not start nagging him about using <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office again.
him was in such a bad mood by the time that him got to Divination that him had quite forgotten him's career appointment with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, remembering only when <PER>Ron</PER> asked him why him wasn’t in her office.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was sitting there, a clipboard on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s knee, a fussy little pie-frill around Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s neck, and a small, horribly smug smile on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down with <PER>Harry</PER>'s back to <PER>Umbridge</PER> and did <PER>Harry</PER>'s best to pretend <PER>Harry</PER> could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.
<PER>Harry</PER> was finding the scratching noise from behind <PER>Harry</PER> very distracting.
“Yes?” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> prompted <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> ignored Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> closed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.
“May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> asked curtly, without looking at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“Oh no, thank you very much,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, with that simpering laugh <PER>Harry</PER> hated so much.
“Well, then, I am confused I’m afraid I don’t quite understand how you can give Potter false hope that — ” “False hope?” repeated Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, still refusing to look round at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“He has achieved high marks in all He's Defense Against the Dark Arts tests — ” “I’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, <PER>Harry</PER> has been achieving very poor results in <PER>Harry</PER>'s classes with me — ” “I should have made my meaning plainer,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning at last to look <PER>Umbridge</PER> directly in the eyes.
“<PER>Harry</PER> has achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb blowing.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> turned back to <PER>Harry</PER>, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s thin nostrils flared, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyes burning.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s fussy, simpering demeanor had given place to a hard fury that made Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s broad, flabby face look oddly sinister.
“Aha!” shrieked Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, pointing a stubby finger at <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Potter, that concludes our career consultation.” <PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was still breathing as though Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had just run a race when Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.
“I hope you’ve thought better of what you were planning to do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, the moment they had opened their books to chapter thirty- four (“Non-Retaliation and Negotiation”).
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> looks like she’s in a really bad mood already” Every now and then <PER>Umbridge</PER> shot glowering looks at <PER>Harry</PER>, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking his could just imagine Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s reaction if his were caught trespassing in Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office mere hours after she had vouched for him There was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that sometime during the next summer holiday him would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene him had witnessed in the Pensieve Nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into him's stomach And then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father’s old Invisibility Cloak But the fact remained that if he were caught “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sacrificed himself to keep you in school, <PER>Harry</PER>!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, raising her book to hide her face from <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, don’t do it, please don’t do it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not answer; <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what to do.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed determined to give neither <PER>Harry</PER>'s opinion nor <PER>Harry</PER>'s advice.
He would not look at <PER>Harry</PER>, though when <PER>Hermione</PER> opened <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth to try dissuading <PER>Harry</PER> some more, <PER>Harry</PER> said in a low voice, “Give it a rest, okay?
<PER>Harry</PER> was halfway along the corridor outside when <PER>Harry</PER> heard the unmistakable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance.
People exiting the classrooms all around <PER>Harry</PER> were stopping in People exiting the classrooms all around <PER>Harry</PER>'s tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully Then <PER>Umbridge</PER> came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — please!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> weakly.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what <PER>Harry</PER> was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder.
<PER>Harry</PER> crouched down in front of the empty grate, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands shaking.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never done this before, though <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew how it must work.
Sticking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head into the fireplace, Sticking <PER>Harry</PER> took a large pinch of powder and dropped a large pinch of powder onto the logs stacked neatly beneath Sticking <PER>Harry</PER>.
Feeling rather sick and as though he was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes to find that <PER>Harry</PER> was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire — <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s hard stone floor.
“Look, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Sirius placatingly, “James and <PER>Snape</PER> hated each other from the moment James and <PER>Snape</PER> set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can’t you?
“Did I ever tell you to lay off <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Snape</PER> said.
“Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?” “Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of us sometimes That was something” “And,” said <PER>Harry</PER> doggedly, determined to say everything that was on <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind now <PER>Harry</PER> was here, “<PER>Harry</PER> kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching <PER>Harry</PER>!” “Oh, well, <PER>Harry</PER> always made a fool of <PER>Harry</PER> whenever Lily was around,” said Sirius, shrugging.
“<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stop <PER>Harry</PER> showing off whenever <PER>Harry</PER> got near Lily.” “How come Lily married him?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked miserably.
“Even <PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I mean, James didn’t take “<PER>Snape</PER> on dates with James's and jinx him in front of James, did him?” Sirius frowned at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was still looking unconvinced.
“I just never thought I’d feel sorry for <PER>Snape</PER>.” “Now you mention it,” said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, “how did <PER>Snape</PER> react when <PER>Snape</PER> found you’d seen all this?” <PER>Snape</PER> told me <PER>Snape</PER>’d never teach me Occlumency again,” said <PER>Harry</PER> indifferently, “like that’s a big disappoint “He WHAT?” shouted Sirius, causing <PER>Harry</PER> to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s stopped giving you lessons?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, surprised at what <PER>Harry</PER> considered a great overreaction.
“But it’s okay, I don’t care, it’s a bit of a relief to tell you the — ” “I’m coming up there to have a word with <PER>Snape</PER>!” said Sirius forcefully and <PER>Snape</PER> actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched <PER>Snape</PER> back down again.
“If anyone’s going to tell <PER>Snape</PER> it will be me!” anyone’s going to tell <PER>Snape</PER> it will be me!
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, first of all, you’re to go back to <PER>Snape</PER> and tell <PER>Snape</PER> that on no account is <PER>Snape</PER> to stop giving you lessons — when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hears — ” “I can’t tell <PER>Snape</PER> that, <PER>Snape</PER>’d kill me!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, outraged.
“You didn’t see <PER>Harry</PER> when we got out of the Pensieve — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!” said Lupin sternly.
“Ah, she’s left it open” <PER>Harry</PER> dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over <PER>Harry</PER> when Filch burst into the office.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and, making sure that <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen <PER>Harry</PER> go.
One landing down from <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office and <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was safe to become visible again; <PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the cloak, shoved it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and hurried onward.
“So!” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> triumphantly, whom <PER>Harry</PER> realized was standing just a few stairs in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, once more looking down upon her prey.
And before <PER>Umbridge</PER> could say a word, they raised their wands and said together, “Accio BroomsV’ <PER>Harry</PER> heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance.
“Give her hell from us, Peeves.” And Peeves, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen take an order from a student before, swept <PER>Harry</PER>'s belled hat from <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.
<PER>Harry</PER> was certain that teachers like <PER>McGonagall</PER> or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George’s Wildfire Whiz- Bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch <PER>Umbridge</PER> struggle.
Filch fitted a new door and removed <PER>Harry</PER>’s Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumored, <PER>Umbridge</PER> had set an armed security troll to guard it.
In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy- snouted niffler into <PER>Umbridge</PER> ’s office, which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on <PER>Umbridge</PER> on her re-entrance, and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> only had to enter <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers, or else spout blood from both nostrils.
Indeed, a week after Fred and George’s departure <PER>Harry</PER> witnessed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn <PER>Harry</PER> heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, “It unscrews the other way.” To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from Montague's sojourn in the toilet.
“Should we say something?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a worried voice, pressing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cheek against the Charms window so that <PER>Hermione</PER> could see Mister and Mistress Montague marching inside.
“Anyway, more trouble for <PER>Umbridge</PER>, isn’t it?” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a satisfied voice.
“Reparo\” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, mending <PER>Ron</PER>’s cup with a wave of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand.
“Why should I be worried about you?” “When Mum’s next letter finally gets through <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s screening process,” said <PER>Ron</PER> bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, “I’m going to be in deep trouble.
“How do you know?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“ ’Specially if she thinks they’re receiving stolen cauldrons or something” <PER>Hermione</PER> said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but <PER>Harry</PER> had a shrewd suspicion that shis self- restraint was bound to crack before long.
<PER>Ron</PER> snorted disbelievingly and <PER>Hermione</PER> threw him a very dirty look.
“As a matter of fact, I was going to ask <PER>Harry</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER>’s going to go back to <PER>Snape</PER> and ask for Occlumency lessons again!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart sank.
Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George’s dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had wanted to hear news of Sirius.
As <PER>Harry</PER> had not confided in them the reason <PER>Harry</PER> had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of things to tell them.
He had been regretting this ever since; <PER>Hermione</PER> would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when <PER>Harry</PER> least expected it.
“You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said now, “because <PER>Ron</PER> told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again” <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Ron</PER> a furious look.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a kind of vindictive pleasure: <PER>Harry</PER> had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort.
<PER>Harry</PER> had passed through the circular room, then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres <PER>Harry</PER> had hurried straight toward row number ninety- seven, turned left, and ran along it It had probably been then that <PER>Harry</PER> had spoken aloud Just a bit farther for <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s conscious self struggling to wake and before <PER>Harry</PER> had reached the end of the row, <PER>Harry</PER> had found <PER>Harry</PER> lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster.
“You are trying to block your mind, aren’t you?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking beadily at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose ears were still flaming red, “if Montague doesn’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup.” “Yeah, I s’pose so,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glad of a change of subject.
“I mean, we’ve won one, lost one — if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday — ” “Yeah, that’s right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, losing track of what <PER>Harry</PER> was agreeing to: <PER>Cho</PER> Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I mean, I can’t get any worse, can I?” he told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match.
“Nothing to lose now, is there?” “You know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, “I think <PER>Ron</PER> might do better without Fred and George around.
“<PER>Cho</PER> will be playing, won’t <PER>Cho</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted.
<PER>Ron</PER> could not wish for better, and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> hoping against hope that <PER>Ron</PER> would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of “Weasley Is Our King.” Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George had left, was commentating as usual.
Bradley Davies Chang,” he said, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as <PER>Cho</PER> walked out onto the pitch, <PER>Cho</PER>'s shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze.
<PER>Cho</PER> was not sure what <PER>Cho</PER> wanted to happen anymore, except that <PER>Cho</PER> could not stand any more rows.
“And he’s scored.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors.
Predictably, horribly, the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing: Weasley cannot save a thing, Weasley cannot block a single ring “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said a hoarse voice in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s enormous bearded face sticking between the seats; apparently <PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> had squeezed <PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s way all along the row behind, for the first and second years <PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> had just passed had a ruffled, flattened look about them.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s gotta be now while ev’ryone’s lookin’ the other way Please?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s nose was gently dripping blood.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not seen <PER>Harry</PER> this close up since <PER>Harry</PER>'s return to the school; <PER>Harry</PER> looked utterly woebegone.
“ ’Course,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, “ ’course we’ll come” He and <PER>Hermione</PER> edged back along their row of seats, causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them.
The people in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s row were not complaining, merely attempting to make The people in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s row as small as possible.
“I jus’ hope she doesn’ notice us goin’” “You mean <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Give us more time ” “What is it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking up at him with a concerned expression on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face as they hurried across the lawn toward the edge of the forest.
When They reached his cabin, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned automatically left toward the front door; <PER>Hagrid</PER>, however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree.
“C’mon now, quick, before we’re spotted!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other, then ducked into the cover of the trees behind <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was already striding away from them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ran to catch up with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, why are you armed?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other, startled, but <PER>Hagrid</PER>, scowling, did not elaborate.
“Anyway,” he said, breathing a little more heavily than usual, “since then the other centaurs Ve bin livid with Ve bin an’ the trouble is, the other centaurs’ve got a lot of influence in the forest Cleverest creatures in here “Is that why we’re here, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
They were soon a long way past the clearing where <PER>Hagrid</PER> had shown them the thestrals, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt no sense of unease until <PER>Hagrid</PER> stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees toward the dark heart of the forest.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, fighting <PER>Harry</PER>'s way through thickly knotted brambles over which <PER>Hagrid</PER> had stepped easily and remembering very vividly what had happened to <PER>Harry</PER> on the other occasions <PER>Harry</PER> had stepped off the forest path.
“C’mon, <PER>Harry</PER> We need ter keep together now” It was a great struggle to keep up with <PER>Hagrid</PER>, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which <PER>Hagrid</PER> marched as easily as though they were cobwebs, but which snagged <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free they.
They were so deep in the forest now that sometimes all <PER>Harry</PER> could see of <PER>Hagrid</PER> in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him.
It occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature — their absence struck him as rather ominous.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, would it be all right if we lit our wands?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
“Before we ge’ there, like.” “Good!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> set her back on her feet.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> looked nervous and sad again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other, then back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What makes you think — ” “<PER>Umbridge</PER> reckons it was me that put tha’ niffler in her office.” “And was it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What do you want us to do?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> gave a great sniff and patted <PER>Harry</PER> wordlessly on the shoulder with such force that <PER>Harry</PER> was knocked sideways into a tree.
<PER>Harry</PER> had opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to ask how much farther they had to go when <PER>Hagrid</PER> threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop.
“Very quiet, now ” They crept forward and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they were facing a large, smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as <PER>Hagrid</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> thought, with a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal.
Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that Trees stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> now stood.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” her said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature, “who is he?” <PER>Harry</PER> found this an odd question “What is it?” was the one he had been planning on asking.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, you told us,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her wand now shaking in her hand, “you told us none of them wanted to come!” <PER>Harry</PER> looked from her to <PER>Hagrid</PER> and then, as realization hit <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror.
The great mound of earth, on which he, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> could easily have stood, was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep, grunting breathing.
“But I had ter bring him, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I had ter!” “But why?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, who sounded as though <PER>Hermione</PER> wanted to cry.
“Why — what — oh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>\” “I knew if I jus’ got him back,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, sounding close to tears himself, “an’ — an’ taught himself a few manners — I’d be able ter take ter outside an’ show ev’ryone ter’s harmless!” “Harmless!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrilly, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep.
“Oh <PER>Hagrid</PER>, why did you bring him back if him didn’t want to come, wouldn’t him have been happier with him's own people?” “They were all bullyin’ him, <PER>Hermione</PER>, ’cause he’s so small!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Small?” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, I couldn’ leave him,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, tears now trickling down him's bruised face into him's beard.
“See — him’s my brother!” <PER>Hermione</PER> simply stared at him, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth open.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, when you say ‘brother,’ ” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly, “do you mean — ?” “Well — half-brother,” amended <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees toward the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with <PER>Harry</PER>'s back to them.
“You have to keep <PER>Harry</PER> tied up?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> faintly.
“So what is it you want <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and me to do?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked apprehensively.
“After I’m gone.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged miserable looks, <PER>Harry</PER> uncomfortably aware that <PER>Harry</PER> had already promised <PER>Hagrid</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> would do whatever <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
What <PER>Harry</PER> had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound <PER>Harry</PER> now recognized as Grawp ’s head.
“You want us to teach <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said in a hollow voice.
Of course, the other creatures who lived in the forest would have heard <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English “Yeah — even if yeh jus’ talk ter him a bit,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> hopefully.
“ ’Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he’ll understand more that we all like he really, an’ want he to stay” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who peered back at <PER>Harry</PER> from between the fingers over her face.
“Yeh’ll do it, then?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who did not seem to have caught what <PER>Harry</PER> had just said.
“We’ll ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, already bound by <PER>Harry</PER>'s promise.
“We’ll try, <PER>Hagrid</PER>” “I knew I could count on yeh, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again.
“An’ I don’ wan’ yeh ter put yerself out too much, like I know yeh’ve got exams If yeh could jus’ nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an’ have a little chat with yeh I’ll wake yeh up, then — introduce you — ” “Wha — no!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, jumping up, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, no, don’t wake yeh, really, we don’t need — ” But “<PER>Hagrid</PER> had already stepped over the great trunk in front of them and was proceeding toward Grawp.
When “<PER>Hagrid</PER> was around ten feet away, “<PER>Hagrid</PER> lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled reassuringly over “<PER>Hagrid</PER>'s shoulder at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough.
In front of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push he onto his knees and turned his head to see who and what had disturbed he.
“Had a nice sleep, eh?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights.
“Oh my ” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> squeal, terrified, beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“This,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, hastening over to where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood, “is <PER>Harry</PER>, Grawp!
Turning to <PER>Hermione</PER> he said, “Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, <PER>Hermione</PER>?
“We’ll — er — We’ll go back now, shall We?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded.
And he had promised that he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> would continue <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s totally pointless attempts to civilize the giant How could <PER>Hagrid</PER>, even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were lovably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans?
“Hold it,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> abruptly, just as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised their wands; now that they had stopped walking, they too could hear movement close by.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized the black-bodied and bearded Bane, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had met nearly four years ago on the same night <PER>Harry</PER> had met Firenze.
“There can be no return from such disgrace.” “If yeh say so,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, shrugging, “but personally I think yeh ’re makin’ a big mistake — ” “As are you, human,” said Bane, “coming back into our forest when we warned you — ” “Now, you listen ter me,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> angrily.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as both Bane and the gray centaur pawed at the ground, “let’s go, please lets go!
“You’ll tolerate him as long as him’s here, it’s as much him's forest as yours!” he yelled, while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both pushed with all their might against <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forward.
“Ruddy old nags though, eh?” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, “if the centaurs don’t want humans in the forest, it doesn’t really look as though <PER>Harry</PER> and I will be able “Ah, you heard what they said,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> dismissively “they wouldn’t hurt foals — I mean, kids.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hermione</PER> looked much the worse for wear; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair was full of bits of twig and leaves, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face and arms.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> could look little better.
“Well see you later, then, <PER>Hagrid</PER>” “I don’t believe him,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a very unsteady voice, the moment they were out of earshot of <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“He’s not asking us to do anything unless He gets chucked out and that might not even happen — ” “Oh come off it, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily, stopping dead in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s tracks so that the people behind <PER>Hermione</PER>'s had to swerve to avoid <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Of course he’s going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest, after what we’ve just seen, who can blame <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” There was a pause in which <PER>Harry</PER> glared at her, and her eyes filled slowly with tears.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> ” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of “Weasley Is Our King” died away.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure whether it was <PER>Harry</PER>'s imagination or not, but <PER>Harry</PER> rather thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the treetops in the distance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch Cup was such that <PER>Ron</PER>’s could not settle to anything next day.
All he wanted to do was talk over the match and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp — not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring <PER>Ron</PER> back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion.
“And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later — what?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, stopping mid- sentence at the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
“Why are you grinning?” “I’m not,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s Transfiguration notes and attempting to straighten <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
The truth was that <PER>Ron</PER> had just reminded <PER>Harry</PER> forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree.
“Well, actually no, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a heavy sigh, putting down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s book and looking at him apologetically.
“As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match <PER>Harry</PER> and I saw was Davies’s first goal.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment.
“But <PER>Ron</PER>, we didn’t want to leave — we had to!” “Yeah?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose face was growing rather red.
“How come?” “It was <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And <PER>Hagrid</PER> wants us to ?” “Teach him English, yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the O.W.L.s from <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, though <PER>Harry</PER> did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told <PER>Snape</PER> that he must continue giving <PER>Harry</PER> Occlumency tuition: If he had, then <PER>Snape</PER> had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as <PER>Snape</PER> was now ignoring <PER>Harry</PER>.
This suited <PER>Harry</PER> very well; <PER>Harry</PER> was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with <PER>Snape</PER>, and to <PER>Harry</PER>'s relief <PER>Hermione</PER> was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency. ]
relief <PER>Hermione</PER> was spending a lot of time muttering to ] relief <PER>Hermione</PER> and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.
“How many hours d’you think you’re doing a day?” he demanded of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.
Meanwhile <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had found a different way to induce panic.
“Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran’s, and she’s never mentioned the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s.” “What’s she like, <PER>Neville</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> glanced at one another, but didn’t know what to say.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio’s Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine “Outstanding” O.W.L.s <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had gained the previous summer and was offering the whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons.
<PER>Ron</PER> assured <PER>Harry</PER> he would reimburse <PER>Harry</PER> for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, <PER>Hermione</PER> had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, we wanted to buy that!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It’s supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours — <PER>Hermione</PER>, let me have a pinch, go on, it can’t hurt — ” “This stuff can,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly.
“I’ve had a look at it, and it’s actually dried doxy droppings.” This information took the edge off <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s desire for brain stimulants.
“Excellent,” said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, “so we don’t have to worry about it till the holidays” <PER>Harry</PER> imagined sitting in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks’ time, waiting for his O.W.L.
<PER>Harry</PER> agreed to test <PER>Hermione</PER> after lunch on Sunday but regretted it almost at once.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from <PER>Harry</PER> to check that <PER>Hermione</PER> had gotten the answer completely right, finally hitting <PER>Harry</PER> hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day.
<PER>Umbridge</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hastened toward the double doors into the entrance hall, slowing down as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; <PER>Umbridge</PER> was speaking to her very deferentially.
“No idea where he is, I suppose?” “None at all,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, shooting a malevolent look at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as <PER>Ron</PER> pretended to do up his shoelace.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Harry</PER>'s careers consultation and <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s furious declaration that she would help <PER>Harry</PER> become an Auror if it was the last thing she did <PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally, one by one, none of the others in the dormitory fell asleep.
Parvati was practicing incantations under Parvati's breath while the salt cellar in front of Parvati's twitched, <PER>Hermione</PER> was rereading Achievement in Charming so fast that <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes appeared blurred, and <PER>Neville</PER> kept dropping <PER>Neville</PER>'s knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.
Then, at half-past nine, they were called forward class by class to reenter the Great Hall, which was now arranged exactly as <PER>Harry</PER> had seen it in the Pensieve when his father, Sirius, and <PER>Snape</PER> had been taking their O.W.L.s.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned over <PER>Harry</PER>'s paper, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart thumping hard Three rows to <PER>Harry</PER>'s right and four seats ahead, <PER>Hermione</PER> was already scribbling <PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes to the first question: a) Give the incantation, and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly <PER>Harry</PER> had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll Smiling slightly, <PER>Harry</PER> bent over the paper and began to write “Well, it wasn’t too bad, was it?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later, still clutching the paper.
Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had no idea how <PER>Hermione</PER> had done.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>’ll be fine — remember <PER>Hermione</PER> got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, “Parkinson, Pansy — Patil, Padma — Patil, Parvati — Potter, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Good luck,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked into the Great Hall, clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand so tightly <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand shook.
Professor Tofty pointed <PER>Harry</PER> toward what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner, who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“The famous Potter?” Out of the corner of his eye, <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> throw a scathing look over at <PER>Harry</PER>; the wine glass <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed.
“That’s it,” he said in his quavery old voice, “no need to be nervous Now, if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some cartwheels for me” On the whole <PER>Harry</PER> thought it went rather well; <PER>Harry</PER>'s Levitation Charm was certainly much better than <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s had been, though <PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had not mixed up the incantations for Color- Change and Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before <PER>Harry</PER> could rectify his mistake.
he was glad <PER>Hermione</PER> had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s afterward.
He could tell <PER>Ron</PER>, though; <PER>Ron</PER> had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to bed, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head buzzing with complex spell models and theories.
<PER>Harry</PER> forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during <PER>Harry</PER>'s written exam next morning, but thought <PER>Harry</PER>'s practical could have been a lot worse.
At least <PER>Harry</PER> managed to vanish the whole of <PER>Harry</PER>'s iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost Hannah Abbott's head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply Hannah Abbott's ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall.
the birds had the birds's Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> had done reasonably well) and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Here, for the first time, <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure <PER>Harry</PER> had passed.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining <PER>Harry</PER> again, when <PER>Harry</PER> demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell.
“Very well, Potter, you may go!” As <PER>Harry</PER> passed <PER>Umbridge</PER> beside the door their eyes met.
On Friday, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had a day off while <PER>Hermione</PER> sat <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front of them, them permitted them a break from studying.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> in the distance, teaching a class on the edge of the forest.
<PER>Harry</PER> was trying to guess what creatures they were examining <PER>Harry</PER> thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little — when the portrait hole opened and <PER>Hermione</PER> clambered in, looking thoroughly bad tempered.
“It means ‘partnership,’ not ‘defense,’ I mixed it up with ‘eihwaz.’ ” “Ah well,” said <PER>Ron</PER> lazily, “that’s only one mistake, isn’t it, you’ll still get — ” “Oh shut up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily, “it could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> thinks it’s <PER>Hagrid</PER> doing it, remember?
“Oh, you’re so naive sometimes, <PER>Harry</PER>, you really think <PER>Umbridge</PER> will wait for proof?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she swept off toward the girls’ dormitories, banging the door behind she.
“Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, very quietly, prodding his queen forward so that she could begin beating up one of <PER>Harry</PER>’s knights.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday studying for Potions on Monday, the exam to which <PER>Harry</PER> was looking forward least and which <PER>Harry</PER> was sure would be the one that would be the downfall of <PER>Harry</PER>'s ambitions to become an Auror.
Sure enough, <PER>Harry</PER> found the written exam difficult, though <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion: <PER>Harry</PER> could describe its effects extremely accurately, having taken its illegally in <PER>Harry</PER>'s second year.
<PER>Neville</PER>, who was sitting very near <PER>Harry</PER>, also looked happier than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen <PER>Harry</PER> during a Potions class.
“I’ve got Arithmancy and it’s probably the toughest subject there is!” Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so <PER>Hermione</PER> was unable to vent <PER>Hermione</PER>'s spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first years for giggling too loudly in the common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> was determined to perform well in Tuesday’s Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let <PER>Hagrid</PER> down.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> watching anxiously out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin window.
When <PER>Harry</PER>’s examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at him and told him him could leave, <PER>Harry</PER> gave <PER>Hagrid</PER> a fleeting thumbs-up before heading back up to the castle.
The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went well enough; <PER>Harry</PER> was not convinced <PER>Harry</PER> had got the names of all of Jupiter’s moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice.
<PER>Harry</PER> might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; <PER>Harry</PER> lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s head completely during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to <PER>Harry</PER> as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger, and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that her ought to have died the previous Tuesday.
He had just made <PER>Harry</PER> feel rather better by telling <PER>Harry</PER> how <PER>Harry</PER> told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look up and realize his had been describing his examiner’s reflection.
“No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly ” “And from now on, I don’t care if my tea leaves spell die, <PER>Ron</PER>, die — I’m just chucking them in the bin where them belong.” <PER>Harry</PER> laughed just as <PER>Hermione</PER> came running up behind them.
“Well, I think I’ve done all right in Arithmancy,” she said, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both sighed with relief.
As <PER>Harry</PER> completed the constellation Orion on <PER>Harry</PER>'s chart, however, the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where <PER>Harry</PER> was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced down as <PER>Harry</PER> made a slight adjustment to the position of <PER>Harry</PER>'s telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the front doors of the castle swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s telescope and refocused <PER>Harry</PER>'s telescope, now examining Venus.
Even at this distance, <PER>Harry</PER> had a funny feeling that <PER>Harry</PER> recognized the walk of the squattest among them, who seemed to be leading the group.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not think why <PER>Umbridge</PER> would be taking a stroll outside past midnight, much less accompanied by five others.
Then somebody coughed behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> was halfway through an exam.
<PER>Harry</PER> had quite forgotten Venus’s position — jamming <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye to <PER>Harry</PER>'s telescope, <PER>Harry</PER> found it again and was again on the point of entering it on <PER>Harry</PER>'s chart when, alert for any odd sound, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a distant knock that echoed through the deserted grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart hammering.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced around to see whether <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> had noticed what <PER>Harry</PER> had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind Professor Marchbanks at that moment, and not wanting to appear as though Professor Marchbanks was sneaking looks at anyone else’s work, he hastily bent over his star chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
Several of the people around <PER>Harry</PER> ducked out from behind the people around <PER>Harry</PER>'s telescopes and peered instead in the direction of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was gazing transfixed at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER> jumped and returned at once to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s star chart; <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own and noticed that <PER>Harry</PER> had mislabelled Venus as Mars.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's direction, seemed to be attempting to Stun <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
Cries and yells echoed across the grounds; a man yelled, “Be reasonable, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” and <PER>Hagrid</PER> roared, “Reasonable be damned, yeh won’ take me like this, Dawlish!” <PER>Harry</PER> could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend <PER>Hagrid</PER>, leaping at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and him fell to the ground.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, both hands over her mouth; <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER> and saw that <PER>Harry</PER> too was looking scared.
“How dare you!” “It’s <PER>McGonagall</PER>!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw him double over and thought for a moment that <PER>Harry</PER> had finally been overcome by a spell, but on the contrary, next moment <PER>Hagrid</PER> was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back — then <PER>Harry</PER> realized that Fang’s limp body was draped around <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders.
“Get <PER>Harry</PER>, get <PER>Harry</PER>!” screamed <PER>Umbridge</PER>, but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s fists.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck; <PER>Umbridge</PER> sent one last Stunning Spell after him but it missed, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, running full-pelt toward the distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.
When it came at last he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> did well, didn’t he?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked more alarmed than impressed.
“At least they didn’t get to take <PER>Hagrid</PER> off to Azkaban,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I ’spect he’s gone to join <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, hasn’t he?” “I suppose so,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked tearful.
“Oh, this is awful, I really thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would be back before long, but now we’ve lost <PER>Hagrid</PER> too” They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full.
Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, were now telling everyone what they had heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.
“It’s not like Trelawney, he’s been teaching much better than usual this year!” “<PER>Umbridge</PER> hates part-humans,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> bitterly, flopping down into an armchair.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> was always going to try and get <PER>Hagrid</PER> out.” “And <PER>Hermione</PER> thought <PER>Hagrid</PER> was putting nifflers in her office,” piped up Katie Bell.
“He was too close to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “That’s true,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sinking into an armchair beside <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt wide awake — the image of <PER>Hagrid</PER> sprinting away into the dark was haunting <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was so angry with <PER>Umbridge</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though <PER>Ron</PER>’s suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had its merits.
<PER>Harry</PER> would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but <PER>Harry</PER> had been counting on the morning for a spot of last- minute studying, so instead <PER>Harry</PER> sat with <PER>Harry</PER>'s head in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands by the common room window, trying hard not to doze off as <PER>Harry</PER> read through some of the notes stacked three-and-a-half feet high that <PER>Hermione</PER> had lent him.
<PER>Harry</PER> just wanted this to be over so that <PER>Harry</PER> could go and sleep.
Then tomorrow, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch — <PER>Harry</PER> was going to have a fly on <PER>Ron</PER>’s broom and savor their freedom from studying “Turn over your papers,” said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass.
I know this, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, though <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain felt torpid and slack.
<PER>Harry</PER> could visualize a heading, in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s handwriting: The Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards <PER>Harry</PER> had read these notes only this morning <PER>Harry</PER> began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks.
Once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved shis head very slightly and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a feeling it had something to do with trolls <PER>Harry</PER> gazed blankly at the back of Parvati ’s head again.
It did not seem very informative or detailed, yet he was sure <PER>Hermione</PER>’s notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages he closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember the confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had written that already Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted he had written that too And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come Think, he told he, his face in his hands, while all around he quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled through the hourglass at the front he was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last The black door swung open for he as usual, and here he was in the circular room with its many doors Straight across the stone floor and through the second door patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry he jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the others Once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass spheres he heart was beating very fast now he was going to get there this time When he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving upon the floor like a wounded animal <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach contracted with fear with excitement A voice issued from <PER>Harry</PER>'s own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human kindness, “Take it for me Lift it down, now I cannot touch it but you can” The black shape upon the floor shifted a little.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw a long-fingered white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own arm heard the high, cold voice say, “ Cruciol ” The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell back, writhing.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, the curse lifted, and the figure groaned and became motionless.
“Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> is waiting” Very slowly, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s arms trembling, the man on the ground raised Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s shoulders a few inches and lifted Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> hit the ground and awoke, still yelling, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar on fire, as the Great Hall erupted all around <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m — I’m fine, sir,” <PER>Harry</PER> stammered, wiping the sweat from <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Potter, what do you think you’re doing?” “I need to see Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,” gasped <PER>Harry</PER>, the breath tearing his lungs.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had gone, <PER>Hagrid</PER> had gone, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had always expected Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> to be there, irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly present “I don’t wonder you’re shocked, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in Madam Pomfrey's face.
He strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where He stood, buffeted by the crowd, the panic expanding inside He like poison gas so that He's head swam and He could not think what to do <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, said a voice in He's head.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once, looking very frightened.
“Come on, I’ve got to tell you something” He led them along the first-floor corridor, peering through doorways, and at last found an empty classroom into which He dived, closing the door behind <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the moment they were inside and leaning against it, facing they.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “G-get there?” “Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius!” <PER>Harry</PER> said loudly.
“But — <PER>Harry</PER> ” said <PER>Ron</PER> weakly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rather frightened voice, “er how how did <PER>Voldemort</PER> get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing <PER>Voldemort</PER> was there?” “How do I know?” bellowed <PER>Harry</PER>.
“The question is how we’re going to get in there!” “But <PER>Harry</PER>, think about this,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, taking a step toward him, “it’s five o’clock in the afternoon the Ministry of Magic must be full of workers How would <PER>Voldemort</PER> and Sirius have got in without being seen?
“Anyway, the Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever I’ve been — ” “You’ve never been there, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
“How d’you explain <PER>Ron</PER>’s dad then, what was all that about, how come I knew what had happened to him?” “He’s got a point,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, how on earth could <PER>Voldemort</PER> have got hold of Sirius when <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s been in Grimmauld Place all the time?” “Sirius might’ve cracked and just wanted some fresh air,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding worried.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s been desperate to get out of that house for ages — ” “But why,” <PER>Hermione</PER> persisted, “why on earth would <PER>Voldemort</PER> want to use “Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is?” “I dunno, there could be loads of reasons!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled at her.
“Maybe “Sirius is just someone <PER>Voldemort</PER> doesn’t care about seeing hurt — ” “You know what, I’ve just thought of something,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a hushed voice.
“Look, I’m sorry,” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but neither of you are making sense, and we’ve got no proof for any of this, no proof <PER>Voldemort</PER> and Sirius are even there — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s seen them!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, rounding on her.
I mean, it was really great of you and everything,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
“Everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do — ” “That’s funny,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a trembling voice, “because I definitely remember <PER>Ron</PER> saying I’d wasted time acting the hero Is that what you think this is?
“I’m trying to say — <PER>Voldemort</PER> knows you, <PER>Harry</PER>!
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve just said it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> fiercely.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> whipped around.
<PER>Ginny</PER> walked in, looking curious, followed by Luna, who as usual looked as though <PER>Ginny</PER> had drifted in accidentally.
“We recognized <PER>Harry</PER>’s voice — what are you yelling about?” “Never you mind,” said <PER>Harry</PER> roughly.
“Wait <PER>Harry</PER>, they can help.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at her.
“Listen,” she said urgently, “<PER>Harry</PER>, we need to establish whether Sirius really has left headquarters “I’ve told you, I saw — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m begging you, please!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> desperately.
“We haven’t got time to waste — ” “But if this is a trick of V-<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s — <PER>Harry</PER>, we’ve got to check, we’ve got to — ” “How?” <PER>Harry</PER> demanded.
“How’re we going to check?” “we’ll have to use <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s fire and see if we can contact him,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked positively terrified at the thought.
“Well draw <PER>Umbridge</PER> away again, but we’ll need lookouts, and that’s where we can use <PER>Ginny</PER> and Luna.” Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, <PER>Ginny</PER> said immediately, “Yeah, well do it,” and Luna said, “When you say ‘Sirius,’ are you talking about Stubby Boardman?” Nobody answered <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Okay,” <PER>Harry</PER> said aggressively to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Okay, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I’m with you, otherwise I’m going to the Department of Mysteries right now — ” “the Department of Mysteries?” said Luna, looking mildly surprised.
“Right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, twisting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands together and pacing up and down between the desks.
“Now, we need to keep students away from shis office while we force entry, or some Slytherin’s bound to go and tip shis off” “Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> promptly, “and warn people not to go down there because someone’s let off a load of Garroting Gas.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked surprised at the readiness with which <PER>Ginny</PER> had come up with this lie.
<PER>Ginny</PER> shrugged and said, “Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.” “Okay,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “well then, <PER>Harry</PER>, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak, and we’ll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius — ” “He’s not there, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” “I mean, you can — can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don’t think you should be in there alone, Lee’s already proved the window’s a weak spot, sending those nifflers through it.” Even through Lee’s's anger and impatience <PER>Harry</PER> recognized <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s offer to accompany <PER>Harry</PER> into <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty.
“Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don’t think we’re going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking relieved that <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to have accepted the plan, “not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.” “Five minutes’ll be enough,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we’ll meet you at the end of <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s corridor, okay?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer, but flung okay?” <PER>Harry</PER> out of the room and began to fight okay?” <PER>Harry</PER>'s way through the milling crowds outside.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius’s knife secure in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, before they noticed <PER>Harry</PER> had left they.
“So <PER>Ron</PER> — you go and head <PER>Umbridge</PER> off <PER>Ginny</PER>, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor <PER>Harry</PER> and I will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear” <PER>Ron</PER> strode away, his bright red hair visible right to the end of the passage.
“Get over here,” muttered <PER>Hermione</PER>, tugging at <PER>Harry</PER>’s wrist and pulling <PER>Harry</PER> back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column.
It had hurt much worse than this when <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been punishing Avery “Here,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said.
When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, <PER>Hermione</PER> said quietly, “I think that’s as good as we’re going to get, <PER>Harry</PER> — come on, let’s do it.” Together they moved forward, covered by the cloak.
As they passed <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, “Good one don’t forget the signal ” “What’s the signal?” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, as they approached <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s door.
“A loud chorus of Weasley Is Our King’ if they see <PER>Umbridge</PER> coming,” replied <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> inserted the blade of Sirius’s knife in the crack between door and wall.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand out.
<PER>Harry</PER> knelt down quickly, thrust <PER>Harry</PER>'s head into the dancing fire, and cried, “Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!” <PER>Harry</PER> head began to spin as though <PER>Harry</PER> had just got off a fairground ride though <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees remained firmly planted upon the cold office floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes screwed up against the whirling ash, and when the spinning stopped, <PER>Harry</PER> opened them to find <PER>Harry</PER> looking out upon the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place.
“I’m warning you!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, fully aware that <PER>Harry</PER>'s scope for inflicting punishment upon Kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position.
<PER>Harry</PER> could just make out the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bald head through the forest of chair legs before <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You — !” But before he could utter a single curse or insult, <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great pain at the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> inhaled a lot of ash and, choking, found <PER>Harry</PER> being dragged backward through the flames until, with a horrible abruptness, <PER>Harry</PER> was staring up into the wide, pallid face of Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who had dragged <PER>Harry</PER> backward out of the fire by the hair and was now bending <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck back as far as it would go as though she was going to slit <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“You think,” she whispered, bending <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck back even farther, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s was looking up at the ceiling above him, “that after two nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge?
“Hers too ” <PER>Harry</PER> heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that <PER>Hermione</PER> had just had <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand wrested from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s as well.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was leaning on the windowsill, smirking as he threw <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand into the air one- handed and then caught it again.
There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered, each gripping <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Luna, and — to <PER>Harry</PER>’s bewilderment — <PER>Neville</PER>, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation.
“ That one.” he poked a thick finger at <PER>Neville</PER>, “tried to stop me taking her,” he pointed at <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her, “so I brought him along too.” “Good, good,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, watching <PER>Ginny</PER>’s struggles.
“You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon,” she nodded at <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> laughed even louder, “to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mister Filch having just informed me so.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> was so full of rage and hatred <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s lip was bleeding onto <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s carpet as <PER>Ron</PER>’s lip struggled against Warrington’s half nelson.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was still trying to stamp on the feet of the sixth-year girl who had both <PER>Ginny</PER>'s upper arms in a tight grip.
<PER>Neville</PER> was turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at Crabbe’s arms, and <PER>Hermione</PER> was attempting vainly to throw Millicent Bulstrode off <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who was watching <PER>Harry</PER> closely.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> came back into the room, holding open the door for <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Ah, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, smiling widely and standing up again.
<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thought desperately.
<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s got Sirius — “You are on probation!” shrieked Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER> looked back at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyebrows slightly raised.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER>'s last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door.
“He’s got Padfoot at the place where it’s hidden!” <PER>Snape</PER> had stopped with <PER>Snape</PER>'s hand on <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s door handle.
“Padfoot?” cried Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, looking eagerly from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not tell whether <PER>Harry</PER> had understood or not, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare speak more plainly in front of <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt horribly powerless without <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand as <PER>Harry</PER> watched her.
“You are forcing me, Potter I do not want to,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, still moving restlessly on the spot, “but sometimes circumstances justify the use I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice” <PER>Malfoy</PER> was watching her with a hungry expression on his face.
“Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> — it’s illegal” — but <PER>Umbridge</PER> took no notice.
“The Minister wouldn’t want you to break the law, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>!” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What <PER>Cornelius</PER> doesn’t know won’t hurt What <PER>Cornelius</PER>,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who was now panting slightly as she pointed shis wand at different parts of <PER>Harry</PER>’s body in turn, apparently trying to decide what would hurt the most.
“<PER>Harry</PER> never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last summer, but <PER>Harry</PER> was delighted to be given the chance to expel <PER>Harry</PER>, all the same” “It was you?” gasped <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ You sent the dementors after me?” “ Somebody had to act,” breathed <PER>Umbridge</PER>, as her wand came to rest pointing directly at <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“No — <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER>, well have to tell her!” “No way!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at the little of <PER>Hermione</PER> he could see.
“We’ll have to, <PER>Harry</PER>, shell force it out of you anyway, what’s what’s the point ?” And <PER>Hermione</PER> began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode ’s robes.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was staring at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though <PER>Ginny</PER> had never seen <PER>Ginny</PER>'s before; <PER>Neville</PER>, still choking for breath, was gazing at <PER>Ginny</PER>'s too.
Though <PER>Hermione</PER> was sobbing desperately into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands, there was no trace of a tear “I’m — I’m sorry everyone,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But — I can’t stand it — ■” “That’s right, that’s right, girl!” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, seizing <PER>Hermione</PER> by the shoulders, thrusting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Now then with whom was Potter communicating just now?” “Well,” gulped <PER>Hermione</PER> into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands, “well, he was trying to speak to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>” <PER>Ron</PER> froze, his eyes wide; <PER>Ginny</PER> stopped trying to stamp on her Slytherin captor’s toes; even Luna looked mildly surprised.
Fortunately, the attention of <PER>Umbridge</PER> and her minions was focused too exclusively upon <PER>Hermione</PER> to notice these suspicious signs.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> eagerly.
“You know where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is, then?” “Well no!” sobbed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“We’ve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog’s Head — ” “Idiot girl, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’t be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry’s looking for him!” shouted <PER>Umbridge</PER>, disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face.
“But — but we needed to tell him something important!” wailed <PER>Hermione</PER>, holding <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands more tightly over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face, not, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears.
“What’s ready?” demanded <PER>Umbridge</PER>, and now <PER>Umbridge</PER> grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulders again and shook <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s slightly.
“But he had to leave before it was finished and n-n-now we’ve finished it for he, and we c-c-can’t find him t-t-to tell he!” “What kind of weapon is it?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> harshly, her stubby hands still tight on <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulders.
“We j-j-just did what P-P-Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told us t-t-to do ” <PER>Umbridge</PER> straightened up, looking exultant.
‘Tm not showing them,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrilly, looking around at the Slytherins through <PER>Hermione</PER> shrilly's fingers.
“Fine,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now sobbing into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands again, “fine let them see it, I hope them use it on you!
<PER>Umbridge</PER> contemplated <PER>Hermione</PER> for another long moment and then spoke in what She clearly thought was a motherly voice.
“And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand.
“Lead on” <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea what <PER>Hermione</PER> was planning, or even whether <PER>Hermione</PER> had a plan.
It seemed incredible to <PER>Harry</PER> that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world <PER>Hermione</PER> walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air.
The sun was falling toward the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now as <PER>Hermione</PER> marched purposefully across the grass, <PER>Umbridge</PER> jogging to keep up.
“It’s hidden in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, is it?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> eagerly in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> might have set it off accidentally.” “Yes,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, whose excitement seemed to be mounting.
<PER>Harry</PER> scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as <PER>Harry</PER> knew it would if <PER>Voldemort</PER> had moved in for the kill “Then where is it?” asked <PER>Umbridge</PER>, with a hint of uncertainty in <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s voice as <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to stride toward the forest.
“No, I don’t think so, Potter,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> sweetly, poking <PER>Harry</PER> in the back with it.
“The Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours, I’m afraid.” As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to catch <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s eye; walking into the forest without wands seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening.
She, however, merely gave <PER>Umbridge</PER> a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that <PER>Umbridge</PER>, with Shis shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had not been with him on that occasion; him doubted <PER>Hermione</PER> had any idea what danger lay at the end of it.
Neither of them paused to help her up again; <PER>Hermione</PER> merely strode on, calling loudly over her shoulder, “It’s a bit further in!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, keep your voice down,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, hurrying to catch up with “<PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the feeling <PER>Harry</PER> had had before in the forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes “How much further?” demanded <PER>Umbridge</PER> angrily from behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel the forest floor trembling; <PER>Umbridge</PER> gave a little scream and pushed <PER>Harry</PER> in front of her like a shield — <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched <PER>Harry</PER> free of her and turned.
Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who backed slowly into the center of the clearing, <PER>Umbridge</PER> uttering odd little whimpers of terror.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
On <PER>Harry</PER>’s right, <PER>Umbridge</PER> was still whimpering, her wand trembling violently as her pointed it at the advancing centaur.
“I am Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>!” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> in a high- pitched, terrified voice.
“Don’t call them that!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said furiously, but <PER>Umbridge</PER> did not appear to have heard <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Still pointing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shaking wand at Magorian, <PER>Hermione</PER> continued, “Law Fifteen B states clearly that ‘Any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions — ’ ” “ ‘Near-human intelligence’?” repeated Magorian, as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> and pulled <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to the ground.
Lifting his head a few inches, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Umbridge</PER> had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright.
“Now!” roared a voice in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged <PER>Harry</PER> upright; <PER>Hermione</PER> too had been pulled to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet.
Over the plunging, many-colored backs and heads of the centaurs <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Umbridge</PER> being borne away through the trees by Bane, still screaming nonstop; her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them.
“We do not attack foals.” “They brought her here, <PER>Ron</PER>an,” replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And they are not so young He is nearing manhood, this one” He shook <PER>Harry</PER> by the neck of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Please,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly, “please, don’t attack us, us don’t think like <PER>Hermione</PER>, us aren’t Ministry of Magic employees!
“We do not help humans!” snarled the centaur holding <PER>Harry</PER>, tightening <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet left the ground momentarily.
A bearded centaur toward the back of the crowd shouted, “They came here unasked, They must pay the consequences!” A roar of approval met these words and a dun-colored centaur shouted, “They can join the woman!” “You said you didn’t hurt the innocent!” shouted <PER>Hermione</PER>, real tears sliding down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face now.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s centaur let <PER>Harry</PER> fall to the ground again as <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands flew to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bow and quiver of arrows; <PER>Hermione</PER> had been dropped too, and <PER>Harry</PER> hurried toward <PER>Hermione</PER>'s as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap.
“Hagger.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what “hagger” meant, or what language it was from, nor did <PER>Harry</PER> much care — <PER>Harry</PER> was watching Grawp ’s feet, which were almost as long as <PER>Harry</PER>’s whole body.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose huge, round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Hermione</PER> shaking as Grawp opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling voice, “Hermy.” “Goodness,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint, “he — he remembered!” “Hermy!” roared Grawp.
Wandless, <PER>Harry</PER> braced <PER>Harry</PER> to punch, kick, bite, or whatever else it took as the hand flew toward <PER>Harry</PER> and knocked a snow- white centaur off <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs.
It was what the centaurs had been waiting for — Grawp’s outstretched fingers were a foot from <PER>Harry</PER> when fifty arrows went soaring through the air at the giant, peppering <PER>Harry</PER>'s enormous face, causing <PER>Harry</PER> to howl with pain and rage and straighten up again, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s face with <PER>Harry</PER>'s enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the heads in still deeper.
<PER>Harry</PER> yelled and stamped <PER>Harry</PER>'s enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way.
Pebble-sized droplets of Grawp’s blood showered <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Hermione</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet and the pair of them ran as fast as them could for the shelter of the trees.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched, — Grawp gave another roar of fury and plunged after them, smashing more trees aside as he went.
“Oh no,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, quaking so badly that <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knees gave way.
As <PER>Harry</PER> listened to them <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him.
Not only had <PER>Harry</PER> managed to lose <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever.
“By the time we’ve done that, Sirius 11 probably be dead!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, kicking a nearby tree in temper; there was a high-pitched chattering overhead and <PER>Harry</PER> looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, we can’t do anything without wands,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hopelessly, dragging <PER>Hermione</PER> up again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved instinctively together, peering through the trees, as <PER>Ron</PER> came into sight, with <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna hurrying along behind him.
All of them looked a little the worse for wear — there were several long scratches running the length of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s cheek, a large purple lump was swelling above <PER>Neville</PER>’s right eye, <PER>Ron</PER>’s lip was bleeding worse than ever — but all were looking rather pleased with themselves.
“So,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, “had any ideas?” “How did you get away?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> in amazement, taking <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand from <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, <PER>Neville</PER> brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,” said <PER>Ron</PER> airily, now handing back <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand too.
“But <PER>Ginny</PER> was best, <PER>Ginny</PER> got <PER>Malfoy</PER> — Bat-Bogey Hex — it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great flapping things.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s little brother,” said <PER>Ron</PER> promptly.
“Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> irritably, rounding on her, “first of all, “we’ aren’t doing anything if you’re including yourself in that, and second of all, <PER>Ron</PER>’s the only one with a broomstick that isn’t being guarded by a security troll, so — ” “I’ve got a broom!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>'s jaw set so that <PER>Ginny</PER>'s resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking.
“I’m three years older than you were when you fought <PER>Voldemort</PER> over the Sorcerer’s Stone,” she said fiercely, “and it’s because of me <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s stuck back in <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office with giant flying bogeys attacking him — ” “Yeah, but — ” “We were all in the D.A.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes met <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
in addition to himself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius, him would not have picked <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, or Luna.
“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can’t fly,” said Luna in a dignified voice, “but they can, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> says they’re very good at finding places their riders are looking for.” <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around.
They tossed They's reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and <PER>Harry</PER> stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand eagerly and patted the nearest one’s shining neck.
“Is it those mad horse things?” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the thestral <PER>Harry</PER> was patting.
“Four, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, scowling.
“Look, you three” — <PER>Harry</PER> pointed at <PER>Neville</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna — “you’re not involved in this, you’re not — ” They burst into more protests.
“But unless we can find more thestrals you’re not going to be able — ” “Oh, more of them will come,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> confidently, who like <PER>Ron</PER> was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that <PER>Ginny</PER> was looking at the horses.
“What makes you think that?” “Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and <PER>Hermione</PER> are both covered in blood,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said coolly, “and we know <PER>Hagrid</PER> lures thestrals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the first place” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a soft tug on <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest thestral licking <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleeve, which was damp with Grawp’s blood.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and I will take these two and go ahead, and <PER>Hermione</PER> can stay here with you three and <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll attract more thestrals — ” “I’m not staying behind!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> furiously.
He had no excuse now “All right,” He said angrily, “pick one and get on, then.” <PER>Harry</PER> wound <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand tightly into the mane of the nearest thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby, and scrambled clumsily onto the horse’s silken back.
<PER>Neville</PER> had heaved <PER>Neville</PER> over the back of the next thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature’s back.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, openmouthed and staring.
“When we can’t see the things?” “Oh it’s easy,” said Luna, sliding obligingly from her thestral and marching over to him, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended, the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast and so steeply that <PER>Harry</PER> had to clench <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backward over its bony rump.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not think <PER>Harry</PER> had ever moved so fast: The thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating.
The cooling air was slapping <PER>Harry</PER>’s face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, <PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s five fellows soaring along behind <PER>Harry</PER>, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of them's thestral to protect them from its slipstream.
In the falling darkness <PER>Harry</PER> saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills “This is bizarre!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> yell from somewhere behind him, and him imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support Twilight fell: The sky turned to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon it was only the lights of Muggle towns that gave them any clue of how far from the ground them were or how very fast them were traveling.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s arms were wrapped tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>'s horse’s neck as <PER>Harry</PER> willed it to go even faster.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as <PER>Voldemort</PER> wanted, nor died, for <PER>Voldemort</PER> was convinced that either outcome would cause <PER>Voldemort</PER> to feel <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s jubilation or fury course through <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own body, making <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Arthur was attacked On they flew through the gathering darkness; <PER>Harry</PER>’s face felt stiff and cold, <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs numb from gripping the thestral’s sides so tightly, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare shift positions lest <PER>Harry</PER> slip <PER>Harry</PER> was deaf from the thundering in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears and <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth was dry and frozen from the rush of cold night air.
<PER>Harry</PER> had lost all sense of how far they had come; all <PER>Harry</PER>'s faith was in the beast below <PER>Harry</PER>, still streaking purposefully through the night, barely flapping its wings as its sped ever onward If they were too late <PER>Harry</PER>’s still alive, <PER>Harry</PER>’s still fighting, I can feel it If <PER>Voldemort</PER> decided Sirius was not going to crack I’d know <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach gave a jolt.
<PER>Harry</PER> gripped the thestral with every last ounce of <PER>Harry</PER>'s strength, braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and <PER>Harry</PER> slid from <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, looking around at the street where the overflowing dumpster still stood a short way from the vandalized telephone box, both drained of color in the flat orange glare of the streetlights.
“Never, ever again that was the worst — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> touched down on either side of him.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> marched in obediently; <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna squashed <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna in after <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna; <PER>Harry</PER> took one glance back at the thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the dumpster, then forced <PER>Harry</PER> into the box after Luna.
<PER>Hermione</PER> scooped them up and handed them mutely to <PER>Harry</PER> over <PER>Ginny</PER> ’s head; he glanced at the topmost one.
“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.” “Fine!” <PER>Harry</PER> said loudly, as <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar gave another throb.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and held <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand as ready as <PER>Harry</PER> could in such cramped conditions, peering through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed to be completely empty.
The door of the telephone box burst open; <PER>Harry</PER> toppled out of it, followed by <PER>Neville</PER> and Luna.
“Come on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall, <PER>Harry</PER> in the lead, past the fountain, toward the desk where the security man who had weighed <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had sat and which was now deserted.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt sure that there ought to be a security person there, sure that their absence was an ominous sign, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the day that <PER>Harry</PER> had come with Arthur — <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that the din would raise every security person within the building, yet when the lift halted, the cool female voice said, “Department of Mysteries,” and the grilles slid open again, they stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of air from the lift.
After months and months of dreaming about it, <PER>Harry</PER> was here at last “Let’s go,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, and <PER>Harry</PER> led the way down the corridor, Luna right behind him, gazing around with her mouth slightly open.
“Maybe maybe a couple of people should stay here as a — as a lookout, and — ” “And how’re we going to let you know something’s coming?” asked <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>'s eyebrows raised.
“You could be miles away.” “We’re coming with you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> still did not want to take them all with <PER>Harry</PER>, but it seemed <PER>Harry</PER> had no choice.
Just as it had in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dream, it swung open and <PER>Harry</PER> marched forward, leading the others over the threshold.
<PER>Harry</PER> regretted giving this order the moment <PER>Neville</PER> had obeyed this order.
<PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm as though frightened the floor might move too, but it did not.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all <PER>Harry</PER> could see.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized at once that she was right: <PER>Harry</PER> could no sooner have picked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-black floor.
“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” said <PER>Harry</PER> forcefully, blinking to try and erase the blue lines from <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision, and clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand tighter than ever.
“We won’t need to get out till We’ve found Sirius — ” “Don’t go calling for <PER>Harry</PER>, though!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said urgently, but <PER>Harry</PER> had never needed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s advice less; <PER>Harry</PER>'s instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for the time being.
“Where do we go, then, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked.
After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter, though there were no glittering, shimmering lights such as <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dreams.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled down the benches one by one until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit.
<PER>Harry</PER> footsteps echoed loudly as <PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly toward the dais.
The pointed archway looked much taller from where <PER>Harry</PER> stood now than when <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking down on it from above.
“Sirius?” <PER>Harry</PER> spoke again, but much more quietly now that <PER>Harry</PER> was nearer.
Gripping <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand very tightly, <PER>Harry</PER> edged around the dais, but there was nobody there.
“This isn’t right, <PER>Harry</PER>, come on, let’s go” She sounded scared, much more scared than She had in the room where the brains swam, yet <PER>Harry</PER> thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it, old though it was.
The gently rippling veil intrigued <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let’s go, okay?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> more forcefully.
“Nobody’s talking, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now moving over to him.
“Is that you, <PER>Ron</PER>?” “I’m here, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, appearing around the side of the archway.
“Can’t anyone else hear it?” <PER>Harry</PER> demanded, for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put it there, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot was on the dais.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to — well, come on, then!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way back around the dais.
On the other side, <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil too.
Without speaking, <PER>Hermione</PER> took hold of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s arm, <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Neville</PER>’s, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door.
“What d’you reckon that arch was?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> as they regained the dark circular room.
“It’s locked ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, throwing <PER>Harry</PER>'s weight at the door, but it did not budge.
“This is it, then, isn’t it?” said <PER>Ron</PER> excitedly, joining <PER>Harry</PER> in the attempt to force the door open.
<PER>Hermione</PER> pointed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said, “Alohomora\” Nothing happened.
“Sirius’s knife!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled it out from inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall.
What was more, when <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the knife, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that the blade had melted.
“It can’t be, <PER>Harry</PER> could get through all the doors in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dream,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, marking the door with another fiery cross as <PER>Harry</PER> replaced the now-useless handle of Sirius’s knife in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket.
“Something blibbering, no doubt,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath, and <PER>Neville</PER> gave a nervous little laugh.
As <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes became more accustomed to the brilliant glare <PER>Harry</PER> saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfather and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching footsteps.
“This way!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart was pumping frantically now that <PER>Harry</PER> knew they were on the right track.
<PER>Harry</PER> led the way forward down the narrow space between the lines of the desks, heading, as <PER>Harry</PER> had done in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dream, for the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as <PER>Harry</PER> was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering wind.
“Keep going!” said <PER>Harry</PER> sharply, because <PER>Ginny</PER> showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg’s progress back into a bird.
“This is it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said again, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was now pumping so hard and fast <PER>Harry</PER> felt it must interfere with <PER>Harry</PER>'s speech.
“Anywhere here really close ” “<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively, but “<PER>Harry</PER>?
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> again.
This was where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, had seen <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down them.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> called.
“What?” He did not want to hear what <PER>Ron</PER> had to say, did not want to hear <PER>Ron</PER> tell He He had been stupid, or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but eagerly this time — it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there, a clue — he strode back to where they were all standing, a little way down row ninety-seven, but found nothing except <PER>Ron</PER> staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelves.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter <PER>Harry</PER> stared at it.
“None of the rest of us are here” “<PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t think you should touch it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply, as he stretched out his hand.
“It’s something to do with me, isn’t it?” “Don’t, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> suddenly.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s looked as though <PER>Neville</PER>’s could not take much more suspense.
And feeling slightly reckless, <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers around the dusty ball’s surface.
The others moved in closer around <PER>Harry</PER>, gazing at the orb as <PER>Harry</PER> brushed it free of the clogging dust.
“To me, Potter,” repeated the drawling voice of Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> as Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> held out Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hand, palm up.
A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to <PER>Harry</PER>’s left said triumphantly, “The Dark Lord always knows!” “Always,” echoed <PER>Malfoy</PER> softly.
the woman and the woman's fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from <PER>Harry</PER> and the others, the light from their wands dazzling <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes.
“You’ve got him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ignoring the rising panic in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest, the dread <PER>Harry</PER> had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ron</PER> stir beside him.
“Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.” “Go on, then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand to chest height.
As he did so, the five wands of <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna rose on either side of him.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s arm was pressed against <PER>Neville</PER>’s, and <PER>Neville</PER>’s could feel <PER>Neville</PER>’s shaking.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s could feel one of the other’s quickened breath on the back of <PER>Neville</PER>’s's head.
“You jest, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” “Nope, not jesting,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, maintaining <PER>Harry</PER>'s tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m not playing games,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, half <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind on the conversation, half on <PER>Harry</PER>'s wandering foot.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> sneeringly.
“I — what?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> quite forgot <PER>Harry</PER>'s plan.
“What about my scar?” “ What?” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER> more urgently behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Can this be?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of some of the Death Eaters's laughter, <PER>Harry</PER> hissed to <PER>Hermione</PER>, moving <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips as little as possible, “Smash shelves — ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told you?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> repeated.
“Well, this explains why you didn’t come earlier, Potter, <PER>Voldemort</PER> wondered why — ” “ — when I say go — ” “ — you didn’t come running when <PER>Voldemort</PER> showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams.
“Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as <PER>Voldemort</PER> discovered when <PER>Voldemort</PER> attempted to use others to steal it for him.” “And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?” “About both of you, Potter, about both of you Haven’t you ever wondered why <PER>Voldemort</PER> tried to kill you as a baby?” <PER>Harry</PER> stared into the slitted eyeholes through which <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s gray eyes were gleaming.
Was this prophecy the reason <PER>Harry</PER>’s parents had died, the reason <PER>Harry</PER> carried <PER>Harry</PER>'s lightning-bolt scar?
“Someone made a prophecy about <PER>Voldemort</PER> and me?” Someone said quietly, gazing at Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Someone's fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in Someone's hand.
“But <PER>Voldemort</PER> knows you are not unintell — ” “NOW!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>.
The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, pearly-white figures's voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor — “RUN!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above, <PER>Harry</PER> seized a handful of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s robes and dragged <PER>Hermione</PER>'s forward, one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them.
They were all yelling, there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres — <PER>Harry</PER> found the way ahead clear and saw <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear footsteps right behind him and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice urging <PER>Neville</PER> on.
The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> could see the glittering light of the bell jar, <PER>Harry</PER> pelted through the glittering light of the bell jar, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them — “ Colloportus\” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER> and the door sealed “ Colloportus\” with an odd squelching noise.
He had thought that <PER>Ron</PER>, Luna, and <PER>Ginny</PER> had been ahead of them, that them would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there.
“They must have gone the wrong way!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, terror in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> roar: “Leave Nott, leave Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I say, <PER>Voldemort</PER> will not care for Nott’s injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson, come back here, we need to organize!
They were almost there when <PER>Harry</PER> heard something large and heavy collide with the door <PER>Hermione</PER> had charmed shut.
“Alohomora\” As the door flew open, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> dived under desks.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters’ robes drawing nearer, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>'s feet moving rapidly.
Poking <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand out from under the desk <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; <PER>Harry</PER> fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked a grandfather clock over.
The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid <PER>Harry</PER>’s spell and now pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim.
“Avada — ” <PER>Harry</PER> launched Avada — ” <PER>Harry</PER> across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing Avada — ” <PER>Harry</PER> to topple and Avada — ” <PER>Harry</PER>'s aim to go awry.
<PER>Neville</PER> overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, “EXPELLIARMUS\” Both <PER>Harry</PER>’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of Both <PER>Harry</PER>’s and the Death Eater’s wands's hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to both's feet and charged after both, the Death Eater in front and <PER>Harry</PER> hot on <PER>Harry</PER>'s heels, <PER>Neville</PER> bringing up the rear, plainly horrors truck at what <PER>Neville</PER> had done.
“Get out of the way, <PER>Harry</PER>!” yelled <PER>Neville</PER>, clearly determined to repair the damage.
<PER>Harry</PER> flung <PER>Harry</PER> sideways as <PER>Neville</PER> took aim again and shouted, “ STUPEFY !” The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater’s shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses.
<PER>Harry</PER> ducked down behind another desk as the man turned — his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, “STUP — “STUPEFY]” screamed <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had just caught up with them.
<PER>Harry</PER> expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor, but instead, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and <PER>Harry</PER> came to rest, sprawled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on the table, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and her threw it to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand but to <PER>Harry</PER>'s amazement <PER>Hermione</PER> seized his arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and knew, too late, that <PER>Harry</PER> ought not to have shouted and given away their position.
“Collo — ” began <PER>Hermione</PER>, but before <PER>Hermione</PER> could complete the spell the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside.
With a cry of triumph, both yelled, “ IMPEDIMENT A\” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> were all knocked backward off their feet.
<PER>Neville</PER> was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view, <PER>Hermione</PER> smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head slammed into the stone wall behind <PER>Harry</PER>, tiny lights burst in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, and for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> was too dizzy and bewildered to react.
“WEVE GOT HIM!” yelled the Death Eater nearest <PER>Harry</PER>, “IN AN OFFICE OFF — ” “ Silenciol ” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the man’s voice was extinguished.
It passed right across <PER>Hermione</PER>’s chest; the Death Eater <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a tiny “oh!” as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where the Death Eater <PER>Hermione</PER> lay motionless.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees beside her as <PER>Neville</PER> crawled rapidly toward her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of his.
The Death Eater kicked out hard at <PER>Neville</PER>’s head as The Death Eater emerged — The Death Eater's foot broke <PER>Neville</PER>’s wand in two and connected with his face — <PER>Neville</PER> gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching — <PER>Neville</PER>'s mouth and nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> twisted around, <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand held high, and saw that The Death Eater had ripped off <PER>Harry</PER>'s mask and was pointing his wand directly at <PER>Harry</PER>, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts.
With his free hand, his pointed from the prophecy still clutched in <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, to <PER>Harry</PER>, then at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
A whine of panic inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was preventing <PER>Harry</PER> thinking properly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had one hand on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s properly.
Don’t let her be dead, don’t let her be dead, it’s my fault if her’s dead “Whaddever you do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> fiercely from under the desk, lowering <PER>Neville</PER>'s hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, “don’d gib it to his!” Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around his.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said at once, shaking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, wake up” “Whaddid “Whaddid do to <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Neville</PER>, crawling out from under the desk again to kneel at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s other side, blood streaming from “Whaddid's rapidly swelling nose.
“I dunno” <PER>Neville</PER> groped for <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wrist.
“Dat’s a pulse, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’b sure id is” Such a powerful wave of relief swept through <PER>Harry</PER> that for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> felt light-headed.
“She’s alive?” “Yeah, I dink so” There was a pause in which <PER>Harry</PER> listened hard for the sounds of more footsteps, but all <PER>Harry</PER> could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby Death Eater in the next room.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, we’re not far from the exit,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
“We’re right next to that circular room If we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I’ll bet you can get <PER>Hermione</PER> up the corridor and into the lift Then you could find someone Raise the alarm ” “And whad are you going do do?” said <PER>Neville</PER>, mopping <PER>Neville</PER>'s bleeding nose with <PER>Neville</PER>'s sleeve and frowning at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Hermione</PER> — ” “We’ll dake her wid us,” said <PER>Neville</PER> firmly.
“I’ll carry her — you’re bedder at fighding dem dan I ab — ” He stood up and seized one of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms, glared at <PER>Harry</PER>, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist <PER>Hermione</PER>’s limp form over <PER>Neville</PER>’s shoulders.
“Wait,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, snatching up <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand from the floor and shoving it into <PER>Neville</PER>s hand, “you’d better take this” <PER>Neville</PER> kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly toward the door.
“My gran’s going do kill be,” said <PER>Neville</PER> thickly, blood spattering from his nose as his spoke, “dat was by dad’s old wand” <PER>Harry</PER> stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously.
They walked a few steps forward, <PER>Neville</PER> tottering slightly due to <PER>Hermione</PER>’s weight.
The recent blow on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head seemed to have unsteadied <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> narrowed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again.
With a sinking heart <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hermione</PER>’s fiery crosses had faded from the doors.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” croaked <PER>Harry</PER>, dashing toward them.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — are you all — ?” “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes and gazing at <PER>Harry</PER> with unfocused eyes.
“There you are Ha ha ha You look funny, <PER>Harry</PER> You’re all messed up <PER>Ron</PER>’s face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth.
“What happened?” But <PER>Ginny</PER> shook <PER>Ginny</PER>'s head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle.
“Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very odd place, some of the time us were just floating in the dark — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, we saw Uranus up close!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, still giggling feebly.
“Anyway, one of them grabbed <PER>Ginny</PER>’s foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but ” Luna gestured hopelessly at <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed.
“And what about <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> fearfully, as <PER>Ron</PER> continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes.
“I don’t know what they hit him with,” said Luna sadly, “but him’s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all” “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, “you know who this girl is, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Luna, can you help <PER>Ginny</PER>?” “Yes,” said Luna, sticking Luna's wand behind Luna's ear for safekeeping, putting an arm around <PER>Ginny</PER>’s waist and pulling <PER>Ginny</PER>'s up.
“It’s only my ankle, I can do it myself!” said <PER>Ginny</PER> impatiently, but next moment <PER>Ginny</PER> had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder just as, so many months ago, <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled <PER>Dudley</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around: They had a one-in-twelve chance of getting the exit right the first time — <PER>Harry</PER> heaved <PER>Ron</PER> toward a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped into the hall, led by Bellatrix Lestrange.
Stunning Spells shot across the room: <PER>Harry</PER> smashed <PER>Harry</PER>'s way through the door ahead, flung <PER>Ron</PER> unceremoniously from <PER>Harry</PER>, and ducked back to help <PER>Neville</PER> in with <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“ Colloportus\” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side.
“Luna — <PER>Neville</PER> — help me!” The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as them went: <PER>Harry</PER> crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s haste to reach the next door.
Luna and <PER>Neville</PER> were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall — then, as <PER>Harry</PER> reached the very top of the room, <PER>Harry</PER> heard Luna cry, “Collo — aaaaaaaaargh <PER>Harry</PER> turned in time to see her flying through the air.
<PER>Harry</PER> dodged her and sprinted back up the room; <PER>Harry</PER> was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy — “Hey!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward <PER>Harry</PER>, giggling.
“Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn’t that weird, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “<PER>Ron</PER>, get out of the way, get down — ” But “<PER>Ron</PER> had already pointed his wand at the tank.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> and each of the Death Eaters to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish.
For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared toward <PER>Ron</PER>, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film — “Ha ha ha, <PER>Harry</PER>, look at it — ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come and touch it, bet it’s weird — ” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what would happen if <PER>Ron</PER> touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but <PER>Harry</PER> was sure it would not be anything good.
<PER>Harry</PER> darted forward but <PER>Ron</PER> had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, look what’s happen — no — no, I don’t like it — no, stop — stop — ” But the thin ribbons were spinning around <PER>Ron</PER>’s chest now.
<PER>Harry</PER> tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against <PER>Harry</PER> like an octopus’s body.
“Diffindol” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around <PER>Ron</PER> before his eyes, but they would not break.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, it’ll suffocate <PER>Harry</PER>!” screamed <PER>Ginny</PER>, immobilized by <PER>Ginny</PER>'s broken ankle on the floor — then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater’s wands and hit her squarely in the face.
“ STUBEFYl” shouted <PER>Neville</PER>, wheeling around and waving <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand at the oncoming Death Eaters.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> that left craters in the wall behind <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange sprinted right at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Inwardly praying that <PER>Neville</PER> would stay with <PER>Ron</PER> — find some way of releasing him — <PER>Neville</PER> ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish — <PER>Neville</PER> was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of <PER>Neville</PER>'s body, — <PER>Neville</PER> landed flat on — <PER>Neville</PER>'s back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on the stone archway dais.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet though <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs were trembling so badly they barely supported <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER> was scrambling down the stone benches toward them, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand held fast in <PER>Neville</PER>'s trembling hand.
“<PER>Neville</PER> — no — go back to <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “STUBEFYl” <PER>Neville</PER> shouted again, pointing <PER>Neville</PER>'s wand at each Death Eater in turn, “STUBEFYl.
She looked transported, alive with excitement as She glanced at <PER>Harry</PER>, then back at <PER>Neville</PER>.
the prophecy was hot with the heat from <PER>Harry</PER>'s clutching hand as <PER>Harry</PER> held it out.
The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as them jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Neville</PER> crawling along.
<PER>Harry</PER> dodged another jet of red light and flung <PER>Harry</PER> flat on the ground to reach <PER>Neville</PER>.
“And <PER>Ron</PER>?” “I dink he’s all right — he was still fighding the brain when I left — ” The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where <PER>Neville</PER>’s hand had been seconds before.
Both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized <PER>Harry</PER> around the neck and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> upright, so that <PER>Harry</PER>'s toes were barely touching the floor.
Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix — nobody seemed to realize that <PER>Harry</PER> was dying <PER>Harry</PER> turned his wand backward toward The man’s side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man’s free hand was groping toward the hand in which <PER>Harry</PER> was grasping the prophecy — <PER>Neville</PER> had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a spell, — <PER>Neville</PER> had jabbed <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater’s mask.
The man relinquished <PER>Harry</PER> at once with a howl of pain and <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around to face him and gasped, The Death Eater keeled over backward and The Death Eater's mask slipped off.
“Thanks!” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Neville</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> aside as Sirius and <PER>Harry</PER>'s Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs.
Then <PER>Harry</PER>’s foot made contact with something round and hard and <PER>Harry</PER>’s slipped — for a moment <PER>Harry</PER>’s thought <PER>Harry</PER>’s had dropped the prophecy, then saw Moody’s magic eye spinning away across the floor.
Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>: Dolohov, Dolohov's long pale face twisted with glee.
“Now, Potter — ” Potter — made the same slashing movement with Potter —'s wand that he had used on <PER>Hermione</PER> just as <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “Protego\” <PER>Harry</PER> felt something streak across <PER>Harry</PER>'s face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and him fell over <PER>Neville</PER>’s jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.
The prophecy had again flown to the tips of <PER>Harry</PER>’s fingers but <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to cling to it.
Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand tips — Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, take the prophecy, grab <PER>Neville</PER>, and run!” Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across <PER>Harry</PER>'s field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head as <PER>Harry</PER> launched <PER>Harry</PER> toward <PER>Neville</PER> — “Can you stand?” he bellowed in <PER>Neville</PER>’s ear, as <PER>Neville</PER>’s legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably.
“Put your arm round my neck — ” <PER>Neville</PER> did so — <PER>Harry</PER> heaved — <PER>Neville</PER>’s legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them.
Both fell backward, <PER>Neville</PER>’s legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle’s, <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed.
“The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!” snarled Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice in Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s's ear, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the tip of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand pressing hard between <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs.
“No — get — off — me <PER>Neville</PER> — catch it!” <PER>Harry</PER> flung the prophecy across the floor, <PER>Neville</PER> spun <PER>Neville</PER> around on <PER>Neville</PER>'s back and scooped the ball to his chest.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> pointed the wand instead at <PER>Neville</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> jabbed his own wand back over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and yelled, “Impedimental” <PER>Malfoy</PER> was blasted off his back.
As <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled up again <PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> aimed <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> again, but before <PER>Malfoy</PER> could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, round up the others and GO!” <PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Neville</PER> by the shoulder of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone steps.
<PER>Harry</PER> heaved again with all the strength <PER>Harry</PER> possessed and they climbed another step A spell hit the stone bench at <PER>Harry</PER>’s heel.
It crumbled away and <PER>Harry</PER> fell back to the step below: <PER>Neville</PER> sank to the ground, <PER>Neville</PER>'s legs still jerking and thrashing, and thrust the prophecy into <PER>Neville</PER>'s pocket.
“Come on!” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, hauling at <PER>Neville</PER>’s robes.
“Just try and push with your legs — ” <PER>Harry</PER> gave another stupendous heave and <PER>Neville</PER>’s robes tore all along the left seam — the small spun-glass ball dropped from <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and before either of them could catch it, one of <PER>Neville</PER>’s floundering feet kicked it.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could <PER>Harry</PER> hear.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’b sorry!” cried <PER>Neville</PER>, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder, “I’b so sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>, I didn’d bean do — ■” “It doesn’t matter!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“Just try and stand, let’s get out of — ” “ Dubbledorel” said <PER>Neville</PER>, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“What?” <PER>Harry</PER> turned to look where <PER>Neville</PER> was staring.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s body — they were saved.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sped down the steps past <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>, who had no more thought of leaving.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was there.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s spell pulled <PER>Dumbledore</PER> back as easily and effortlessly as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had hooked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with an invisible line — Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Sirius duck Bellatrix’s jet of red light: <PER>Harry</PER> was laughing at her.
<PER>Harry</PER> released <PER>Neville</PER>, though <PER>Harry</PER> was unaware of doing so.
<PER>Harry</PER> was jumping down the steps again, pulling out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to the dais too.
His body curved in a graceful arc as His sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch And <PER>Harry</PER> saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather’s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard Bellatrix Lestrange’s triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing — Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, <PER>Harry</PER> would reappear from the other side any second But — Sirius did not reappear.
“SIRIUS!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “SIRIUS!” <PER>Harry</PER> had reached the floor, <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath coming in searing gasps.
Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, <PER>Harry</PER>, would pull him back out again But as him reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin grabbed <PER>Harry</PER> around the chest, holding <PER>Harry</PER> back.
“There’s nothing you can do, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “Get him, save him, him’s only just gone through!” “It’s too late, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “We can still reach him — ” <PER>Harry</PER> struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go “There’s nothing you can do, <PER>Harry</PER> nothing <PER>Harry</PER>’s gone.” “<PER>Harry</PER> hasn’t gone!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not believe it, <PER>Harry</PER> would not believe it; still <PER>Harry</PER> fought Lupin with every bit of strength <PER>Harry</PER> had: Lupin did not understand, people hid behind that curtain, Lupin had heard people whispering the first time Lupin had entered the room — Sirius was hiding, simply lurking out of sight — “SIRIUS!” SIRIUS!
To <PER>Harry</PER> it was meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered except that Lupin stop pretending that Sirius, who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain, was not going to emerge at any moment, shaking back <PER>Harry</PER>'s dark hair and eager to reenter the battle — Lupin dragged <PER>Harry</PER> away from the dais, <PER>Harry</PER> still staring at the archway, angry at Sirius now for keeping <PER>Harry</PER> waiting — But some part of <PER>Harry</PER> realized, even as <PER>Harry</PER> fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept <PER>Harry</PER> waiting before Sirius had risked everything, always, to see <PER>Harry</PER>, to help <PER>Harry</PER> If Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when <PER>Harry</PER> was yelling for <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s life depended on it, the only possible explanation was that he could not come back That he really was <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room, seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Neville</PER> had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where <PER>Harry</PER> stood.
<PER>Harry</PER> was no longer struggling against Lupin, who maintained a precautionary grip on <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm nevertheless.
“<PER>Harry</PER> I’b really sorry” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
her was halfway up the steps now — “<PER>Harry</PER> — no!” cried Lupin, but <PER>Harry</PER> had already ripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm from Lupin’s slackened grip.
he leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past <PER>Ginny</PER>, who said, “<PER>Harry</PER> — what — ?” past <PER>Ron</PER>, who giggled feebly, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was still unconscious.
The doors slid shut and <PER>Harry</PER> was rising <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER>'s way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around.
“Aaaaaah did you love him, little baby Potter?” Hatred rose in <PER>Harry</PER> such as <PER>Harry</PER> had never known before.
“I was and am <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s most loyal servant, I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete — ” “Stupefy\” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Give me the prophecy — roll it out toward me now — and I may spare your life!” “Well, you’re going to have to kill me, because it’s gone!” <PER>Harry</PER> roared — and as <PER>Harry</PER> shouted it, pain seared across <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
<PER>Harry</PER> scar was on fire again, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with <PER>Harry</PER>'s own rage.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
Tall, thin, and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupiled eyes staring Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> who stood frozen, quite unable to move.
“So you smashed my prophecy?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> softly, staring at <PER>Harry</PER> with those pitiless red eyes.
“No, Bella, <PER>Harry</PER> is not lying I see the truth looking at me from within <PER>Harry</PER>'s worthless mind Months of preparation, months of effort and my Death Eaters have let <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thwart me again” “Master, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus Black!” sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s feet as he paced slowly nearer.
But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
And then he breathed, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> looked behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart pounding.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> raised <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand and sent another jet of green light at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak; next second he had reappeared behind <PER>Voldemort</PER> and waved his wand toward the remnants of the fountain; the other statues sprang to life too.
The headless statue thrust <PER>Harry</PER> backward, away from the fight, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> advanced on <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the golden centaur cantered around them both.
The force of the spell that emanated from it was such that <PER>Harry</PER>, though shielded by <PER>Harry</PER>'s stone guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed, and this time <PER>Voldemort</PER> was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect a shining silver shield.
The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gonglike note reverberated from it, an oddly chilling sound “You do not seek to kill me, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” called <PER>Voldemort</PER>, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield.
“Above such brutality, are you?” “We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said calmly, continuing to walk toward <PER>Voldemort</PER> as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s stroll up the hall.
“Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit — ” “There is nothing worse than death, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” snarled <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“You are quite wrong,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still closing in upon <PER>Voldemort</PER> and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt scared to see <PER>Harry</PER> walking along, undefended, shieldless.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to cry out a warning, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s headless guard kept shunting him backward toward the wall, blocking him's every attempt to get out from behind it.
This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had drawn back <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip.
For a moment, it seemed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold upon <PER>Voldemort</PER> at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike — There was a burst of flame in midair above <PER>Dumbledore</PER> just as <PER>Voldemort</PER> reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> from <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand and the snake had struck — Fawkes swooped down in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, opened — Fawkes's beak wide, and swallowed the jet of green light whole.
At the same moment, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> brandished <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand in one, long, fluid movement — the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; the water in the pool rose up and covered <PER>Voldemort</PER> like a cocoon of molten glass — For a few seconds <PER>Voldemort</PER> was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass — Then <PER>Voldemort</PER> was gone, and the water fell with a crash back into the water pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor.
Sure it was over, sure <PER>Voldemort</PER> had decided to flee, <PER>Harry</PER> made to run out from behind <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s statue guard, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> bellowed, “Stay where you are, <PER>Harry</PER>!” For the first time, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sounded frightened.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s knew <PER>Harry</PER>’s was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance — <PER>Harry</PER>’s was gone from The hall, <PER>Harry</PER>’s was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that <PER>Harry</PER> did not know where <PER>Harry</PER>'s body ended and the creature’s began.
They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape — And when the creature spoke, the creature used <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth, so that in <PER>Harry</PER>'s agony <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s jaw move “ Kill me now, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>” Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, <PER>Harry</PER> felt the creature use <PER>Harry</PER> again “If death is nothing, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, kill the boy” Let the pain stop, thought <PER>Harry</PER>.
Let <PER>Harry</PER> kill us End it, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> Death is nothing compared to this And I’ll see Sirius again And as <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart filled with emotion, the creature’s coils loosened, the pain was gone, <PER>Harry</PER> was lying facedown on the floor, <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses gone, shivering as though <PER>Harry</PER> lay upon ice, not wood And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than there should have been: <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, saw his glasses lying at the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding <PER>Harry</PER>, but which now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking so violently <PER>Harry</PER> could not hold <PER>Harry</PER>'s head up properly.
As <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pulled him back to him's feet, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin leading a stunned-looking <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge forward.
“I saw <PER>Harry</PER>, Mister Fudge, I swear, it was <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed a woman and Disapparated!” “I know, Williamson, I know, I saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> too!” gibbered Fudge, who was wearing pajamas under <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> had just run miles.
“You — here — I — I — ” He looked wildly around at the Aurors He had brought with He, and it could not have been clearer that He was in half a mind to cry, “Seize He!” “<PER>Cornelius</PER>, I am ready to fight your men — and win again!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in a thunderous voice.
“We can discuss that after I have sent <PER>Harry</PER> back to Hogwarts,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” Fudge spun around and stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had been guarding him during <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s duel.
“Why — what’s all this about?” “I shall explain everything,” repeated <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “when <PER>Harry</PER> is back at school.” <PER>Harry</PER> walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard’s head lay on the floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at it and muttered, “Portus.” The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more.
“Now see here, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said Fudge, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> picked up The head and walked back to <PER>Harry</PER> carrying it.
“You will give the order to remove Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER> from Hogwarts,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I — you — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s back on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Take this Portkey, <PER>Harry</PER>.” He held out the golden head of the statue, and <PER>Harry</PER> placed He's hand upon it, past caring what He did next or where He went.
“One two three ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s navel.
The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the Atrium, Fudge, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had all disappeared, and his was flying forward in a whirlwind of color and sound <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet hit solid ground again; <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees buckled a little and the golden wizard’s head fell with a resounding clunk to the floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw that <PER>Harry</PER> had arrived in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
If he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had not been stupid enough to fall for <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s trick, if <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not been so convinced that what <PER>Voldemort</PER> had seen in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s dream was real, if <PER>Voldemort</PER> had only opened <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s mind to the possibility that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, as <PER>Hermione</PER> had said, banking on <PER>Harry</PER>’s love of playing the hero It was unbearable, <PER>Harry</PER> would not think about it, <PER>Harry</PER> could not stand it There was a terrible hollow inside <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to feel or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent space, <PER>Harry</PER> could not stand it — A picture behind <PER>Harry</PER> gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and a cool voice said, “Ah <PER>Harry</PER> Potter ” Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms as <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> with shrewd, narrow eyes.
Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not tell <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I hope this means,” said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk, “that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will soon be back with us?” <PER>Harry</PER> turned.
<PER>Harry</PER> tugged again on the doorknob behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, but it remained immovable.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said comfortably.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not stand this, <PER>Harry</PER> could not stand being <PER>Harry</PER> anymore <PER>Harry</PER> had never felt more trapped inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s own head and body, never wished so intensely that <PER>Harry</PER> could be somebody — anybody — else The empty fireplace burst into emerald-green flame, making <PER>Harry</PER> leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not look at <PER>Harry</PER> at first, but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s robes, the tiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom <PER>Harry</PER> placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usually stood.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, finally turning away from the baby bird, “you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night’s events.” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to say “Good,” but no sound came out.
It seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was reminding <PER>Harry</PER> of the amount of damage <PER>Harry</PER> had caused by <PER>Harry</PER>'s actions tonight, and although <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was for once looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> directly, and though <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s expression was kindly rather than accusatory, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could not bear to meet <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes.
“Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. Mungo’s, but it seems that Madam Pomfrey will make a full recovery.” <PER>Harry</PER> contented <PER>Harry</PER> with nodding at the carpet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure that all the portraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke, wondering where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had been and why there had been injuries.
“I know how you are feeling, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> very quietly.
“No, you don’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice was suddenly loud and strong.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew nothing about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feelings.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and stared determinedly out of the opposite window.
Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy black dog, so <PER>Harry</PER> could watch <PER>Harry</PER> play <PER>Harry</PER> had probably come to see whether <PER>Harry</PER> was as good as James had been <PER>Harry</PER> had never asked <PER>Harry</PER> “There is no shame in what you are feeling, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s voice.
“On the contrary the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt the white-hot anger lick <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling <PER>Harry</PER> with the desire to hurt <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for <PER>Harry</PER>'s calmness and <PER>Harry</PER>'s empty words.
“My greatest strength, is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice shaking as <PER>Harry</PER> stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it.
He had not flinched or made a single move to stop <PER>Harry</PER> demolishing <PER>Harry</PER>'s office.
“You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.” “I — DONT!” <PER>Harry</PER> screamed, so loudly that <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat might tear, and for a second <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to rush at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and break him too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned back to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I daresay I have too many.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked around <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk and sat down behind it, watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Let me out,” <PER>Harry</PER> said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s desk.
“Am I to understand,” said Phineas Nigellus slowly from <PER>Harry</PER>’s left, “that my great-great-grandson — the last of the Blacks — is dead?” “Yes, Phineas,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head in time to see Phineas marching out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place.
he would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, calling for Sirius through the house “<PER>Harry</PER>, I owe you an explanation,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“And this ability of yours — to detect <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s presence, even when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused — has become more and more pronounced since <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own body and his full powers.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not bother to nod.
“More recently,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “I became concerned that <PER>Voldemort</PER> might realize that this connection between you exists.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> corrected him quietly.
“I believed it could not be long before <PER>Voldemort</PER> attempted to force <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to give <PER>Voldemort</PER> more incentives to do so.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s aim in possessing you, as <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s demonstrated tonight, would not have been my destruction.
<PER>Harry</PER> was letting the words wash over <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, and now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside <PER>Harry</PER> that was the loss of Sirius, none of it mattered “Sirius told me that you felt <PER>Voldemort</PER> awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley’s attack.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s explanation.
Phineas Nigellus had still not returned “Professor <PER>Snape</PER> discovered,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> resumed, “that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months.
“I didn’t practice, I didn’t bother, I could’ve stopped myself having those dreams, <PER>Hermione</PER> kept telling me to do it, if I had he’d never have been able to show me where to go, and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t — ” Something was erupting inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head: a need to justify himself, to explain — “I tried to check if he’d really taken Sirius, I went to <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and he said — Sirius wasn’t there, he said he’d gone!” Kreacher lied,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
“You are not <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s master, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could lie to you without even needing to punish <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> hasn’t been out of Grimmauld Place for years.” “Kreacher seized “Kreacher's opportunity shortly before Christmas,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to ‘get out.’ He took Sirius at He's word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house.
“You see, when you gave Professor <PER>Snape</PER> that cryptic warning, Professor <PER>Snape</PER> realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries.
“So when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night ” “The <PER>Malfoy</PER>s — undoubtedly on <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s instructions — had told <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER> must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured.
“But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I — persuaded He — to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.” “And,” whispered <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands curled in cold fists on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, “and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept telling us to be nice to him — ” “She was quite right, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Kreacher ’s a lying — foul — Kreacher deserved — ” Kreacher is what Kreacher has been made by wizards, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
he was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered “What about <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> spat.
“<PER>Snape</PER> — <PER>Snape</PER> g-goaded Sirius about staying in the house — he made out Sirius was a coward — ” “Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!” <PER>Harry</PER> snarled.
“<PER>Harry</PER> threw me out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s office!” “I am aware of it,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> heavily.
“I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to <PER>Voldemort</PER> while in my presence — ” “<PER>Snape</PER> made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him — ” <PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Ron</PER>’s thoughts on the subject and plunged on.
“How do you know him wasn’t trying to soften me up for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, make it easier for <PER>Voldemort</PER> to get inside my — ” “I trust Severus <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> simply.
“It’s okay for <PER>Snape</PER> to hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher?” “Sirius did not hate Kreacher,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“People don’t like being locked up!” <PER>Harry</PER> said furiously, rounding on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You did it to me all last summer — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> closed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes and buried <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long-fingered hands.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER>, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, did not soften <PER>Harry</PER>.
On the contrary, <PER>Harry</PER> felt even angrier that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was showing signs of weakness.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no business being weak when <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to rage and storm at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> lowered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hands and surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> through <PER>Harry</PER>'s half-moon glasses.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at <PER>Harry</PER> and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER>, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended.
“She doesn’t give a damn — ” “But She took you,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cut across <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Don’t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, why <PER>Voldemort</PER> had tried to kill you when you were a baby?” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
“Ought I to have told you then?” <PER>Harry</PER> stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was racing again.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office was bathed in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments <PER>Harry</PER> had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind <PER>Harry</PER>, the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in the baby Fawkes's nest of ashes.
He bent down, slid back a catch, and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER>'s father tormenting <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own temple.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat back down behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk and watched <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment.
“The one with the power to vanquish <PER>Voldemort</PER> approaches Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies and <PER>Voldemort</PER> will mark him as him's equal, but him will have power <PER>Voldemort</PER> knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives The one with the power to vanquish <PER>Voldemort</PER> will be born as the seventh month dies” The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished.
Neither <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> nor any of the portraits made a sound.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> said very quietly, for Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought.
“It did that mean What did that mean?” “It meant,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago.
“It means — me?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> surveyed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a moment through <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s glasses.
“It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that <PER>Voldemort</PER> could only have tried to kill you because <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.” “Then — it might not be me?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I am afraid,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, “that there is no doubt that it is you.” “But you said — <PER>Neville</PER> was born at the end of July too — and his mum and dad — ” “You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself would ‘mark him as him's equal.’ And so he did, <PER>Harry</PER>.
If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again, <PER>Harry</PER> asked, without caring much about the answer, “The end of the prophecy it was something about ‘neither can live’ ” “ ‘ while the other survives,’ ” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“So,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him, “so does that mean that that one of us has got to kill the other one in the end?” “Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Sirius seemed a million miles away already, even if a part of <PER>Harry</PER> still believed that if <PER>Harry</PER> had only pulled back that veil, <PER>Harry</PER> would have found Sirius looking back at <PER>Harry</PER>, greeting <PER>Harry</PER>, perhaps, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s laugh like a bark “I feel I owe you another explanation, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hesitantly.
Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived — “There you are, <PER>Harry</PER>, I knew they’d drag you into it somehow,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking over the top of the paper at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting on the end of <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed and they were both listening to <PER>Hermione</PER> read the front page of the Sunday Prophet.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, whose ankle had been mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bed; <PER>Neville</PER>, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was reading the magazine upside down and apparently not taking in a word <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying.
“Not such a show-off maniac anymore, eh?” He helped He to a handful of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frogs from the immense pile on He's bedside cabinet, threw a few to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>, and ripped off the wrapper of He's own with He's teeth.
“Yes, they’re very complimentary about you now, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now scanning down the article.
The curse Dolohov had used on <PER>Hermione</PER>, though less effective than The curse Dolohov would have been had Dolohov been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in Madam Pomfrey’s words, “quite enough damage to be going on with.” <PER>Hermione</PER> was having to take ten different types of potion every day and although <PER>Hermione</PER> was improving greatly, was already bored with the hospital wing.
“ ‘You-Know- Who’s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four, What the Ministry Should Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, page nine ’ Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, folding up the newspaper and throwing the newspaper aside, “it’s certainly given them lots to write about.
“He got a very good price for it too, so we’re going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a Crumple- Horned Snorkack.” <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to struggle with <PER>Hermione</PER> for a moment, then said, “That sounds lovely.” <PER>Ginny</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and looked away quickly, grinning.
“So anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sitting up a little straighter and wincing again, “what’s going on in school?” “Well, Flitwick’s got rid of Fred and George’s swamp,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“They sent me all these, you know,” he told <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather disapproving and asked, “So has all the trouble stopped now <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s back?” “Yes,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, “everything’s settled right back down again.” “I s’pose Filch is happy, is he?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, propping a <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog card featuring <PER>Dumbledore</PER> against his water jug.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had strode alone into the forest to rescue <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s from the centaurs.
How <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had done it — how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had emerged from the trees supporting Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> without so much as a scratch on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — nobody knew, and <PER>Umbridge</PER> was certainly not telling.
“Sulking, more like,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> “Yeah, <PER>Ginny</PER> shows signs of life if you do this,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises.
“No no ” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, sinking back into <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s pillows, “no, I must have been dreaming” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.
“Speaking of centaurs,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, when <PER>Hermione</PER> had recovered a little, “who’s Divination teacher now?
“Bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wishes Bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could’ve got rid of Trelawney for good,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, now munching on Bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fourteenth Frog.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not told <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, or anyone else what the prophecy had contained.
<PER>Neville</PER> had told them it had smashed while <PER>Harry</PER> was pulling <PER>Harry</PER> up the steps in the Death Room, and <PER>Harry</PER> had not yet corrected this impression.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not ready to see their expressions when <PER>Harry</PER> told their that <PER>Harry</PER> must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way “It is a pity it broke,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly, shaking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
“Still, at least <PER>Voldemort</PER> never found out what was in it either — where are you going?” he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as <PER>Harry</PER> stood up.
“Er — <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Wish we could come ” “Say hello to he for we!” called <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> proceeded down the ward.
“And ask he what’s happening about about his little friend!” <PER>Harry</PER> gave a wave of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to show <PER>Harry</PER> had heard and understood as <PER>Harry</PER> left the dormitory.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of windows as <PER>Harry</PER> went.
<PER>Harry</PER> was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to be with people or not.
Whenever <PER>Harry</PER> was in company <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to get away, and whenever <PER>Harry</PER> was alone <PER>Harry</PER> wanted company.
He thought He might really go and visit <PER>Hagrid</PER>, though; He had not talked to He properly since He had returned <PER>Harry</PER> had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that <PER>Harry</PER> knew led down to the Slytherin common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped dead; so did <PER>Malfoy</PER> and the others.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was checking for signs of teachers.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> looked back at <PER>Harry</PER> and said in a low voice, “You’re dead, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyebrows.
“Funny,” he said, “you’d think I’d have stopped walking around” <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked angrier than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen him.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pale, pointed face contorted with rage.
“Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now — ” <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hand flew toward his wand, but <PER>Harry</PER> was too quick for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had drawn <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand before <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s fingers had even entered the pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Potter!” The voice rang across the entrance hall; <PER>Snape</PER> had emerged from the staircase leading down to <PER>Snape</PER>'s office, and at the sight of <PER>Snape</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything <PER>Harry</PER> felt toward <PER>Malfoy</PER> Whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER> would never forgive <PER>Snape</PER> never “What are you doing, Potter?” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly as ever, as <PER>Snape</PER> strode over to the four of them.
“I’m trying to decide what curse to use on <PER>Malfoy</PER>, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely.
<PER>Snape</PER> stared at <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>!” said <PER>Snape</PER>, striding forward.
“Out of St. Mungo’s, I see!” “Yes, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, shrugging off her traveling cloak, “I’m quite as good as new.
“Well, Potter, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> continued briskly.
<PER>Harry</PER> thrust <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago, but <PER>Harry</PER> had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it that way.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought at first when <PER>Harry</PER> knocked on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin door that <PER>Harry</PER> was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled Fang over with the enthusiasm of Fang's welcome.
“All righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>!” he said, beaming, when <PER>Harry</PER> approached the fence.
“You — er — feelin’ all righ’, are yeh?” <PER>Harry</PER> knew from the look of concern on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s face that he was not referring to <PER>Harry</PER>’s physical well- being.
“I’m fine,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly, because <PER>Harry</PER> could not bear to discuss the thing that <PER>Harry</PER> knew was in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s mind.
“Up in a cave, like Sirius did when he — ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at <PER>Harry</PER>, and took a long draft of juice.
<PER>Harry</PER> was starting to wish <PER>Harry</PER> was alone again, and with the idea of hastening <PER>Harry</PER>'s departure <PER>Harry</PER> took several large gulps of <PER>Harry</PER>'s dandelion juice, half emptying <PER>Harry</PER>'s glass.
“Ev’ryone knows you’ve bin tellin’ the truth now, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> softly and unexpectedly.
“Look ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> leaned toward him across the table, “I knew Sirius longer ’n you did He died in battle, an’ tha’s the way He’d’ve wanted ter go — ” “He didn’t want to go at all!” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
“But still, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was never one ter sit around at home an’ let other people do the fightin’.
“I’ve got to go and visit <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the hospital wing,” he said mechanically.
“Oh all righ then, <PER>Harry</PER> Take care of yerself then, an’ drop back in if yeh’ve got a mo” “Yeah right ” <PER>Harry</PER> crossed to the door as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could and pulled it open.
<PER>Harry</PER> was out in the sunshine again before <PER>Hagrid</PER> had finished saying goodbye and walked away across the lawn.
Once again, people called out to <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> passed.
He closed He's eyes for a few moments, wishing they would all vanish, that He could open He's eyes and find He alone in the grounds A few days ago, before He's exams had finished and He had seen the vision <PER>Voldemort</PER> had planted in He's mind, He would have given almost anything for the Wizarding world to know that He had been telling the truth, for them to believe that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was back and know that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was neither a liar nor mad.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term.
<PER>Hermione</PER> showed signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but <PER>Ron</PER> tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to talk about <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather yet; his wishes varied with his mood.
It seemed that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> met Peeves on the way, who seized Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s last chance to do as Fred had instructed and chased Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s gleefully from the premises, whacking Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk.
Indeed, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> sank back into Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> could not run cheering after <PER>Umbridge</PER> herself, because Peeves had borrowed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s walking stick.
“Come on, I’m starving” “I won’t be long Look, you go ahead” But when the dormitory door closed behind <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> made no effort to speed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s packing.
<PER>Harry</PER> was worried that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would make some reference to <PER>Harry</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>'s speech.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure to mention <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s return; <PER>Harry</PER> had talked to them about it last year, after all <PER>Harry</PER> pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk to make way for folded ones and, as <PER>Harry</PER> did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent down, pulled it out from underneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s trainers, and examined it.
<PER>Harry</PER> sank down onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and unwrapped the package.
<PER>Harry</PER> held it up to <PER>Harry</PER>'s face and saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s own reflection looking back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that <PER>Harry</PER> was going to see Sirius, talk to <PER>Harry</PER> again Disappointment was burning in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up and began throwing <PER>Harry</PER>'s things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror — But then an idea struck <PER>Harry</PER> A better idea than a mirror A much bigger, more important idea How had <PER>Harry</PER> never thought of it before — why had <PER>Harry</PER> never asked?
<PER>Harry</PER> was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as <PER>Harry</PER> ran and barely noticing.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurtled across the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after <PER>Harry</PER>, “The feast is about to start, you know, you’re cutting The feast very fine!” But <PER>Harry</PER> had no intention of going to The feast How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn’t need one, yet now <PER>Harry</PER> ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead.
“Can’t it wait until after the feast?” “No — Nick — please,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I really need to talk to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I can’t pretend I haven’t been expecting it.” <PER>Harry</PER> was holding the door open for <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> drifted through the wall instead.
“Expecting what?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, as <PER>Harry</PER> closed the door.
“Only only wizards.” “Oh,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> almost laughed with relief.
“Anyway — it doesn’t matter — Sirius won’t care if it’s unusual, he’ll come back, I know he will!” And so strong was his belief that <PER>Harry</PER> actually turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to check the door, sure, for a split second, that <PER>Harry</PER> was going to see Sirius, pearly white and transparent but beaming, walking through it toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt almost as though <PER>Harry</PER> had lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather all over again in losing the hope that <PER>Harry</PER> might be able to see or speak to <PER>Harry</PER> once more.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle, wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> would ever feel cheerful again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had turned the corner toward the Fat Lady’s corridor when <PER>Harry</PER> saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall.
Luna believed so many extraordinary things yet <PER>Harry</PER> had been sure <PER>Harry</PER> had heard voices behind the veil too “Are you sure you don’t want me to help you look for your stuff?” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“No, I think I’ll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up It always does in the end Well, have a nice holiday, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Yeah yeah, you too.” She walked away from <PER>Harry</PER>, and as <PER>Harry</PER> watched Shis go, <PER>Harry</PER> found that the terrible weight in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach seemed to have lessened slightly.
Firstly, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle, who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses, attempted to ambush <PER>Harry</PER> halfway down the train as <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way back from the toilet.
By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes <PER>Harry</PER> had taught them, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as <PER>Harry</PER>, Ernie, and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze.
“I must say, I’m looking forward to seeing <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s mother’s face when he gets off the train,” said Ernie with some satisfaction, as he watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> squirm above him.
“He’s loads betterlooking now Anyway, <PER>Harry</PER>, the food trolley’s just stopped if you want anything” <PER>Harry</PER> thanked the others and accompanied <PER>Ron</PER> back to their compartment, where he bought a large pile of Cauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Pasties.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was reading the Daily Prophet again, <PER>Ginny</PER> was doing a quiz in The Quibbler, and <PER>Neville</PER> was stroking his Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while <PER>Hermione</PER> read out snippets from the Prophet It was now full of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> walking past their house that very morning “It hasn’t really started yet,” sighed <PER>Hermione</PER> gloomily, folding up the newspaper again.
“But it won’t be long now” “Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, nodding toward the glass window onto the corridor.
<PER>Cho</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER>’s eyes met for a moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pawns chased off its square by <PER>Ron</PER>’s knight.
Wanting to impress <PER>Cho</PER> seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with <PER>Cho</PER>.
So much of what <PER>Cho</PER> had wanted before Sirius’s death felt that way these days The week that had elapsed since <PER>Cho</PER> had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer: It stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in It, and the one without.
“Who’s she with now anyway?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, but it was <PER>Ginny</PER> who answered.
As the train slowed down in the approach to King’s Cross, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had never wanted to leave it less.
<PER>Harry</PER> even wondered fleetingly what would happen if <PER>Harry</PER> simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take <PER>Harry</PER> back to Hogwarts.
When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, <PER>Harry</PER> lifted down Hedwig’s cage and prepared to drag <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk from the train as usual.
When the ticket inspector signaled to him, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, <PER>Harry</PER> found a surprise awaiting <PER>Harry</PER> on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet <PER>Harry</PER> whom <PER>Harry</PER> had not expected at all.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>!” called Molly, hurrying forward and hugging Molly's children tightly.
“Oh, and <PER>Harry</PER> dear — how are you?” “Fine,” lied <PER>Harry</PER>, as she pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into a tight embrace.
“Business is booming and we thought we’d treat we.” “Hello, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lupin, as Molly let go of <PER>Harry</PER> and turned to greet <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see <PER>Harry</PER>’s reception committee.
“Ah, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said Arthur, turning from <PER>Hermione</PER>’s parents, whom he had been greeting enthusiastically, and who were taking it in turns to hug <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> disengaged <PER>Hermione</PER> gently from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mother to join the group.
“You might remember me, my name’s Arthur Weasley.” As Arthur had singlehandedly demolished most of the Dursleys’ living room two years previously, <PER>Harry</PER> would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes,” said Arthur, “even if you won’t let <PER>Harry</PER> use the fellytone — ” “ Telephone ,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Keep in touch.” “<PER>Harry</PER>, we’ll have you away from there as soon as we can,” Molly whispered, hugging “<PER>Harry</PER> again.
“We’ll see you soon, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER> anxiously, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
“Really soon, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> earnestly.
“I’ve been writing to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> twice a day for the past fortnight, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’t budge.
<PER>Snape</PER> threw off <PER>Snape</PER>'s cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at <PER>Snape</PER>'s white and trembling hands clasped in <PER>Snape</PER>'s lap.
“So, what can I do for you?” <PER>Snape</PER> asked, settling <PER>Snape</PER> in the armchair opposite the two sisters.
“And then he will return to his bedroom.” Wormtail winced as though <PER>Snape</PER> had thrown something at <PER>Snape</PER>.
“This can be easily arranged: I shall speak to <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “I can speak to him myself if I want to!” “Of course you can,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, sneering.
<PER>Snape</PER> refilled <PER>Snape</PER>'s glasses.
<PER>Snape</PER> set <PER>Snape</PER>'s glass down upon the table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Bellatrix’s glowering face.
<PER>Snape</PER> picked up <PER>Snape</PER>'s drink again, sipped it, and continued, “You ask where I was when <PER>Voldemort</PER> fell.
“You ask why I did not attempt to find <PER>Voldemort</PER> when <PER>Voldemort</PER> vanished.
“While I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s pet!” “Not quite,” said <PER>Snape</PER> calmly.
“What useful information have we had from you?” “My information has been conveyed directly to <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“No, you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, <PER>Snape</PER>?” “My orders were to remain behind,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Perhaps you disagree with <PER>Voldemort</PER>, perhaps you think that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix?
“He lately, we I am asking you, <PER>Snape</PER>!” “If I had murdered <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, <PER>Voldemort</PER> could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible — ” “You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she jeered.
“And you overlook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s greatest weakness: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has to believe the best of people.
“Even <PER>Snape</PER> says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!” But Even <PER>Snape</PER> had gotten to Even <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk.
“To punish Lucius?” “If <PER>Malfoy</PER> succeeds,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, still looking away from her, “he will be honored above all others.” “But he won’t succeed!” sobbed Narcissa.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> does not mean him to succeed, <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants him to be killed trying!” When <PER>Snape</PER> said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed.
Standing up, she staggered to <PER>Snape</PER> and seized the front of <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes.
<PER>Snape</PER> stooped, seized <PER>Snape</PER>'s by the arms, lifted <PER>Snape</PER>'s up, and steered <PER>Snape</PER>'s back onto the sofa.
<PER>Snape</PER> then poured <PER>Snape</PER>'s more wine and forced the glass into <PER>Snape</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Snape</PER> lowered <PER>Snape</PER> so that <PER>Snape</PER> was kneeling opposite Narcissa.
“Will you, Severus, watch over my son, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, as he attempts to fulfill <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wishes?” “I will,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“And, should it prove necessary if it seems <PER>Malfoy</PER> will fail ” whispered Narcissa (<PER>Snape</PER>’s hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), “will you carry out the deed that <PER>Voldemort</PER> has ordered <PER>Malfoy</PER> to perform?” There was a moment’s silence.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter had been sitting in a chair beside <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's bedroom window for the best part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one side of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's face pressed against the cold windowpane, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's glasses askew and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's mouth wide open.
Said Mistress Augusta Longbottom, “My grandson, <PER>Neville</PER> — a good friend of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and — But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong — his reply to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s letter might have gone astray; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could be prevented from collecting <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s letter might turn out not to be from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> at all, but a trick or joke or trap.
The only gesture <PER>Harry</PER> had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut <PER>Harry</PER>'s snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.
Hastily straightening <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and unsticking <PER>Harry</PER>'s cheek from the glass, <PER>Harry</PER> pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped up as though <PER>Harry</PER> had received an electric shock, knocked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair, and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk.
<PER>Harry</PER> had completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might be coming.
Feeling both panicky and close to laughter, <PER>Harry</PER> clambered over the trunk and wrenched open <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, “Good evening.
“Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, <PER>Harry</PER> did not warn you that I was coming,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pleasantly.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not doubt that speech would return to <PER>Harry</PER>, and soon — the vein pulsing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle’s temple was reaching danger point — but something about <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to have robbed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> temporarily of breath.
“Ah, good evening <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER> through <PER>Harry</PER>'s half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression.
“Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction.
“We have corresponded, of course.” <PER>Harry</PER> thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that <PER>Harry</PER> had once sent Aunt Petunia's an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term.
“And this must be your son, <PER>Dudley</PER>?” <PER>Dudley</PER> had that moment peered round the living room door.
“Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> simply, “I shall.” He drew his wand so rapidly that <PER>Harry</PER> barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursley s so that they collapsed upon it in a heap.
As he replaced his wand in his pocket, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s flesh had been burned away.
“Sir — what happened to your — ?” “Later, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, raising his glass to <PER>Harry</PER>, who caught hold of his own and sipped.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not suppress a suspicion that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was rather enjoying <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, turning toward him, “a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> both turned to look at him.
“And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius’s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.” Without realizing what he was doing, <PER>Harry</PER> sprang to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet; the telescope and trainers in <PER>Harry</PER>'s lap rolled across the floor.
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> politely, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand again.
“But it would have been better manners to drink it, you know.” It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but Uncle Vernon merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER> and said nothing, keeping Uncle Vernon's small piggy eyes on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s wand.
“You see,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, turning back to <PER>Harry</PER> and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, “if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited — ” He flicked his wand for a fifth time.
<PER>Dudley</PER> drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though his thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, “What the hell is that?” “Kreacher,” finished <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won’t, won’t, won’t — ” “As you can see, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> loudly, over Kreacher’s continued croaks of “won’t, won’t, won’t,” “Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.” “I don’t care,” said <PER>Harry</PER> again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf.
“I don’t want <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t — ” “You would prefer <PER>Harry</PER> to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange?
<PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth still working furiously, He's eyes bulging.
After a few seconds of frantic gulping, <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and feet, giving <PER>Harry</PER> over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.
“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily, hurrying to pick up <PER>Harry</PER>'s fallen telescope and trainers.
It took <PER>Harry</PER> a little over ten minutes to track down everything <PER>Harry</PER> needed; at last <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to extract <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk shut on <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron.
Then, heaving <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig’s cage in the other, <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way back downstairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> was disappointed to discover that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was not waiting in the hall, which meant that <PER>Harry</PER> had to return to the living room.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was humming quietly, apparently quite at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare look at the Dursleys as <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Professor — I’m ready now.” “Good,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“As you will no doubt be aware, <PER>Harry</PER> comes of age in a year’s time — ” “No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s arrival.
“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that <PER>Harry</PER> has powerful protection while <PER>Harry</PER> can still call this house ‘home.’ However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed he houseroom.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER> time for us to be off,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> at last, standing up and straightening his long black cloak.
“Bye,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily to the Dursleys, and followed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who paused beside <PER>Harry</PER>’s trunk, upon which Hedwig’s cage was perched.
“We do not want to be encumbered by these just now,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, pulling out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand again.
When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> waved <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> then waved <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand again, and the front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.
“And now, <PER>Harry</PER>, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.” Despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would indeed come to fetch him, <PER>Harry</PER> felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet Drive together.
The memory of them's last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened <PER>Harry</PER>’s sense of embarrassment; <PER>Harry</PER> had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done <PER>Harry</PER>'s best to smash several of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s most prized possessions.
“This will do, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.
“Well, here we go.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s arm twist away from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and redoubled <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then — he gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes.
“The sensation does take some getting used to.” “I’m fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly.
“So tell me, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Your scar has it been hurting at all?” <PER>Harry</PER> raised a hand unconsciously to <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark.
“Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> has finally realized the dangerous access to Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> again.
“Professor?” “<PER>Harry</PER>?” “Er — where exactly are we?” “This, <PER>Harry</PER>, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.” “And what are we doing here?” “Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Thinking of dementors, <PER>Harry</PER> cast a look over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not consider it rude to call on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had more pressing questions to ask.
“For future reference, <PER>Harry</PER>, it is raspberry although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.” “Er right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the front gate, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stopped dead and <PER>Harry</PER> walked into <PER>Harry</PER>.
he opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, <PER>Harry</PER> at <PER>Harry</PER>'s heels, then pushed the front door very slowly, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand raised and at the ready.
“Lumos.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s wand tip ignited, casting <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s wand tip light up a narrow hallway.
Holding his illuminated wand aloft, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked into the sitting room with <PER>Harry</PER> right behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s small intake of breath made <PER>Dumbledore</PER> look around.
“Yes, something horrible has happened here.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed, gazing around, half-scared of what <PER>Harry</PER> might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.
“Ohol” “This,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, moving forward to make the introduction, “is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER> and directed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> toward a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated, which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp.
<PER>Harry</PER> took the seat with the distinct impression that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, for some reason, wanted to keep <PER>Harry</PER> as visible as possible.
“Here — ” He gave a drink to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at <PER>Harry</PER>, and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence.
If <PER>Harry</PER> had not known who lived there, <PER>Harry</PER> would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady.
“Reactions not what they were, I see.” “You’re quite right,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> serenely, shaking back <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck prickle unpleasantly.
Slughorn’s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw a tiny frown momentarily crease <PER>Harry</PER>'s wide forehead.
Slughorn ’s watery eyes slid over <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar, this time taking in the rest of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Oh, now,” he went on quickly, seeing the expression on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and wagging a stubby finger at <PER>Harry</PER>, “don’t go holding that against me!
“Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and none of the teachers has ever been killed — well, unless you count <PER>Quirrell</PER>, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” he had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which he ignored.
“I reckon the staff are safer than most people while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s headmaster; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s supposed to be the only one <PER>Voldemort</PER> ever feared, isn’t he?” <PER>Harry</PER> went on.
“Well, yes, it is true that <PER>Voldemort</PER> has never sought a fight with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” he muttered grudgingly.
He twiddled He's fat thumbs and fidgeted as He watched <PER>Dumbledore</PER> fasten his traveling cloak, and <PER>Harry</PER> zip up <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s jacket.
As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn ’s voice floated after them, “111 want a pay rise, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> chuckled.
“Well done, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Horace,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, relieving <PER>Harry</PER> of the responsibility to say any of this, “likes his comfort.
When the pressure disappeared and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> able to breathe again, <PER>Harry</PER> was standing in a country lane beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of <PER>Harry</PER>'s second favorite building in the world: the Burrow.
“If you don’t mind, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, as they passed through the gate, “I’d like a few words with you before we part.
A little puzzled, <PER>Harry</PER> followed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> illuminated the tip of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> could tell that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> understood, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might even suspect that until <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s letter arrived, <PER>Harry</PER> had spent nearly all <PER>Harry</PER>'s time at the Dursleys’ lying on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, refusing meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors.
“It’s just hard,” <PER>Harry</PER> said finally, in a low voice, “to realize <PER>Harry</PER> won’t write to <PER>Harry</PER> again.” <PER>Harry</PER> eyes burned suddenly and <PER>Harry</PER> blinked.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to <PER>Harry</PER>, almost like a parent, had been one of the best things about discovering He's godfather and now the post owls would never bring He that comfort again.
“Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mister <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley and Miss <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
He continued, “On a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.” “Private — with you?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, surprised out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s preoccupied silence.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited hopefully, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not elaborate, so <PER>Harry</PER> asked something else that had been bothering <PER>Harry</PER> slightly.
“If I’m having lessons with you, I won’t have to do Occlumency lessons with <PER>Snape</PER>, will I?” “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> — and no, you will not.” “Good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in relief, “because they were a — ” He stopped, careful not to say what He really thought.
“Well, that means I won’t see much of Professor <PER>Snape</PER> from now on,” Professor <PER>Snape</PER> said, “because Professor <PER>Snape</PER> won’t let me carry on Potions unless I get ‘Outstanding’ in my O.W.L., which I know I haven’t.” “Don’t count your owls before they are delivered,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gravely.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knocked three times and <PER>Harry</PER> saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window.
“Declare yourself!” “It is I, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, bringing <PER>Harry</PER>.” The door opened at once.
“Wotcher, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Hi, Tonks.” <PER>Harry</PER> thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was something forced in shis smile.
“Thanks for the tea and sympathy, Molly.” “Please don’t leave on my account,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> courteously, “I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.” “No, no, I need to get going,” said Tonks, not meeting <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyes.
“ ’Night — ” “Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and Mad-Eye are coming — ?” “No, really, Molly thanks anyway Good night, everyone.” Tonks hurried past <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air.
“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Molly closed the door on the empty yard and then steered <PER>Harry</PER> by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine <PER>Harry</PER>'s appearance.
“You’re like <PER>Ron</PER>,” she sighed, looking <PER>Harry</PER> up and down.
“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.” As <PER>Harry</PER> sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and settled there, purring.
“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth so full of hot soup that <PER>Harry</PER> could not speak.
“<PER>Harry</PER> was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I think.
<PER>Harry</PER> swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat blistering.
Hedwig hooted happily at <PER>Harry</PER> from Hedwig's perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; <PER>Harry</PER> knew she had been waiting to see <PER>Harry</PER> before going hunting.
Seconds later, or so it seemed to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open.
Sitting bolt upright, <PER>Harry</PER> heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling sunlight seemed to poke <PER>Harry</PER> hard in both eyes.
Shielding them with one hand, <PER>Harry</PER> groped hopelessly for <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses with the other.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s hand found <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and <PER>Harry</PER> shoved them on, though the light was so bright <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly see anyway.
“All right?” “Never been better,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, rubbing the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and slumping back onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillows.
“We thought — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> flashed a warning look at <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> changed tack at top speed.
“Something wrong, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER>?
“He can’t be worse than <PER>Umbridge</PER>, can He?” “I know someone who’s worse than <PER>Umbridge</PER>,” said a voice from the doorway.
“Hi, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “What’s up with you?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked.
“It’s her,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, plonking herself down on <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed.
“It’s the way she talks to me — you’d think I was about three!” “I know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, dropping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>’s so full of <PER>Hermione</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> was astonished to hear <PER>Hermione</PER> talking about Molly like this and could not blame <PER>Ron</PER> for saying angrily, “Can’t you two lay off Molly's for five seconds?” “Oh, that’s right, defend Molly,” snapped <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Starting to feel that he was missing something, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Who are you — ?” But <PER>Harry</PER>'s question was answered before <PER>Harry</PER> could finish it.
The bedroom door flew open again, and <PER>Harry</PER> instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chin so hard that <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> slid off the bed onto the floor.
“There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself!” “Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees and then swooping to kiss <PER>Harry</PER> on each cheek: <PER>Harry</PER> felt the places where her mouth had touched <PER>Harry</PER> burn.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help noticing how Molly, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were all determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze.
“Well, you do,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but if her jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then ” “It’s pathetic,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> furiously, striding away from <PER>Ron</PER> as far as <PER>Hermione</PER> could go and turning to face him with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arms folded once <PER>Hermione</PER> had reached the wall.
“You don’t really want her around forever?” <PER>Ginny</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> incredulously.
When he merely shrugged, <PER>Ginny</PER> said, “Well, Mum’s going to put a stop to it if <PER>Ginny</PER> can, I bet you anything.” “How’s <PER>Ginny</PER> going to manage that?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t spoken, “I was just saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur — ” “I’d much rather have Tonks in the family,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> thinks it was <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fault he died!” “How does <PER>Hermione</PER> work that one out?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, in spite of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, <PER>Hermione</PER> was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t <PER>Hermione</PER>?
“I know Lupin’s tried to talk <PER>Hermione</PER>'s round, but <PER>Hermione</PER>’s still really down.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” <PER>Ginny</PER> whispered, “come downstairs and help me with the lunch.” “I’m talking to this lot!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, outraged.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was peering into Fred and George’s boxes, though every now and then <PER>Hermione</PER> cast sideways looks at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who was now helping himself to <PER>Harry</PER>’s toast, was still gazing dreamily at the door.
“Dunno,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but if Fred and George’ve left it here, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful.” “Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But he knows your dad was right all along now about <PER>Voldemort</PER> being back — ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I heard him telling your mum, <PER>Ron</PER>.” “Sounds like the sort of mental thing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would say,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> choked on his bit of toast, and <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped.
“<PER>Harry</PER> told me last night in your broom shed.” “Blimey private lessons with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking impressed.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw him and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchange looks.
<PER>Harry</PER> laid down <PER>Harry</PER>'s knife and fork, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart beating rather fast considering that all <PER>Harry</PER> was doing was sitting in bed.
He fixed He's eyes on He's fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into He's lap, and said, “I don’t know exactly why He’s going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.” Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke.
<PER>Harry</PER> continued, still speaking to <PER>Harry</PER>'s fork, “You know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry.” “Nobody knows what it said, though,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly.
“It got smashed.” “Although the Prophet says — ” began <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Shh!” “The Prophet’s got it right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking up at them both with a great effort: <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed frightened and <PER>Ron</PER> amazed.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>!” shouted <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash.
“Don’t worry,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was plainly trying not to laugh, “Mumll fix that, she’s good at healing minor injuries — ” “Oh well, never mind that now!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, oh, <PER>Harry</PER> ” <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on the edge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed again.
“We wondered, after We got back from the Ministry Obviously, We didn’t want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> said about the prophecy, how it was about you and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, well, We thought it might be something like this.
he knew that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though him were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than him could ever tell them. "
“Hang on,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as another part of last night’s conversation came back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It just won’t budge,” Molly was saying anxiously, standing over <PER>Hermione</PER> with Molly's wand in Molly's hand and a copy of The Healer’s Helpmate open at “Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This has always worked before, I just can’t understand it.” “It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a funny joke, making sure it can’t come off,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> “But it’s got to come off!” squeaked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers together.
“And when you’ve got your eleven ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L.s ” “Don’t, don’t, don’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, flapping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands hysterically.
“I know I’ve failed everything!” “What happens if we fail?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked the room at large, but it was again <PER>Hermione</PER> who answered.
“We discuss We options with We Head of House, I asked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> at the end of last term.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach squirmed.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had eaten less breakfast.
“They’re definitely owls,” said <PER>Ron</PER> hoarsely, jumping up to join <PER>Hermione</PER> at the window.
“Oh no oh no oh no ” She gripped both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> tightly around the elbows.
To <PER>Harry</PER>'s left, <PER>Ron</PER> was trying to detach his own results; to his right, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hands were shaking so much <PER>Hermione</PER>’s was making <PER>Hermione</PER>’s's whole owl tremble.

<PER>Hermione</PER> had <PER>Hermione</PER>'s back to He and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head bent, but <PER>Ron</PER> was looking delighted.
“Here — swap — ” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced down <PER>Ron</PER>’s grades: There were no “Outstandings” there.
“Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, punching <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder.
“Seven O.W.L.s, that’s more than Fred and George got together!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Ginny</PER> tentatively, for <PER>Hermione</PER> still hadn’t turned around.
“You’re actually disappointed, aren’t you?” <PER>Hermione</PER> shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head, but <PER>Harry</PER> laughed.
“Mum, are there any more sausages?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked back down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s results.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent most of <PER>Harry</PER>'s days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys’ orchard (he and <PER>Hermione</PER> against <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> was dreadful and <PER>Ginny</PER> good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Molly put in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“The man who ran — ” “ — the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” <PER>Harry</PER> interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s included a surprise: <PER>Harry</PER> had been made Quidditch Captain.
“And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!” <PER>Ron</PER> turned to stare incredulously at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into Molly's arms and stormed out of the room.
Bill, who would be staying at home with Fleur (much to <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> mimed vomiting into <PER>Ginny</PER>'s cereal behind Fleur.
<PER>Harry</PER> choked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s cornflakes, and <PER>Ron</PER> thumped <PER>Harry</PER> on the back.
He, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat.
“Ah, good, he’s here!” <PER>Harry</PER> imitated Arthur and peered through the window; <PER>Harry</PER> imitated Arthur's heart leapt.
There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black- bearded form of Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” he boomed, sweeping <PER>Harry</PER> into a bone- crushing hug the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had stepped out of the car.
“Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh should see him, <PER>Harry</PER>, him’s so happy ter be back in the open air — ” “Glad he’s pleased,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning as he massaged his ribs.
He looked up hopefully as they entered, but before He could speak, <PER>Hagrid</PER> said importantly, “Jus’ passin’ through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know.” Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood.
“I think we’d better do Madam Malkin’s first, <PER>Hermione</PER> wants new dress robes, and <PER>Ron</PER>’s showing much too much ankle in <PER>Ron</PER>’s's school robes, and you must need new ones too, <PER>Ron</PER>’s, you’ve grown so much — come on, everyone — ” “Molly, it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin’s,” said Arthur.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, do you think — ?” “Don’ fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid.
Molly did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with Molly's husband and <PER>Ginny</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> set off for Madam Malkin’s.
“I’ll stand guard outside, all right?” So <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the little shop together.
It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> than <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue. "
He strode to the mirror and examined He; it was a few moments before He noticed <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> reflected over He's shoulder.
“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“And I don’t want wands drawn in my shop either!” she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had shown shis <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both standing there with their wands out and pointing at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Put those away,” she said coldly to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Really, you shouldn’t accuse — dangerous thing to say — wands away, please!” But <PER>Harry</PER> did not lower <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“I see that being <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s favorite has given you a false sense of security, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
“I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.” <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand higher.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” moaned <PER>Hermione</PER>, grabbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm and attempting to push it down by <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
She bent toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was still glaring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’re right, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said Narcissa, with a contemptuous glance at <PER>Hermione</PER>, “now I know the kind of scum that shops here.
She was distracted all through the fitting of <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Harry</PER>’s new robes, tried to sell <PER>Hermione</PER> wizard’s dress robes instead of witch’s, and when She finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them.
“Did you see the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, unconcerned.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard a weak sort of moan beside <PER>Harry</PER> and looked around to see Molly gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster.
“No They won’t!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who, like <PER>Harry</PER>, was laughing.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during the twins's last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf.
A space cleared in the crowd, and <PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box that read: REUSABLE “ ‘Patented Daydream Charms ’ ” <PER>Hermione</PER> had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’ll give you a tour.” <PER>Harry</PER> left <PER>Hermione</PER> dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred bracingly toward the back of the shop, where <PER>Harry</PER> saw a stand of card and rope tricks.
“Take whatever you like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if people ask.” George swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Fred led <PER>Harry</PER> back into the main part of the shop to find <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> both hung back, looking wary.
“But we’re not selling them to we sister,” he added, becoming suddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about five boys on the go from what we’ve — ” “Whatever you’ve heard from <PER>Ron</PER> is a big fat lie,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf.
“But you’re moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren’t you?” <PER>Ginny</PER> turned to look at him, <PER>Ginny</PER>'s hands on <PER>Ginny</PER>'s hips.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was hurrying up the street alone.
As <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> passed Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> glanced over <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s shoulder.
Seconds later, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> said nothing; <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking too hard.
Narcissa <PER>Malfoy</PER> would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; <PER>Malfoy</PER> must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches.
<PER>Harry</PER>, knowing and loathing <PER>Malfoy</PER>, was sure the reason could not be innocent.
“Get under here, quick,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak out of Invisibility Cloak's bag.
“Oh — I don’t know, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking uncertainly toward Molly.
She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, <PER>Malfoy</PER> had disappeared just as successfully as they had.
“He was going in that direction,” murmured <PER>Harry</PER> as quietly as possible, so that the humming <PER>Hagrid</PER> would not hear them.
There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which <PER>Harry</PER> had once hidden to avoid <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s father.
“Extendable Ears, look!” “Fantastic!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ron</PER> unraveled the long, fleshcolored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> shuffled sideways to try and keep He in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.
himself passed so close to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again.
“<PER>Harry</PER> wants something mended and <PER>Harry</PER> wants to reserve something in there.
<PER>Hermione</PER> checked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again.
<PER>Ron</PER> hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Hello, horrible morning, isn’t it?” <PER>Hermione</PER> said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast <PER>Hermione</PER>'s a suspicious look.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the nasty feeling <PER>Harry</PER> knew exactly what <PER>Hermione</PER> was up to.
Apparently <PER>Hermione</PER> felt <PER>Hermione</PER> had been rumbled too because <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly threw caution to the winds.
“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just now, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I want to get he a birthday present, but if he’s already reserved anything, I obviously don’t want to get he the same thing, so um ” It was a pretty lame story in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too.
“Get out!” <PER>Hermione</PER> did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s heels.
“Ah well,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, throwing the cloak back over <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> bickered all the way back to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Molly and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had clearly noticed their absence.
Once in the shop, <PER>Harry</PER> whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Molly’s accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked properly.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s behavior in Knockturn Alley.
What disturbed <PER>Harry</PER> most was the satisfied look on <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face as <PER>Harry</PER> had left the shop.
To his slight annoyance, however, neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed quite as curious about <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s activities as his was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.
“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> a little impatiently.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George’s room with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s new copy of Advanced Rune Translation.
“Remember that shriveled-up arm <PER>Malfoy</PER> had?” “But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep that one safe’?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> for the umpteenth time.
“That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of the broken objects, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> wants both.” “You reckon?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.
When neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> answered, he said, “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s father’s in Azkaban.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in an anxious voice.
“I think he just wanted to get out of there, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
On the landing <PER>Harry</PER> bumped into <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.
The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find The Ministry cars waiting, trunks packed; <PER>Hermione</PER>’s cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; <PER>Ron</PER>’s owl, Pigwidgeon; and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.
<PER>Ron</PER> hurried forward, looking hopeful, but <PER>Ginny</PER> stuck out her foot and <PER>Ron</PER> fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur’s feet.
“<PER>Harry</PER> had better go first, with — ” She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s upper arm, and attempted to steer <PER>Harry</PER> toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.
“I can walk, thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER> irritably, jerking <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm out of the Auror’s grip.
Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, <PER>Harry</PER> motioned to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment.
“We can’t, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking apologetic.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and I’ve got to go to the prefects’ carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.” “Oh yeah, I forgot,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if <PER>Harry</PER> was to tell anyone, Mister Weasley was the right person; firstly, because <PER>Harry</PER> worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly, because <PER>Harry</PER> thought that there was not too much risk of Arthur exploding with anger.
“When we were in Diagon Alley,” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but Mister Weasley forestalled <PER>Harry</PER> with a grimace.
“Am I about to discover where you, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George’s shop?” “How did you — ?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, please.
After a moment he said, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I doubt whether <PER>Voldemort</PER> would allow a sixteen-year-old — ” “Does anyone really know what <PER>Voldemort</PER> would or wouldn’t do?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
“You see, when Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> was arrested, we raided Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s house.
“Now, dear, you’re coming to us for Christmas, it’s all fixed with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, so we’ll see you quite soon,” said Molly through the window, as <PER>Harry</PER> slammed the door shut behind <PER>Harry</PER> and the train began to move.
<PER>Harry</PER> supposed <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were cloistered in the prefects’ carriage, but <PER>Ginny</PER> was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends.
“Fancy trying to find a compartment?” “I can’t, <PER>Harry</PER>, I said I’d meet Dean,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> brightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, shis long red hair dancing behind she; <PER>Harry</PER> had become so used to shis presence over the summer that <PER>Harry</PER> had almost forgotten that <PER>Ginny</PER> did not hang around with him, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> while at school.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and looked around: <PER>Harry</PER> was surrounded by mesmerized girls.
“<PER>Neville</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> in relief, turning to see a round- faced boy struggling toward a round- faced boy.
“Hello, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Because us’re with you!” “They’re staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> hoisted <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk into the luggage rack.
“No point now we’ve got rid of <PER>Umbridge</PER>, is there?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting down.
<PER>Neville</PER> bumped <PER>Neville</PER>'s head against the seat as he emerged from under it.
with only an “Acceptable,” <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> without really listening.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s childhood had been blighted by <PER>Voldemort</PER> just as much as <PER>Harry</PER>’s had, but <PER>Neville</PER> had no idea how close <PER>Neville</PER> had come to having <PER>Harry</PER>’s destiny.
The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had chosen to believe that <PER>Harry</PER> was the one meant.
Had <PER>Voldemort</PER> chosen <PER>Neville</PER>, it would be <PER>Neville</PER> sitting opposite <PER>Harry</PER> bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of The prophecy.
Would <PER>Neville</PER>’s mother have died to save <PER>Neville</PER>’s, as Lily had died for <PER>Harry</PER>?
An empty seat where <PER>Neville</PER> now sat and a scarless <PER>Harry</PER> who would have been kissed good- bye by his own mother, not <PER>Ron</PER>’s?
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> caught each other’s eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.
It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the compartment at last.
“Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving,” said <PER>Ron</PER> longingly, slumping into the seat beside <PER>Harry</PER> and rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
Didn’t this look as though <PER>Malfoy</PER> had more important things on <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s mind than bullying younger students?
“I’m supposed to deliver these to <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom and <PER>Harry</PER> P-Potter,” she faltered, as shis eyes met <PER>Harry</PER>’s and she turned scarlet.
Perplexed, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> took the scroll addressed to each of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.
“What is it?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded, as <PER>Harry</PER> unrolled his.
<PER>Harry</PER>, I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C. Sincerely, Professor H. E. F. Slug horn “Who’s Professor Slughorn?” asked <PER>Neville</PER>, looking perplexedly at Who’s Professor Slughorn?”'s own invitation.
<PER>Harry</PER> stowed it regretfully back in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since <PER>Harry</PER> had last walked down the train.
The exception was <PER>Cho</PER> Chang, who darted into her compartment when her saw <PER>Harry</PER> coming.
As <PER>Harry</PER> passed the window, <PER>Harry</PER> saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys <PER>Harry</PER> did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Now, do you know everyone?” Slughorn asked <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course — Blaise Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did <PER>Harry</PER> or <PER>Neville</PER>: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.
<PER>Ginny</PER> grimaced at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> from behind Slughorn’s back.
“I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,” Slughorn told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>, now passing around a basket of rolls.
It was <PER>Neville</PER>’s turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents, well- known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies.
At the end of <PER>Neville</PER>’s interview, <PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on <PER>Neville</PER>, yet to see whether <PER>Harry</PER> had any of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ flair.
“<PER>Neville</PER> and I were both there too, and all this ‘<PER>Cho</PER>sen One’ rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual.” “You were both there too, were you?” said Slughorn with great interest, looking from <PER>Ginny</PER> to <PER>Neville</PER>, but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile.
“I remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) — ” He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but <PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with <PER>Harry</PER>, and that <PER>Harry</PER> had not been convinced by <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Well, off you go, off you go!” As he pushed past <PER>Harry</PER> into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that <PER>Harry</PER> returned with interest.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> followed Zabini back along the train.
“How come you ended up in there, <PER>Ginny</PER>?” “He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
If <PER>Harry</PER> could only enter, unseen, behind <PER>Harry</PER>, what might <PER>Harry</PER> not see or hear?
True, there was little of the journey left — Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows — but nobody else seemed prepared to take <PER>Harry</PER>’s suspicions seriously, so it was down to <PER>Harry</PER> to prove them.
“I’ll see you two later,” said <PER>Harry</PER> under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, pulling out <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over <PER>Harry</PER>.
Zabini was already sliding Zabini shut when <PER>Harry</PER> hastily stuck out <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot to prevent Zabini closing.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized the door and pushed the door open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, <PER>Harry</PER> darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted <PER>Harry</PER> up into the luggage rack.
It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of <PER>Harry</PER> remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s forehead, smirking as Pansy did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in Pansy's place.
“Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at ‘the <PER>Cho</PER>sen One,’ ” sneered <PER>Malfoy</PER>, “but that Weasley girl!
<PER>Malfoy</PER> sank back across <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s lap and allowed <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s to resume the stroking of his hair.
What would <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> say about this?
“We’d better get We robes on.” <PER>Harry</PER> was so busy staring at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> did not notice Goyle reaching up for <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk; as <PER>Harry</PER> swung it down, it hit <PER>Harry</PER> hard on the side of the head.
<PER>Harry</PER> let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not afraid of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> would take his things out onto the platform for <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> was stuck where <PER>Harry</PER> was until the compartment had quite emptied.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> were alone in the compartment.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> then bent down over <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s trunk and opened <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s trunk again.
<PER>Harry</PER> peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart pumping a little faster.
“Petrificus Totalusl” Without warning, <PER>Malfoy</PER> pointed <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was instantly paralyzed.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose break; blood spurted everywhere.
“See you around, Potter or not.” And taking care to tread on <PER>Harry</PER>’s fingers, <PER>Malfoy</PER> left the compartment.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose flow, hot and wet, over <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never hated <PER>Malfoy</PER> more than as <PER>Harry</PER> lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into <PER>Harry</PER>'s open mouth.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would think that himself had left the train without them.
A feeling of hopelessness spread through he as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage <PER>Malfoy</PER> was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on <PER>Harry</PER> to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.
The train lurched, causing <PER>Harry</PER> to roll over onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off he and a voice overhead said, “Wotcher, <PER>Harry</PER>.” There was a flash of red light and <PER>Harry</PER>’s body unfroze; he was able to push he into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised face with the back of his hand, and raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibility Cloak she had just pulled away.
“Who did it?” “<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
“I can fix your nose if you stand still.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not think much of this idea; <PER>Harry</PER> had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom <PER>Harry</PER> had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so <PER>Harry</PER> stayed stock-still and closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
As <PER>Harry</PER> swung the cloak back over <PER>Harry</PER>, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.
“Was that a Patronus?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, who had seen <PER>Dumbledore</PER> send messages like this.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at Tonks under <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak.
He reflected uncomfortably that <PER>Hermione</PER> would have suggested He say something consoling about Sirius to <PER>Hermione</PER>, that it hadn’t been <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fault at all, but He couldn’t bring He to do it.
<PER>Harry</PER> was cold, <PER>Harry</PER> was hungry, and <PER>Harry</PER> was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind.
But when <PER>Harry</PER> put out a hand to push open the gates, <PER>Harry</PER> found them chained shut.
“Alohomora\” <PER>Harry</PER> said confidently, pointing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> bewitched them <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around.
<PER>Harry</PER> was so pleased to see it <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> could even endure Filch’s wheezy criticisms of <PER>Harry</PER>'s tardiness and rants about how <PER>Harry</PER>'s timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews.
It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak so that <PER>Harry</PER> could be seen, that <PER>Harry</PER> recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.” “I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but <PER>Snape</PER> cut across <PER>Harry</PER>.
“The new one looks weak.” As <PER>Snape</PER> swung the lantern about, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonks’s face.
“Good night,” <PER>Harry</PER> called to shis over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, as <PER>Harry</PER> began the walk up to the school with <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Thanks for everything.” “See you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Snape</PER> did not speak for a minute or so.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that <PER>Snape</PER> could not feel them burning <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> had loathed <PER>Snape</PER> from their first encounter, but <PER>Snape</PER> had placed <PER>Snape</PER> forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of <PER>Harry</PER>’s forgiveness by <PER>Snape</PER>'s attitude toward Sirius.
Whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER> had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that <PER>Snape</PER> ’s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting <PER>Voldemort</PER> had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died.
<PER>Harry</PER> clung to this notion, because it enabled <PER>Harry</PER> to blame <PER>Snape</PER>, which felt satisfying, and also because <PER>Harry</PER> knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness.
“And with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect.” Still <PER>Harry</PER> remained silent, though Still <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest might explode.
Still <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Snape</PER> had come to fetch <PER>Harry</PER> for this, for the few minutes when Still <PER>Harry</PER> could needle and torment <PER>Harry</PER> without anyone else listening.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Harry</PER> could slip <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining Invisibility Cloak's seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed.
As though <PER>Harry</PER> had read <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, however, <PER>Snape</PER> said, “No cloak.
It was all a shimmering blur to <PER>Harry</PER>, however, who walked so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time people were standing up to get a good look at him, him had spotted <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, sped along the benches toward them, and forced his way in between them.
“Why, what’s wrong with it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grabbing a spoon and squinting at <PER>Harry</PER>'s distorted reflection.
“Come here <PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, said “Tergeol” and siphoned off the dried blood.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, feeling <PER>Harry</PER>'s now clean face.
He was very conscious that <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop.
“Not now, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in a darkly significant voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> hoped very much that they would all assume <PER>Harry</PER> had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor.
Of course, <PER>Malfoy</PER> would spread the story as far and wide as <PER>Harry</PER> could, but there was always a chance it wouldn’t reach too many Gryffindor ears.
“You missed the Sorting, anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ron</PER> dived for a large chocolate gateau.
“More of the same, really advising us all to unite in the face of our enemies, you know.” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> mentioned <PER>Voldemort</PER> at all?” “Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast, doesn’t he?
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> was only a few minutes late,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Look, he’s waving at you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at the staff table and grinned at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was indeed waving at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Head of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting.
<PER>Harry</PER> was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s other side; she rarely left shis tower room, and <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen shis at the start-of-term feast before.
Having always considered shis a bit of a fraud, <PER>Harry</PER> had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> to kill <PER>Harry</PER>’s parents and attack <PER>Harry</PER> himself.
The knowledge had made <PER>Harry</PER> even less eager to find <PER>Harry</PER> in her company, but thankfully, this year <PER>Harry</PER> would be dropping Divination.
Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in <PER>Harry</PER>'s direction; <PER>Harry</PER> hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s gaze to <PER>Harry</PER>'s treacle tart, <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides burning again.
What he would not give to fight <PER>Malfoy</PER> one-on-one “So what did Professor Slughorn want?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked.
“People were interrogating us about it on the train, weren’t they, <PER>Ron</PER>?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“All wanting to know if you really are ‘the <PER>Cho</PER>sen One’ — ” “There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts,” interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward <PER>Harry</PER> so that it wobbled dangerously on it ruff.
“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,” said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet at the staff table.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s right hand was as blackened and dead- looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch <PER>Harry</PER> from the Dursleys.
Whispers swept the room; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s purple-and-gold sleeve over his injury.
“Potions?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, turning to stare at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But you said — ” “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, meanwhile,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, raising <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s voice so that it carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.” “No!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, so loudly that many heads turned in <PER>Harry</PER>'s direction.
Hadn’t it been widely known for years that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not trust <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to do it?
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I thought he was!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, racking <PER>Harry</PER>'s brains to remember when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> this, but now that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> came to think of it, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was unable to recall <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ever telling <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what Slughorn would be teaching.
<PER>Snape</PER>, who was sitting on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s right, did not stand up at the mention of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s name; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> could detect a look of triumph on the features <PER>Harry</PER> loathed so much.
“<PER>Snape</PER> ’ll be gone by the end of the year.” “What do you mean?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that <PER>Snape</PER> had finally achieved his heart’s desire.
“Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength.” The silence seemed to tauten and strain as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was not looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but making <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the headmaster’s words unworthy of the headmaster's attention.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to <PER>Malfoy</PER> to allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw ahead of him.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had darted ahead to fulfill <PER>Hermione</PER>'s prefect’s duty of shepherding the first years, but <PER>Ron</PER> remained with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Listen to what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying before <PER>Harry</PER> found out I was there.
With what <PER>Harry</PER> considered pure pigheadedness, however, <PER>Ron</PER> was unimpressed.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was just showing off for Parkinson.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> uses that name,” said <PER>Harry</PER> stubbornly.
“Yeah, well, tha’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, innit?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> mysteriously.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Ron</PER> was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself.
“And you’re not either, are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head too.
“And <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “she’s not, is she?” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> met <PER>Hermione</PER> in the common room before breakfast next morning.
Hoping for some support for his theory, <PER>Harry</PER> lost no time in telling <PER>Hermione</PER> what <PER>Harry</PER> had overheard <PER>Malfoy</PER> saying on the Hogwarts Express.
“But <PER>Harry</PER> was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn’t <PER>Harry</PER>?” interjected <PER>Ron</PER> quickly, before <PER>Hermione</PER> could say anything.
The boy, who had been muttering something about <PER>Harry</PER> behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to <PER>Harry</PER>'s friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm.
“Today’s going to be a real doss, I reckon.” “Hold it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past <PER>Hermione</PER>'s with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand.
<PER>Ron</PER> waited for The scowling boy to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s grip.
“Excellent, I’ve always wanted one of these.” <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found <PER>Ron</PER>’s remark highly amusing.
While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> about their embarrassing conversation with <PER>Hagrid</PER> the previous evening.
They avoided <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s eye and returned <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's cheery wave only halfheartedly when <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s left the staff table ten minutes later.
<PER>Neville</PER> took a little longer to sort out; <PER>Neville</PER>'s round face was anxious as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked down Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s application and then consulted Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s O.W.L.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> peered at him through Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s square spectacles.
“It’s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she’s got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have — particularly after what happened at the Ministry.” <PER>Neville</PER> turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had never paid Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> a compliment before.
“Take Charms,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because her failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.” Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on <PER>Neville</PER>’s face, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> tapped a blank schedule with the tip of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to <PER>Neville</PER>.
“So, Potter, Potter ” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, consulting her notes as she turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Look,” said <PER>Ron</PER> delightedly, gazing at his schedule, “we’ve got a free period now and a free period after break and after lunch excellent.” They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that <PER>Harry</PER> had joined in <PER>Harry</PER>'s first year.
“We got so much homework for Runes,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said anxiously, when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> joined <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I bet <PER>Snape</PER> gives us loads.” The classroom door opened as she spoke, and <PER>Snape</PER> stepped into the corridor, <PER>Snape</PER>'s sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair.
<PER>Snape</PER> had imposed <PER>Snape</PER>'s personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight.
“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily dropped <PER>Hermione</PER>'s copy of Confronting the Faceless back into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag and stowed it under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s chair.
“You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.” You believe like you haven’t watched them all come and go, <PER>Snape</PER>, hoping you’d be next, thought <PER>Harry</PER> scathingly.
“Is it definite, is he using them?” “The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, “which means you would be well-advised to assume <PER>Snape</PER> might use them again.
<PER>Snape</PER> took <PER>Snape</PER>'s time looking around at everybody else, making sure <PER>Snape</PER> had no choice, before saying curtly, “Very well — Miss Granger?” “Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you’re about to perform,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “which gives you a split-second advantage.” “An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,” said <PER>Snape</PER> dismissively (over in the corner, <PER>Malfoy</PER> sniggered), “but correct in essentials.
<PER>Snape</PER> refused to drop <PER>Snape</PER>'s gaze, but glowered at <PER>Snape</PER> until <PER>Snape</PER> looked away.
Typically, ten minutes into the lesson <PER>Hermione</PER> managed to repel <PER>Neville</PER>’s muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly, but which <PER>Snape</PER> ignored.
<PER>Harry</PER> swept between them as them practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> struggling with the task.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who was supposed to be jinxing <PER>Harry</PER>, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save his from the temptation of muttering the incantation.
<PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.
“Here — let me show you — ” He turned He's wand on <PER>Harry</PER> so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “Protegol” <PER>Harry</PER> Shield Charm was so strong <PER>Snape</PER> was knocked off-balance and hit a desk.
The whole class had looked around and now watched as <PER>Snape</PER> righted <PER>Snape</PER>, scowling.
Behind <PER>Snape</PER>, however, <PER>Ron</PER>, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively.
“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, frowning at <PER>Ron</PER>.
Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, unrolling the parchment as he went.
“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had read the message over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder and was looking perplexed.
<PER>Hermione</PER> said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted to teach <PER>Harry</PER> advanced Defensive magic.
After break, <PER>Hermione</PER> went off to Arithmancy while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> returned to the common room, where they grudgingly started <PER>Snape</PER>’s homework.
This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when <PER>Hermione</PER> joined them for them's after-lunch free period (though <PER>Hermione</PER> considerably speeded up the process).
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” Ernie said portentously, holding out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand as <PER>Harry</PER> approached, “didn’t get a chance to speak in Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons.
This left <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> to share a table with Ernie.
They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents <PER>Harry</PER> had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded <PER>Harry</PER> simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> might have smelled at the Burrow.
<PER>Harry</PER> found that <PER>Harry</PER> was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion’s fumes seemed to be filling <PER>Harry</PER> up like drink.
A great contentment stole over <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> grinned across at <PER>Ron</PER>, who grinned back lazily.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, m’boy?” “I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s <PER>Ron</PER> — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see — ” “Ah, yes, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> did mention not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER> slightly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside his seat.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else’s; Slughorn pointed at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the second cauldron, but did not resent <PER>Hermione</PER> getting the credit for answering the question; <PER>Hermione</PER>, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> looked rather as <PER>Malfoy</PER> had done the time <PER>Hermione</PER> had punched <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the face.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER> with a radiant expression and whispered, “Did you really tell <PER>Harry</PER> I’m the best in the year?
“You are the best in the year — I’d’ve told <PER>Harry</PER> so if him’d asked me!” <PER>Hermione</PER> smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying.
Now all <PER>Harry</PER> could see of <PER>Malfoy</PER> was the back of his sleek blond head, because his was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> riffling feverishly through <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent <PER>Harry</PER>.
To <PER>Harry</PER>'s annoyance <PER>Harry</PER> saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions.
Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) <PER>Harry</PER> hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what <PER>Harry</PER> needed.
As <PER>Harry</PER> dashed back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> cutting up valerian roots as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
Having finished chopping his roots, <PER>Harry</PER> bent low over <PER>Harry</PER>'s book again.
“Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table.
“Yes,” said Slughorn, without looking at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, “I was sorry to hear <PER>Harry</PER> had died, although of course it wasn’t unexpected, dragon pox at <PER>Harry</PER>'s age.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent back over <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron, smirking.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had expected to be treated like <PER>Harry</PER> or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type <PER>Harry</PER> had learned to expect from <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> crushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s bean with the flat side of the dagger.
<PER>Harry</PER> stirred counterclockwise, held <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, and stirred once clockwise.
<PER>Harry</PER> shrugged and continued what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing.
As far as <PER>Harry</PER> could see, no one else’s potion had turned as pale as <PER>Harry</PER>.
At last he reached the table where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Ernie were sitting.
“Got lucky, I suppose,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Malfoy</PER> was within earshot.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent low to retrieve the book, and as <PER>Harry</PER> did so, <PER>Harry</PER> saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.
For the rest of the week’s Potions lessons <PER>Harry</PER> continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince’s instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about <PER>Harry</PER>’s abilities, saying that <PER>Harry</PER> had rarely taught anyone so talented.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> was delighted by this.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> had offered to share <PER>Harry</PER>'s book with both of them, <PER>Ron</PER> had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than <PER>Harry</PER> did, and could not keep asking <PER>Harry</PER> to read aloud or it might look suspicious.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what <PER>Hermione</PER> called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.
Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented <PER>Harry</PER> from reading the whole of <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion-Making, <PER>Harry</PER> had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making.
“Or herself,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> irritably, overhearing <PER>Harry</PER> pointing some of these out to <PER>Ron</PER> in the common room on Saturday evening.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Ooooh!” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking up at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> proceeded through deserted corridors, though <PER>Harry</PER> had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as herself shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as herself walked.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited until <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall.
“Acid Pops,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind the gargoyle slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which <PER>Harry</PER> stepped, so that <PER>Harry</PER> was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
“You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!” “Er,” began <PER>Harry</PER> awkwardly, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not look too stern.
“I have arranged with Professor <PER>Snape</PER> that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who had more pressing matters on his mind than S nape’s detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was planning to do with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> this evening.
The circular office looked just as The circular office always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle- legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching <PER>Harry</PER> with bright interest.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, in a businesslike voice.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> straightened up, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“This time, you enter the Pensieve with me and, even more unusually, with permission.” “Where are we going, sir?” “For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, pulling from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery- white substance.
“Shall — shall I, sir?” “No matter, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand at the bottle and the cork flew out.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged <PER>Harry</PER>'s face into the silvery substance.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet leave the office floor; <PER>Harry</PER> was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, <PER>Harry</PER> was blinking in dazzling sunlight.
Before <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes had adjusted, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> landed beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew this must be Ogden; <PER>Harry</PER> was the only person in sight, and <PER>Harry</PER> was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one- piece bathing costume.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> had time to do more than register <PER>Harry</PER>'s bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> followed.
As <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> passed the wooden sign, <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at its two arms.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> lengthened <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s stride, and <PER>Harry</PER> hurried to keep up.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as <PER>Harry</PER> had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance.
<PER>Harry</PER> soon discovered that <PER>Harry</PER> was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had left behind.
Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand.
As the dark shadows of the trees slid over <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake.
Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast <PER>Harry</PER> stood on the tails of <PER>Harry</PER>'s frock coat and stumbled.
his might have looked comical, but his did not; the effect was frightening, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before <PER>Harry</PER> spoke.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making <PER>Harry</PER> very clear in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion, particularly as <PER>Harry</PER> was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other.
“You understand <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sure, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
her looked a little cleaner than the two men, but <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen a more defeated-looking person.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that <PER>Harry</PER> was showing Ogden the ugly, black- stoned ring <PER>Harry</PER> was wearing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s middle finger, waving it before Ogden’s eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> indicated that they ought to follow and <PER>Harry</PER> obeyed, Merope ’s screams echoing in his ears.
“I think that will do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER> by the elbow and tugged.
“What happened to the girl in the cottage?” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand.
“Merope, or whatever her name was?” “Oh, she survived,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, reseating himself behind himself's desk and indicating that <PER>Harry</PER> should sit down too.
“I am glad to see you’re keeping up.” “That old man was — ?” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s grandfather, yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Yes, that was Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.” “And they ended up married?” <PER>Harry</PER> said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love.
“I think that will do for tonight, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> after a moment or two.
“Sir is it important to know all this about <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s past?” “Very important, I think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Sir, am I allowed to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> everything you’ve told me?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> considered <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a moment, then said, “Yes, I think Arthur and Miss Granger have proved Arthur and Miss Granger trustworthy.
“But isn’t it sir, isn’t it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> bowed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head.
“A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle’s, in fact.” “That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?” “Around that time, yes, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated.
<PER>Harry</PER> barely understood half of what Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said to them these days; even <PER>Hermione</PER> had had to ask <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to repeat instructions once or twice.
Incredibly, and to <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s increasing resentment, <PER>Harry</PER>’s best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.
<PER>Harry</PER> frequently looked over at <PER>Harry</PER>'s classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though them had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that them were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud.
One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had so far been unable to find time to go and visit <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“We’ve got to go and explain,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking up at <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at breakfast.
<PER>Harry</PER> too was missing <PER>Hagrid</PER>, although like <PER>Ron</PER> he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives.
“I dunno why the team’s this popular all of a sudden.” “Oh, come on, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, suddenly impatient.
<PER>Hermione</PER> spared him one look of disdain before turning back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot over the summer either,” <PER>Hermione</PER> finished, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had received no mail since the start of term; <PER>Harry</PER>'s only regular correspondent was now dead and although <PER>Harry</PER> had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, <PER>Harry</PER> had so far been disappointed.
“I’ll give Slughorn back the new one, Slughorn can’t complain, it cost nine Galleons.” <PER>Hermione</PER> pressed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lips together, looking angry and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s carrying that day’s copy of the Daily Prophet.
“Anyone we know dead?” asked <PER>Ron</PER> in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every time <PER>Hermione</PER> opened her paper.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> came to think of it, <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen <PER>Dumbledore</PER> since their private lesson a week ago.
“I think <PER>Harry</PER>’s left the school to do something with the Order,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low voice.
“Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.” “You didn’t try out last year, did you?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that <PER>Harry</PER> would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving.
The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls <PER>Harry</PER> had ever encountered, who, when <PER>Harry</PER> blew <PER>Harry</PER>'s whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another.
After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, <PER>Harry</PER> had found <PER>Harry</PER> three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot.
Pleased though he was with his choices, <PER>Harry</PER> had also shouted <PER>Harry</PER> hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced over at <PER>Ron</PER>, who had always had a problem with nerves; <PER>Harry</PER> had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: <PER>Ron</PER> was a delicate shade of green.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around, expecting to see <PER>Hermione</PER>, but it was Lavender Brown.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have quite liked to have hidden <PER>Harry</PER>'s face in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch <PER>Ron</PER> do his trial.
Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to McLaggen to tell <PER>Harry</PER> that, most unfortunately, <PER>Ron</PER> had beaten <PER>Harry</PER>, only to find McLaggen’s red face inches from his own.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned around to find <PER>Harry</PER>'s new team beaming at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You flew really well — ” “You did brilliantly, <PER>Ron</PER>!” This time it really was <PER>Hermione</PER> running toward them from the stands; <PER>Harry</PER> saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as himself grinned at the team and at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> bade good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt extremely hungry; <PER>Harry</PER> hoped there would be something to eat at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
“How are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> in a low voice, moving forward to stroke the feathery head.
“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast the door open!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, pulling out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding shocked.
“Stand back — ” But before <PER>Harry</PER> could say anything else, the door flew open again as <PER>Harry</PER> had known it would, and there stood <PER>Hagrid</PER>, glowering down at <PER>Harry</PER> and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.
<PER>Hermione</PER> scurried in after <PER>Harry</PER>, looking rather frightened.
“Well?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> grumpily, as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying Fang's head immediately upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s knee and drooling all over his robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> was hungry enough even for <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cooking, and took one at once.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done he a great personal wrong, “we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> gave another great snort.
There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a tiny shriek, and <PER>Ron</PER> leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed.
“What are they, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down <PER>Harry</PER>'s rock cake all the same.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders.
<PER>Harry</PER> had known <PER>Hagrid</PER> to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and <PER>Ron</PER> had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>’s frantic grimaces and head- shakings.
“I don’ think there is, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” choked <PER>Hagrid</PER>, attempting to stem the flood of his tears.
<PER>Ron</PER> merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but <PER>Harry</PER> caught <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s arm and held her back.
“But you should have heard the way he was talking about <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>!
“Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, and they hurried after <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, just the man I was hoping to see!” he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly.
“He’s got no chance of persuading <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot.
“This detention’s already been postponed once; <PER>Snape</PER> did it for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but <PER>Snape</PER> won’t do it for anyone else.” “Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hermione</PER> was thinking about McLaggen.
“I doubt you’ll be alone, <PER>Ginny</PER>’ll probably be invited,” snapped <PER>Ron</PER>, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn.
“Oh, look, your dad’s in here, <PER>Ron</PER> — he’s all right!” she added quickly, for <PER>Ron</PER> had looked around in alarm.
“Can you think of any way <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ?” “Oh, drop it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited <PER>Hermione</PER> and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, firing up.
“Well, as I’m not invited to any parties,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, getting to his feet again, “I think I’ll go to bed.” He stomped off toward the door to the boys’ dormitories, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> staring after <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> rarely appeared at meals anymore, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Hermione</PER> was right in thinking that <PER>Harry</PER> was leaving the school for days at a time.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> forgotten the lessons <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was supposed to be giving <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; <PER>Harry</PER> had felt bolstered, comforted, and now <PER>Harry</PER> felt slightly abandoned.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion- Making.
He did not usually lie in bed reading He's textbooks; that sort of behavior, as <PER>Ron</PER> rightly said, was indecent in anybody except <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was simply weird that way.
The more <PER>Harry</PER> pored over the book, the more <PER>Harry</PER> realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were earning <PER>Harry</PER> such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which <PER>Harry</PER> was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.
There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (<PER>Harry</PER> had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which <PER>Harry</PER> had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard.
The only person who did not find these charms amusing was <PER>Hermione</PER>, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if <PER>Harry</PER> had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity.
There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble: Levicorpus (nvbl) While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and <PER>Neville</PER> snored loudly, <PER>Harry</PER> stared at the letters in brackets.
Nvbl that had to mean “nonverbal.” <PER>Harry</PER> rather doubted <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to bring off this particular spell; <PER>Harry</PER> was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something <PER>Snape</PER> had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A.
<PER>Harry</PER> sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; <PER>Ron</PER> was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.
“Sorry!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and <PER>Neville</PER> picked <PER>Neville</PER> up from the floor, having fallen out of bed.
“Hang on — I’ll let you down — ” He groped for the potion book and riffled through the potion book in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last He located the potion book and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counter-jinx, <PER>Harry</PER> thought Liberacorpus\ with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might.
“Tomorrow,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a muffled voice, “I’d rather you set the alarm clock.” By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Molly’s hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, <PER>Ron</PER>’s shock had subsided and he had decided that <PER>Harry</PER>’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that <PER>Harry</PER> lost no time in regaling <PER>Hermione</PER> with the story as they sat down for breakfast. "
<PER>Hermione</PER> had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> frowned at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And also,” she added, as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> rolled their eyes, “because I’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.” Both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> shouted her down at once.
“Just a laugh, <PER>Hermione</PER>, that’s all!” “Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“I — Lupin told me.” This last part was not true; in fact, <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER>'s father use the spell on <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had never told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about that particular excursion into the Pensieve.
“Maybe your dad did use it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but he’s not the only one.
“If he’d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ would he?” Even as he said it, <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had been pure-blood, but <PER>Harry</PER> pushed the thought out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind; <PER>Harry</PER> would worry about that later.
“Thanks, <PER>Ginny</PER> It’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s next lesson!” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents.
<PER>Harry</PER> wrapped <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarf over <PER>Harry</PER>'s lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb.
More than once <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko’s Joke Shop had been boarded up, <PER>Harry</PER> took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun.
<PER>Ron</PER> pointed, with a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> staggered in his wake into the crowded shop.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed now!” said Slughorn, poking <PER>Harry</PER> genially in the chest.
This strategy meant that <PER>Ron</PER> was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with <PER>Ginny</PER>, imagining <PER>Hermione</PER> shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.
“Ah, well you can’t evade me forever, <PER>Harry</PER>!” And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of <PER>Ron</PER> as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters.
“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shaking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
“Oh, look — They’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those would last hours!” Glad that <PER>Hermione</PER> had changed the subject, <PER>Harry</PER> showed much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than <PER>Harry</PER> would normally have done, but <PER>Ron</PER> continued to look moody and merely shrugged when <PER>Hermione</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> where <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to go next.
As <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms.
Holding <PER>Harry</PER> fast with one hand, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” squealed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I — no — ” “Give it to me!” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you mustn’t!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>, as Mundungus started to turn blue.
There was a bang, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands fly off Mundungus’s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> swore at the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone.
The moment he was inside, <PER>Harry</PER> burst out, “<PER>Harry</PER> was nicking Sirius’s stuff.” “I know, <PER>Harry</PER>, but please don’t shout, people are staring,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Go and sit down, I’ll get you a drink.” <PER>Harry</PER> was still fuming when <PER>Hermione</PER> returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.
“Can’t they at least stop <PER>Harry</PER> stealing everything that’s not fixed down when <PER>Harry</PER>’s at headquarters?” “Shh!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at <PER>Harry</PER> with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’d be annoyed too, I know it’s your things <PER>Harry</PER>’s stealing — ” <PER>Harry</PER> gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, what are you staring at?” “Nothing,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, hastily looking away from the bar, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.
<PER>Harry</PER> was thinking about Sirius, and how <PER>Harry</PER> had hated those silver goblets anyway.
<PER>Hermione</PER> drummed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers on the table, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes flickering between <PER>Ron</PER> and the bar.
The moment <PER>Harry</PER> drained the last drops in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bottle she said, “Shall we call it a day and go back to school, then?” The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts strayed to <PER>Ginny</PER> as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush.
It was a little while before <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to <PER>Harry</PER> on the wind, had become shriller and louder.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katie’s legs, Katie fell on top of them; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> managed to catch Katie's but Katie was writhing so much they could hardly hold Katie.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat.
“Jus’ bin visitin’ Grawp, he’s cornin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ — ” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or something — ” “Wha?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, bending lower to hear what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying over the raging wind.
It took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Leanne were all trying to quiet her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hurried over to Katie’s wailing friend and put an arm around <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> bent down, his hand outstretched, but <PER>Harry</PER> seized his arm and pulled him back.
<PER>Hermione</PER> patted <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoulder gently.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t say who’d given it to <PER>Hermione</PER>, Leanne?” “No Leanne wouldn’t tell me and I said No Leanne was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but No Leanne just wouldn’t listen and and then I tried to grab it from No Leanne's and — and — ” No Leanne let out a wail of despair.
As they followed <PER>Hermione</PER> and Leanne up the road, <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking furiously.
They had just entered the grounds when <PER>Harry</PER> spoke, unable to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts to <PER>Harry</PER> any longer.
“Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes and didn’t that girl say Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?” “She said She came back from the bathroom with it, She didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — ” “<PER>McGonagall</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> warningly.
“Good lord,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Take this necklace to Professor <PER>Snape</PER> at once, but be sure not to touch this necklace, keep this necklace wrapped in the scarf!” <PER>Harry</PER> and the others followed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> upstairs and into her office.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> closed the door and swept around her desk to face <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the still sobbing Leanne.
“All right,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, not unkindly, “go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.” When Leanne had left the room, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> turned back to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What happened when Katie touched the necklace?” “Katie rose up in the air,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, before either <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> could speak, “and then began to scream, and collapsed.
“But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, I’m sure!” For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> did not invite confidences; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild.
“I think <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> gave Katie that necklace, Professor.” On one side of him, <PER>Ron</PER> rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, <PER>Hermione</PER> shuffled <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Do you have any proof?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but ” and <PER>Harry</PER> told her about following <PER>Malfoy</PER> to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Mister Borgin.
“Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> despairingly, “it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it!
“Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> purely because Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased.
<PER>Harry</PER> was angry with the other two for siding with <PER>McGonagall</PER>; nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER> felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> must be one of their top targets.
“Crabbe or Goyle — or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he’ll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up — ” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged looks that plainly said There’s no point arguing with him.
“It wasn’t very well thought-out at all.” “But since when has <PER>Malfoy</PER> been one of the world’s great thinkers?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> answered him.
Katie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that Katie had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target.
“Oh, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> knows, of course,” said <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever <PER>Harry</PER> mentioned his <PER>Malfoy</PER>-Is-a-Death-Eater theory.
<PER>Harry</PER> had wondered whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would return from wherever <PER>Harry</PER> had been in time for Monday night’s lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, <PER>Harry</PER> presented <PER>Harry</PER> outside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s office at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to enter.
There sat <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looking unusually tired; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand was as black and burned as ever, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gestured to <PER>Harry</PER> to sit down.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes, I expect so,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand.
“Sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> tentatively, “I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.” “Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered contempt,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, frowning a little.
“Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, after a short pause, “did Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> tell you what I told Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s after Katie got hurt?
“But what concerns me now, <PER>Harry</PER>, is our lesson.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second?
However, <PER>Harry</PER> said no more about <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but watched as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long-fingered hands.
“You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton.
“Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, “but she had a choice, didn’t she, not like my mother — ” “Your mother had a choice too,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gently.
“Yes, Merope <PER>Riddle</PER> chose death in spite of a son who needed she, but do not judge shis too harshly, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Nice suit, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> merely chuckled as they followed <PER>Harry</PER>'s younger self a short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings.
<PER>Harry</PER> and the older <PER>Dumbledore</PER> followed.
“Good afternoon,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, holding out <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand.
She invited <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to sit on a rickety chair and seated She behind a cluttered desk, eyeing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nervously.
“I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> and arrangements for his future,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Apparently <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thought so too, for <PER>Harry</PER> now saw <PER>Harry</PER> slip <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand out of the pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s velvet suit, at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mistress Cole’s desktop.
Smacking her lips frankly, her smiled at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for the first time, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t hesitate to press <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s advantage.
“You’ll be taking <PER>Dumbledore</PER> away, whatever?” “Whatever,” repeated <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gravely.
She squinted at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as though deciding whether or not to trust <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> drew up the hard wooden chair beside <PER>Riddle</PER>, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.
“I am Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “ ‘Professor?” repeated <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“Hogwarts,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> went on, as though he had not heard <PER>Riddle</PER>’s last words, “is a school for people with special abilities — ” “I’m not mad!” “I know that you are not mad.
<PER>Riddle</PER> had frozen, <PER>Riddle</PER>'s face expressionless, but <PER>Riddle</PER>'s eyes were flickering back and forth between each of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, as though trying to catch one of them lying.
“Are you a wizard too?” “Yes, I am.” “Prove it,” said <PER>Riddle</PER> at once, in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said, “Tell the truth.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyebrows.
To his great surprise, however, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drew <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand from an inside pocket of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick.
<PER>Riddle</PER> jumped to his feet; <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly blame <PER>Harry</PER> for howling in shock and rage; all <PER>Harry</PER>'s worldly possessions must be in there.
But even as <PER>Riddle</PER> rounded on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.
<PER>Riddle</PER> stared from the wardrobe to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; then, <PER>Riddle</PER>'s expression greedy, <PER>Riddle</PER> pointed at the wand.
<PER>Riddle</PER> threw <PER>Dumbledore</PER> a long, clear, calculating look.
<PER>Riddle</PER> took off the lid and tipped the contents onto <PER>Riddle</PER>'s bed without looking at them.
“You will return they to their owners with your apologies,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly, putting <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand back into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s jacket.
When he had finished, he turned to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and said baldly, “I haven’t got any money.” “That is easily remedied,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, drawing a leather money-pouch from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s pocket.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would insist upon accompanying <PER>Riddle</PER>, but once again <PER>Harry</PER> was surprised.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> handed <PER>Riddle</PER> the envelope containing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s list of equipment, and after telling <PER>Riddle</PER> exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “You will be able to see it, although Muggles around you — non-magical people, that is — will not.
“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t have died,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>, more to <PER>Riddle</PER> than <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet and held out <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand again.
“It is unusual,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, after a moment’s hesitation, “but not unheard of.” His tone was casual but His's eyes moved curiously over <PER>Riddle</PER>’s face.
“Sit down,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, landing beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> obeyed, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind still full of what <PER>Harry</PER> had just seen.
“<PER>Harry</PER> believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, when you told <PER>Harry</PER> was a wizard,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I didn’t believe <PER>Hagrid</PER> at first, when <PER>Harry</PER> told me.” “Yes, <PER>Riddle</PER> was perfectly ready to believe that he was — to use his word — ‘special,’ ” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, for <PER>Harry</PER> had come to a halt.
“But I thought you might have the mouth organ or something.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> beamed at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, peering over the top of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s half-moon spectacles.
“Very astute, <PER>Harry</PER>, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ.” And on that enigmatic note he waved to <PER>Harry</PER>, who understood himself to be dismissed.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been unable to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about <PER>Harry</PER>'s lesson with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but <PER>Harry</PER> filled them in as them walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.
“Wow, scary thought, the boy <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this term’s project, and began pulling on their protective gloves.
“But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says it’s all important and it’ll help me survive.” “I think it’s fascinating,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> earnestly.
“You’re lagging behind, everybody else has started, and <PER>Neville</PER>’s already got <PER>Neville</PER>’s's first pod!” They looked around; sure enough, there sat <PER>Neville</PER> with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of <PER>Neville</PER>'s face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.
“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, adding quietly, when she had turned away again, “should’ve used Muffliato, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “No, we shouldn’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once, looking, as <PER>Hermione</PER> always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his spells.
One tangled itself in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hair, and <PER>Ron</PER> beat it back with a pair of secateurs; <PER>Harry</PER> succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; <PER>Hermione</PER> plunged <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and <PER>Hermione</PER> snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like <PER>Neville</PER>’s.
“Pass me a bowl,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, holding the pulsating pod at arm’s length; <PER>Harry</PER> handed one over and <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped the pulsating pod into it with a look of disgust on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“Anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to have a Christmas party, <PER>Harry</PER>, and there’s no way you’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.” <PER>Harry</PER> groaned.
Meanwhile, <PER>Ron</PER>, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, “And this is another party just for Slughorn’s favorites, is it?” “Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to retrieve The pod; when <PER>Harry</PER> got back, <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying, “Look, !
“Reparo,” <PER>Harry</PER> said hastily, poking the pieces with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and the bowl sprang back together again.
The crash, however, appeared to have awoken <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>’s presence.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for <PER>Hermione</PER>'s copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; <PER>Ron</PER>, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.
“Hand that over, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hurriedly.
It was not as though he was really surprised, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure how <PER>Harry</PER> felt about it.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER> were now too embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> started going out together, then split up?
Could <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER>'s friendship survive it?
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; <PER>Harry</PER> had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between they.
“Gotcha!” yelled <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling a second pod from the stump just as <PER>Hermione</PER> managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER>'s two friends more closely over the next few days, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual.
<PER>Harry</PER> supposed <PER>Harry</PER> would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn’s dimly lit room on the night of the party.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not think <PER>Harry</PER> could stand another full- House tryout.
Over Dean’s shoulder, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Seamus Finnigan slamming <PER>Harry</PER>'s books into Seamus Finnigan's bag, looking sour.
One of the reasons why <PER>Harry</PER> would have preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that <PER>Harry</PER> knew Seamus would not like it.
There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> had now chosen two of <PER>Harry</PER>'s classmates for the team.
As <PER>Harry</PER> had endured much worse mutterings than this in <PER>Harry</PER>'s school career, <PER>Harry</PER> was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin.
If Gryffindor won, <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized <PER>Harry</PER> and swear that they had always known it was a great team.
If they lost well, <PER>Harry</PER> thought wryly, <PER>Harry</PER> had still endured worse mutterings.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no reason to regret <PER>Harry</PER>'s choice once <PER>Harry</PER> saw Dean fly that evening; <PER>Harry</PER> worked well with <PER>Ginny</PER> and Demelza.
<PER>Harry</PER> had known all along that <PER>Ron</PER> was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all <PER>Harry</PER>'s old insecurities.
“You prat, <PER>Ron</PER>, look at the state of her!” “I can fix that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelza’s mouth, and saying “Episkey.” “And <PER>Ginny</PER>, don’t call <PER>Ron</PER> a prat, you’re not the Captain of this team — ” “Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should — ” <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> not to laugh.
“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind <PER>Ginny</PER>.
When <PER>Harry</PER> pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, their found their looking at Dean and <PER>Ginny</PER>, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together.
It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach, clawing at <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides: Hot blood seemed to flood <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly.
Dean gave <PER>Harry</PER> a shifty grin that <PER>Harry</PER> did not return, as the newborn monster inside <PER>Harry</PER> was roaring for Dean’s instant dismissal from the team.
“Right,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at <PER>Ron</PER>, “let’s get this straight once and for all.
“D’you think I want people saying my sister’s a — ” “A what?” shouted <PER>Ginny</PER>, drawing <PER>Ginny</PER>'s wand.
“A what, exactly?” “He doesn’t mean anything, <PER>Ginny</PER> — ” said <PER>Harry</PER> automatically, though the monster was roaring its approval of <PER>Ron</PER>’s words.
“No, I will not!” yelled <PER>Ginny</PER>, beside <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” <PER>Ron</PER> roared, trying to get a clear shot at <PER>Ginny</PER> around <PER>Harry</PER>, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched.
“Just because I don’t do it in public — !” <PER>Ginny</PER> screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push <PER>Harry</PER> out of the way.
“Don’t be stupid — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>’s snogged <PER>Cho</PER> Chang!” shouted <PER>Ginny</PER>, who sounded close to tears now.
“And <PER>Hermione</PER> snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something disgusting, <PER>Ron</PER>, and that’s because you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!” And with that, she stormed away.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly let go of <PER>Ron</PER>; the look on his face was murderous.
<PER>Harry</PER> hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; <PER>Harry</PER> felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this.
The monster in his chest purred but then his saw <PER>Ron</PER> ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on <PER>Harry</PER>, shouting things like “betrayal of trust” “supposed to be my friend” “D’you think <PER>Hermione</PER> did snog Krum?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave a guilty start and wrenched <PER>Harry</PER>'s imagination away from a corridor in which no <PER>Ron</PER> intruded, in which <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> were quite alone — “What?” <PER>Harry</PER> said confusedly.
However, <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to gather the worst from the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
Neither of they mentioned <PER>Ginny</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster and trying to convince <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings for <PER>Ginny</PER> were entirely elder- brotherly.
She’s <PER>Ron</PER>’s sister, <PER>Harry</PER> told himself firmly.
<PER>Harry</PER> awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which <PER>Ron</PER> had chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday <PER>Harry</PER> would have happily exchanged the dream <PER>Ron</PER> for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered <PER>Hermione</PER> with an icy, sneering indifference.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent the day attempting to keep the peace between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> with no success; finally, <PER>Hermione</PER> departed for bed in high dudgeon, and <PER>Ron</PER> stalked off to the boys’ dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s dismay, <PER>Ron</PER>’s new aggression did not wear off over the next few days.
“ENOUGH!” bellowed <PER>Harry</PER>, who had seen <PER>Ginny</PER> glowering in <PER>Ron</PER>’s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat- Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand.
Nothing <PER>Harry</PER> tried boosting <PER>Ron</PER>’s confidence all through dinner, but <PER>Ron</PER> was too busy being grumpy and surly with <PER>Hermione</PER> to notice.
<PER>Harry</PER> persisted in the common room that evening, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s assertion that the whole team would be devastated if <PER>Ron</PER> left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about <PER>Ron</PER> and casting <PER>Harry</PER> nasty looks.
Finally <PER>Harry</PER> tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking <PER>Ron</PER> into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; <PER>Ron</PER> went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it <PER>Harry</PER>'s first as Captain, but <PER>Harry</PER> was determined to beat <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> at Quidditch even if <PER>Harry</PER> could not yet prove <PER>Harry</PER>'s suspicions about <PER>Harry</PER>.
If only there was something he could do to make <PER>Ron</PER> pull himself together make him play at the top of himself's form something that would ensure that <PER>Ron</PER> had a really good day.
The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> approached.
<PER>Harry</PER> grinned and waved; <PER>Ron</PER> grimaced weakly and shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
A few minutes later <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had become so tired of <PER>Ron</PER>’s recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on shis way up the table.
“Fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who was concentrating on handing <PER>Ron</PER> a glass of pumpkin juice.
“Don’t drink that, <PER>Ron</PER>!” Both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked up at her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Hermione</PER> could not believe <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, I warn you, don’t drink it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said again, alarmed, but <PER>Ron</PER> picked up the glass, drained the glass in one gulp, and said, “Stop bossing me around, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked scandalized.
“Pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> and Demelza were already wearing <PER>Ginny</PER> and Demelza's Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room.
“Conditions look ideal,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
“They’re playing Harper instead; Harper’s in my year and Harper’s an idiot.” <PER>Harry</PER> smiled back vaguely, but as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> had once before claimed <PER>Malfoy</PER> could not play due to injury, but on that occasion <PER>Malfoy</PER> had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> not playing?” “Lucky, I call it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking slightly more animated.
“My drink my pumpkin juice you didn’t ?” <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyebrows, but said nothing except, “Well be starting in about five minutes, you’d better get your boots on.” They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos.
“Captains shake hands,” she said, and <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart.
<PER>Harry</PER> soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> craned around on <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom to look toward the commentator’s podium.
With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, <PER>Ron</PER> having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and <PER>Ginny</PER> having scored four of Gryffindor’s six goals.
This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because <PER>Harry</PER> liked them, and <PER>Harry</PER> started on Peakes and Coote instead.
“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a Beater,” said Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a bit more muscle — ” “Hit a Bludger at Coote!” <PER>Harry</PER> called to Coote as <PER>Harry</PER> zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing <PER>Harry</PER> in the opposite direction.
“Thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?” said a snide voice, and <PER>Harry</PER> was nearly knocked off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom as Harper collided with <PER>Harry</PER> hard and deliberately.
<PER>Harry</PER> shoulder aching, <PER>Harry</PER> raced after <PER>Harry</PER>, determined to ram <PER>Harry</PER> back .
But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky — Smith was right and <PER>Harry</PER> was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at random; Harper had spotted what <PER>Harry</PER> had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.
<PER>Harry</PER> accelerated; the wind was whistling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears so that it drowned all sound of Smith’s commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of Harper, and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost and now Harper was feet from it, Harper's hand outstretched.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, where ’re you going?” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team, but <PER>Ginny</PER> sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, <PER>Ginny</PER> collided with the commentator’s podium.
As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring; <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ginny</PER> saying blithely to an irate Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.” Laughing, <PER>Harry</PER> broke free of the rest of the team and hugged <PER>Ginny</PER>, but let go very quickly.
“C’mon, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Demelza!” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> were the last two in the changing room.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was twisting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Gryffindor scarf in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands and looked upset but determined.
“What are you two talking about?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, turning away to hang up <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes so that neither of them would see <PER>Harry</PER> grinning.
“Yes you did, <PER>Harry</PER>, and that’s why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing and <PER>Ron</PER> saved everything!” “I didn’t put it in!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning broadly.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that <PER>Hermione</PER> had seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand that morning.
“I wanted <PER>Ron</PER> to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.” He looked at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on <PER>Hermione</PER>, imitating her voice.
“Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER> into the sudden silence; <PER>Harry</PER> had not expected <PER>Harry</PER>'s plan to backfire like this, “shall shall we go up to the party, then?” “You go!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, blinking back tears.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great sense of letdown; <PER>Harry</PER> had been sure that if <PER>Ron</PER> won the match, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would be friends again immediately.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not see how <PER>Harry</PER> could possibly explain to <PER>Hermione</PER> that what <PER>Hermione</PER> had done to offend <PER>Ron</PER> was kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred so long ago.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see <PER>Hermione</PER> at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when <PER>Harry</PER> arrived.
Renewed cheers and clapping greeted <PER>Harry</PER>'s appearance, and <PER>Harry</PER> was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating <PER>Harry</PER>.
What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled <PER>Harry</PER>, laughing at <PER>Harry</PER>'s least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned away from <PER>Ron</PER>, who did not look like <PER>Harry</PER> would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing.
With a sinking feeling, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight.
He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed <PER>Ron</PER>, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “<PER>Ron</PER> seems to be enjoying the celebrations.” “Er does he?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Don’t pretend you didn’t see <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s horror, <PER>Ron</PER> came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.
“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was staring at <PER>Ron</PER>, who refused to look at <PER>Hermione</PER>, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, “Hi, <PER>Harry</PER>!
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> spun around to see <PER>Hermione</PER> pointing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at <PER>Ron</PER>, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward <PER>Ron</PER>, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh the birds could reach.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard a sob before it slammed.
Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time <PER>Harry</PER> went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however, <PER>Harry</PER>’s frequent nighttime wanderings had given <PER>Harry</PER> an unusually good knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that <PER>Harry</PER> was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> much preferred this new laughing, joking <PER>Ron</PER> to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved <PER>Ron</PER> came at a heavy price.
Firstly, <PER>Harry</PER> had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing <PER>Ron</PER> as a moment wasted; and secondly, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again.
<PER>Ron</PER>, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone.
Determined as he was to remain friends with both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight.
“I never promised <PER>Hermione</PER> anything,” <PER>Ron</PER> mumbled.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s voice tailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> caught the words “Krum” and “can’t complain” again.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s schedule was so full that <PER>Harry</PER> could only talk to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s properly in the evenings, when <PER>Ron</PER> was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> refused to sit in the common room while <PER>Ron</PER> was there, so <PER>Harry</PER> generally joined <PER>Hermione</PER>'s in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice might soon vanish from lack of use.
“And incidentally,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, after a few moments, “you need to be careful.” “For the last time,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, speaking in a slightly hoarse whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence, “I am not giving back this book, I’ve learned more from the Half-Blood Prince than <PER>Snape</PER> or Slughorn have taught me in — ” “I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hitched up the long roll of parchment on which <PER>Hermione</PER> was writing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s quill.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Hermione</PER>'s with <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind a long way away.
“I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” “And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, still concentrating on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s essay.
“It’s part of all the owls's Owl Order Service.” “You know a lot about it.” <PER>Hermione</PER> gave him the kind of nasty look <PER>Hermione</PER> had just given him's copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
“ — so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a cough potion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead; <PER>Harry</PER> had heard it too.
“Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct — what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?” “It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily, snatching <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand.
She looked as though She might have a seizure; <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had hastily packed Shis things, grabbed <PER>Harry</PER> by the arm and frogmarched <PER>Harry</PER> away.
“Sooner you ask someone, sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you can — ” But <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face suddenly turned blank; <PER>Hermione</PER> had just spotted <PER>Ron</PER> and Lavender, who were entwined in the same armchair.
“Well, good night, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though it was only seven o’clock in the evening, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left for the girls’ dormitory without another word.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to bed comforting <PER>Harry</PER> that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn’s party, after which he and <PER>Ron</PER> would depart together for the Burrow.
It now seemed impossible that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of them's behavior .
<PER>Hermione</PER> laughed unkindly at <PER>Ron</PER>’s disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give he a spectacular handlebar mustache; <PER>Ron</PER> retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of <PER>Hermione</PER> jumping up and down in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s seat every time Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced <PER>Hermione</PER> to the verge of tears again.
She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half Shis things behind; <PER>Harry</PER>, deciding that Shis need was greater than <PER>Ron</PER>’s just now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her.
“Oh yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a choked voice, taking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that <PER>Hermione</PER> was wiping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s pencil case.
“Anyonel And you chose Loony Lovegood?” “Don’t call her that, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Ginny</PER>, pausing behind <PER>Harry</PER> on her way to join friends.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to feel pleased that <PER>Ginny</PER> was glad <PER>Harry</PER> was taking Luna to the party, but could not quite manage it.
A long way along the table, <PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting alone, playing with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s stew.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed <PER>Ron</PER> looking at her furtively.
Squeezing her in between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, Lavender flung her arms around <PER>Ron</PER>’s neck.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at <PER>Hermione</PER> in Transfiguration.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw that <PER>Hermione</PER> was beaming back, if possible even more brightly.
“Hi, Parvati!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER> and Lavender completely.
<PER>Hermione</PER> acted as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had not seen or heard anything.
“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with a most un-<PER>Hermione</PER>-ish giggle.
When <PER>Harry</PER> arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night, <PER>Harry</PER> found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at <PER>Harry</PER> resentfully as <PER>Harry</PER> approached Luna.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna had squeezed in through the door.
Gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so tightly <PER>Harry</PER> might have been hoping to Disapparate with <PER>Harry</PER>, Slughorn led <PER>Harry</PER> purposefully into the party; <PER>Harry</PER> seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend Sanguini.” Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
“I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, ‘Where is the biography of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter for which we have all been waiting?’ ” “Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “were you?” “Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple.
“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea — ” “I’m definitely not interested,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, “and I’ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled Luna after <PER>Harry</PER> into the crowd; <PER>Harry</PER> had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters.
“I thought he’d annoy <PER>Ron</PER> most,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> dispassionately.
Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, <PER>Harry</PER> drew closer to <PER>Hermione</PER> and said, “Let’s get something straight.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, if you can ask out McLaggen — ” “There’s a difference,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with dignity.
“I’ve got no plans to tell <PER>Ron</PER> anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.” “Good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> fervently.
“Because <PER>Harry</PER>’ll just fall apart again, and we’ll lose the next match — ” “Quidditch!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily.
“No, sorry,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> turned quickly to join in Luna’s conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.
“You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death — never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think even you, Severus — ” “Really?” said <PER>Snape</PER> quietly, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes still boring into <PER>Harry</PER>, who felt a certain disquiet.
Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, his saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.
And why was <PER>Snape</PER> looking at <PER>Malfoy</PER> as though both angry and was it possible?
But almost before <PER>Harry</PER> had registered what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath; <PER>Malfoy</PER> had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and <PER>Snape</PER>’s face was smoothly inscrutable again.
It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; him had watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> do that to <PER>Snape</PER> for a long time.
This was the first time he had seen <PER>Malfoy</PER> close up for ages; he now saw that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin.
“I’d like a word with you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER> suddenly.
“Follow me, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.” They left, <PER>Snape</PER> leading the way, <PER>Malfoy</PER> looking resentful.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, “I’ll be back in a bit, Luna — er — bathroom.” “All right,” she said cheerfully, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard she, as <PER>Harry</PER> hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested.
What was more difficult was finding <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran down the corridor, the noise of <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn ’s office behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
Perhaps <PER>Snape</PER> had taken <PER>Malfoy</PER> to <PER>Snape</PER>'s office in the dungeons or perhaps <PER>Snape</PER> was escorting <PER>Snape</PER> back to the Slytherin common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear against door after door as <PER>Harry</PER> dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, <PER>Harry</PER> crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. "
What had happened to make <PER>Malfoy</PER> speak to <PER>Snape</PER> like this — <PER>Snape</PER>, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?
Then <PER>Snape</PER> said, “You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things.” “You’d better stop telling me to come to your office then!” “Listen to me,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, his voice so low now that <PER>Harry</PER> had to push <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear very hard against the keyhole to hear.
Hardly daring to breathe, <PER>Harry</PER> remained crouched down as <PER>Snape</PER> emerged slowly from the classroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> expression unfathomable, <PER>Harry</PER> returned to the party.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained on the floor, hidden beneath the cloak, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind racing.
“So <PER>Snape</PER> was offering to help <PER>Snape</PER>?
“Yes, <PER>Snape</PER> was offering to help himl” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He said He’d promised <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s mother to protect him, that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something — “An Unbreakable Vow?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking stunned.
“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, <PER>Ron</PER>ald,” said George, “what is this we hear from <PER>Ginny</PER> about you and a young lady called — unless our information is faulty — Lavender Brown?” <PER>Ron</PER> turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts.
“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the attic, and if Fleur shares with <PER>Ginny</PER> — ” “ — that’ll make <PER>Ginny</PER>’s Christmas — ” muttered Fred.
“I promised <PER>Dumbledore</PER> I wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here.” “Oh yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> peeled a few more sprouts and then said, “Are you going to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what you heard <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> saying to each other?” “Yep,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No one’s that good an actor, not even <PER>Snape</PER>.” “Yeah I’m just saying, though,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to him's new evidence; him could hear <PER>Hermione</PER> now: Obviously, <PER>Harry</PER>, him was pretending to offer help so him could trick <PER>Malfoy</PER> into telling him what him’s doing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had disappeared from Slughorn’s parry before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room.
Still, even <PER>Hermione</PER> would not be able to deny one thing: <PER>Malfoy</PER> was definitely up to something, and <PER>Snape</PER> knew it, so <PER>Harry</PER> felt fully justified in saying “I told you so,” which <PER>Harry</PER> had done several times to <PER>Ron</PER> already.
Fred, George, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as Fred pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted to say; as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> marshaled <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called “You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.” “Arthur, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?” “I checked, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Arthur at once.
It’s left me for a spell “Has it occurred to you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Arthur, “that <PER>Snape</PER> was simply pretending — ?” “Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s up to?” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, I am speaking the truth,” he added, as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled a skeptical expression.
<PER>Harry</PER>, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had reminded <PER>Harry</PER> that there was something <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half- Blood Prince?” “The Half-Blood what?” “Prince,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching <PER>Harry</PER> closely for signs of recognition.
“I saw <PER>Harry</PER> in the Pensieve, <PER>Harry</PER> used it on <PER>Snape</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure <PER>Harry</PER> had achieved the right effect; Lupin’s smile was a little too understanding.
“Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “but <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t the only one.
“Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.” He looked into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and then said quietly, “James was a pureblood, <PER>Harry</PER>, and I promise you, James never asked us to call James ‘Prince.’ ” Abandoning pretense, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “And it wasn’t Sirius?
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> climbed all the way up to <PER>Ron</PER>’s attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> fell asleep almost immediately, but <PER>Harry</PER> delved into <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed.
There <PER>Harry</PER> turned its pages, searching, until <PER>Harry</PER> finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published.
Feeling disappointed, <PER>Harry</PER> threw the book back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and <PER>Snape</PER>, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children.
He hesitated a moment, then said, “Is <PER>Hermione</PER> really going out with McLaggen?” “I dunno,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> would,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“But let’s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.” A moment later, <PER>Harry</PER> had given a loud yell and leapt out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.
“Very thoughtful.” “I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, which sobered <PER>Ron</PER> up at once.
“Parsnips, Remus?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; “<PER>Harry</PER> felt goose bumps erupt up “<PER>Harry</PER>'s neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.
<PER>Harry</PER> guessed that <PER>Harry</PER> had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house.
Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know <PER>Harry</PER>’s name convincing, or find it natural that <PER>Harry</PER> should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when <PER>Ginny</PER>, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up Percy's family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to <PER>Harry</PER> alone.
“Wonderful!” said Scrimgeour, standing back to let <PER>Harry</PER> pass through the door ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Percy had, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, been Head of the Auror office; <PER>Harry</PER> looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bowler hat.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that Scrimgeour was watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted all these whispers of a prophecy of you being ‘the <PER>Cho</PER>sen One’” They were getting near it now, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here. "
I assume that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has discussed these matters with you?” <PER>Harry</PER> deliberated, wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> ought to lie or not.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see, out of the corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye, Scrimgeour squinting at <PER>Harry</PER>, so <PER>Harry</PER> pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron.
“And what has <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Sorry, but that’s between us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
He kept He's voice as pleasant as He could, and Scrimgeour’s tone, too, was light and friendly as He said, “Oh, of course, if it’s a question of confidences, I wouldn’t want you to divulge no, no and in any case, does it really matter whether you are ‘the <PER>Cho</PER>sen One’ or not?” ” <PER>Harry</PER> had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding.
The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and <PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes fixed upon it.
<PER>Harry</PER> was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to the gnome, “Funny little chaps, aren’t they?
“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, “you’d like to give the impression that I’m working for the Ministry?” “It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that <PER>Harry</PER> had cottoned on so quickly.
“Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the Ministry!” “Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck people in prison,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper rising now.
There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER> had forced Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER> to carve into Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s own flesh: !
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s man through and through, aren’t you, Potter?” “Yeah, I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts.
“Don’t cry, Mum,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, patting <PER>Ginny</PER>'s on the back as Molly sobbed into Molly's shoulder.
When <PER>Ginny</PER> had arrived, all three of them trooped out of <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s office and off toward Gryffindor Tower.
In the distance, <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> feeding Buckbeak in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin.
“Did you have a good Christmas?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER> at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim — ” “I’ve got something for you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, neither looking at <PER>Ron</PER> nor giving any sign that she had heard him.
“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, rolling <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes as <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way into the packed common room.
Leaving <PER>Ron</PER> and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match, <PER>Harry</PER> led <PER>Hermione</PER> over to the spare table.
“Look, <PER>Hermione</PER>, can’t you — ?” “No, I can’t,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said flatly.
When he had finished, <PER>Hermione</PER> sat in thought for a moment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?” “ — he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick <PER>Malfoy</PER> into telling he what he’s doing?” “Well, yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad and Lupin think so,” <PER>Harry</PER> said grudgingly.
“And he’s acting on <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s orders, just like I said!” “Hmm did either of them actually mention <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name?” <PER>Harry</PER> frowned, trying to remember.
“I’m not sure <PER>Snape</PER> definitely said your master,’ and who else would that be?” “I don’t know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, biting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip.
“How’s Lupin?” “Not great,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> told her all about Lupin’s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing.
“Unless “Oh, come on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in exasperation, “you can’t get round this one!” “Well there is the possibility it was an empty threat.” “You’re unbelievable, you are,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom.
<PER>Ron</PER> was just taking out his quill to sign after <PER>Hermione</PER> when Lavender crept up behind him, slipped Lavender's hands over him's eyes, and trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” <PER>Harry</PER> turned to see <PER>Hermione</PER> stalking off; <PER>Harry</PER> caught up with <PER>Hermione</PER>, having no wish to stay behind with <PER>Ron</PER> and Lavender, but to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surprise, <PER>Ron</PER> caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled.
Without a word, <PER>Hermione</PER> sped up to walk with <PER>Neville</PER>.
“So — Apparition,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his tone making it perfectly plain that <PER>Harry</PER> was not to mention what had just happened.
“Fred and George did.” “Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?” “Yeah, but “Charlie’s bigger than me” — <PER>Ron</PER> held his arms out from — <PER>Ron</PER>'s body as though he was a gorilla — “so Fred and George didn’t go on about it much not to his face anyway ” “When can we take the actual test?” “Soon as we’re seventeen.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s already Apparated,” <PER>Ron</PER> told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of himself's wand and set Seamus lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.” “Dum — er — someone took him.
All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when <PER>Harry</PER> told All of them how uncomfortable it was, and <PER>Harry</PER> was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to lie and say that <PER>Harry</PER> needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for <PER>Harry</PER>'s lesson with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
It did not seem to have healed at all and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said that <PER>Harry</PER> would know eventually and there was, in any case, another subject <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to discuss.
But before <PER>Harry</PER> could say anything about <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke.
“After <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” “I told <PER>Cornelius</PER> there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when <PER>Cornelius</PER> left office.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s intense embarrassment, <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own knees.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke, however, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s voice was quite steady.
“I am very touched, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you’re not at Hogwarts,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still looking fixedly at his knees.
“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now sounding cheerful, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought it safe to look up again.
“It’s about <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.” “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Yes, sir.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished <PER>Harry</PER> did not speak for a few moments, then said, “Thank you for telling me this, <PER>Harry</PER>, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind.
“Professor, did you understand — ?” “Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, a little sharply.
Did this mean that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had indeed ordered <PER>Snape</PER> to find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was doing, in which case he had already heard everything <PER>Harry</PER> had just told him from <PER>Snape</PER>?
“So, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in what <PER>Harry</PER> hoped was a polite, calm voice, “you definitely still trust — ?” “I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not sound very tolerant anymore.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ignored <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
As though he had read <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head.
“I have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of both is, I think, the most important I have collected.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not say anything to this; <PER>Harry</PER> still felt angry at the reception <PER>Harry</PER>'s confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further.
“So,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, in a ringing voice, “we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER> was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered for a moment whether <PER>Harry</PER> was dead.
There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy <PER>Harry</PER> recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and handsome — the teenage <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“ Who are you, then?” “I’m Morfin, ain’t 1?” “ Marvolo’ s son?” “ ’Course I am, then ” Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see <PER>Riddle</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> wore Marvolo’s black-stoned ring on his right hand.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was gazing at Morfin as though appraising <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s possibilities.
Now <PER>Voldemort</PER> moved a little closer and said, “<PER>Riddle</PER> came back?” “Ar, <PER>Voldemort</PER> left her, and serve her right, marrying filth\” said Morfin, spitting on the floor again.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s fingers closed tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and they were soaring back into the present again.
The soft golden light in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office seemed to dazzle <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes after that impenetrable darkness.
“Why did it go dark, what happened?” “Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, gesturing <PER>Harry</PER> back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
“When <PER>Harry</PER> awoke next morning, <PER>Harry</PER> was lying on the floor, quite alone.
“So if you’re underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard’s house, the Ministry won’t know?” “They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing but the face of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who was standing beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Harry</PER> had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.
“Time to go.” And <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the mg in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said that this was the most important memory of all, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could not see what was so significant about it.
“As you might have noticed,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, reseating himself behind his desk, “that memory has been tampered with.” “Tampered with?” repeated <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting back down too.
“Good night, sir.” As he closed the study door behind he, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, “I can’t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry.
The next day <PER>Harry</PER> confided in both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the task that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had set him, though separately, for <PER>Hermione</PER> still refused to remain in <PER>Ron</PER>’s presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look.
<PER>Ron</PER> thought that <PER>Harry</PER> was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all.
“After all, when has Won- Won’s judgment ever been faulty?” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, can’t you — ?” “iVo!” she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> alone and ankle-deep in snow.
Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had to share a desk.
Today, <PER>Hermione</PER> moved <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cauldron around the table so that <PER>Hermione</PER> was close to Ernie, and ignored both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What’ve you done?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s haughty profile.
which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion’s ingredients by Scarpin’s Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that added component that will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements — ” <PER>Ron</PER> was sitting beside <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth half open, doodling absently on <PER>Harry</PER>'s new copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
<PER>Ron</PER> kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on <PER>Hermione</PER> to help he out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on. "
He glanced around at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything <PER>Harry</PER> had done.
“You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s trusty copy of Advanced Potion- Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now waving <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand enthusiastically over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cauldron.
Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell <PER>Hermione</PER> was doing because <PER>Hermione</PER> was now so good at nonverbal incantations that <PER>Hermione</PER> did not need to say the words aloud.
Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, “Specialis Reveliol” over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hastened to imitate him.
It took <PER>Harry</PER> only five minutes to realize that <PER>Harry</PER>'s reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s expression could not have been any smugger; <PER>Hermione</PER> had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s poison into ten different crystal phials.
“A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.” It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had <PER>Snape</PER> still been their teacher, <PER>Harry</PER> would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures.
<PER>Harry</PER> hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged within the store cupboard, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until <PER>Harry</PER> found, at the very back, a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized one, put the box back in the cupboard, and hurried back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron.
Nobody had finished the task, although <PER>Hermione</PER> was trying to cram a few more ingredients into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bottle before Slughorn reached her.
“What have you got to show me?” <PER>Harry</PER> held out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, the bezoar sitting on <PER>Harry</PER>'s palm.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered, for a moment, whether <PER>Harry</PER> was going to shout at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> threw back <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and roared with laughter.
“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed.
“Come on, now, <PER>Harry</PER>, you’ll be late for your next lesson,” said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on <PER>Harry</PER>'s dragon- skin briefcase.
“Sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, reminding himself irresistibly of <PER>Voldemort</PER>, “I wanted to ask you something.” “Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> was at all sympathetic when <PER>Harry</PER> told them of this disastrous interview.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was still seething at the way <PER>Harry</PER> had triumphed without doing the work properly.
<PER>Ron</PER> was resentful that <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too.
Infuriated by him's failure and by <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s attitudes, <PER>Harry</PER> brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn.
<PER>Harry</PER> decided that, for the time being, <PER>Harry</PER> would let Slughorn think that <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack.
When <PER>Harry</PER> did not question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual affectionate treatment of <PER>Harry</PER>, and appeared to have put the matter from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
<PER>Harry</PER> awaited an invitation to one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if <PER>Harry</PER> had to reschedule Quidditch practice.
<PER>Harry</PER> checked with <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>: Neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as them knew, had anybody else.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as <PER>Harry</PER> appeared, simply determined to give <PER>Harry</PER> no additional opportunities to question <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was so shocked, <PER>Hermione</PER> even forgot that <PER>Hermione</PER> was annoyed at <PER>Harry</PER> for <PER>Harry</PER>'s trick with the bezoar.
When <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived in the Hall (<PER>Ron</PER> had come down with Lavender), they found that the tables had disappeared.
Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as them assembled in front of Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout — the Heads of Houses — and a small wizard whom <PER>Harry</PER> took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished <PER>Harry</PER>'s substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> had flushed a dull pink; <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked furious as <PER>Malfoy</PER> stepped away from Crabbe, with whom <PER>Malfoy</PER> appeared to have been having a whispered argument.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced quickly at <PER>Snape</PER>, who also looked annoyed, though <PER>Harry</PER> strongly suspected that this was less because of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s rudeness than the fact that <PER>McGonagall</PER> had reprimanded one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s House.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, where are you going?” demanded <PER>Hermione</PER>.
But <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer; <PER>Harry</PER> was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, <PER>Harry</PER> managed to position <PER>Harry</PER> right at the back of the crowd, directly behind <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous.
“I don’t know how much longer, all right?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> shot at him, oblivious to <PER>Harry</PER> standing right behind him.
“Look, it’s none of your business what I’m doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you’re told and keep a lookout!” “I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want my friends to keep a lookout for me,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, just loud enough for <PER>Malfoy</PER> to hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> spun around on the spot, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hand flying to <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand, but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, “Quiet!” and silence fell again.
<PER>Harry</PER> gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by <PER>Harry</PER>'s hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else.
This proved impossible, as <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stop puzzling over what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was doing that needed lookouts.
<PER>Harry</PER> bit back a laugh and hastily returned <PER>Harry</PER>'s gaze to <PER>Harry</PER>'s own hoop.
“— two — ” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to fix <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts on <PER>Harry</PER>'s hoop again; <PER>Harry</PER> had already forgotten what the three D’s stood for.
The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; <PER>Neville</PER> was flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until his caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at Dean Thomas.
“How did you do?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, hurrying toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glancing over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder to see where <PER>Malfoy</PER> was, and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall.
They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until They set fire to They's own pants, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> simply turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts.
“Up here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys’ staircase.
<PER>Harry</PER> flung open <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and began to rummage in it, while <PER>Ron</PER> watched impatiently.
“<PER>Harry</PER> ” “<PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts.
“Help me find <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> urgently.
<PER>Harry</PER> laid the map upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned over it, searching.
“And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he’s — ” he broke off as <PER>Neville</PER> entered the dormitory, bringing with <PER>Neville</PER> a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in <PER>Neville</PER>'s trunk for a fresh pair of pants.
Despite his determination to catch <PER>Malfoy</PER> out, <PER>Harry</PER> had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> consulted the map as often as <PER>Harry</PER> could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, <PER>Harry</PER> did not once see <PER>Malfoy</PER> anywhere suspicious.
Admittedly, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times <PER>Malfoy</PER> was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> toyed with the possibility that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how <PER>Harry</PER> could be doing it, given the very high level of security now operating within the castle.
<PER>Harry</PER> could only suppose that <PER>Harry</PER> was missing <PER>Malfoy</PER> amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map.
As for the fact that <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle appeared to be going Crabbe, and Goyle's different ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older — <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> reflected sadly, were living proof.
“Happy birthday, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast.
“Have a present.” He threw the package across onto <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed, where the package joined a small pile of them that must, <PER>Harry</PER> assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night.
“Cheers,” said <PER>Ron</PER> drowsily and, as he ripped off the paper, <PER>Harry</PER> got out of bed, opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s own trunk, and began rummaging in it for the Marauder’s Map, which <PER>Harry</PER> hid after every use.
<PER>Harry</PER> turfed out half the contents of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk before <PER>Harry</PER> found half the contents of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which <PER>Harry</PER> was still keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.
“Nice one, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper’s gloves <PER>Harry</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No problem,” said <PER>Harry</PER> absentmindedly, as <PER>Harry</PER> searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Want one?” said <PER>Ron</PER> thickly, holding out a box of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Cauldrons.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s gone again!” “Can’t have done,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as his slid out of bed to get dressed.
<PER>Harry</PER> tapped the map with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, muttered, “Mischief managed,” though it hadn’t been, and got dressed, thinking hard.
The best way of finding out would be to tail he, but even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea: <PER>Harry</PER> had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework, and Apparition; <PER>Harry</PER> could not follow <PER>Malfoy</PER> around school all day without <PER>Harry</PER>'s absence being remarked upon.
“I thought you just said — ?” “Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed <PER>Ron</PER>, “but I don’t want to eat.” <PER>Harry</PER> scrutinized him suspiciously.
“You’ve just eaten half a box of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Cauldrons, haven’t you?” “It’s not that,” <PER>Ron</PER> sighed again.
“You you wouldn’t understand.” “Fair enough,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, albeit puzzled, as <PER>Harry</PER> turned to open the door.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> suddenly.
“What?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, I can’t stand it!” “You can’t stand what?” asked “<PER>Harry</PER>, now starting to feel definitely alarmed.
<PER>Harry</PER> gaped at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not expected this and was not sure <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to hear this.
“Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, walking up to <PER>Ron</PER> to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, “okay Say that again with a straight face.” “I love her,” repeated <PER>Ron</PER> breathlessly.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s fist was drawn right back; <PER>Ron</PER>’s's face was contorted with rage; <PER>Ron</PER>’s was about to strike again.
<PER>Harry</PER> reacted instinctively; <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Levicorpus\ <PER>Ron</PER> yelled as Levicorpus\ <PER>Ron</PER>'s heel was wrenched upward once more; Levicorpus\ <PER>Ron</PER> dangled helplessly, upside down, Levicorpus\ <PER>Ron</PER>'s robes hanging off Levicorpus\ <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What’s got into — ?” And then <PER>Harry</PER> saw the box lying open on <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed, and the truth hit <PER>Harry</PER> with the force of a stampeding troll.
“Where did you get those <PER>Cho</PER>colate Cauldrons?” “They were a birthday present!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free.
But on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, <PER>Ron</PER> had not been himself when himself had attacked, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought that himself would deserve another punching if himself permitted <PER>Ron</PER> to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.
“I’m going to let you down now, okay?” <PER>Harry</PER> sent <PER>Ron</PER> crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but <PER>Ron</PER> simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.” And without another word to her, <PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s way out of the portrait hole.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but <PER>Harry</PER> answered <PER>Harry</PER>'s office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed.
“Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, somewhat distracted by the fact that <PER>Ron</PER> was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, “well, I’ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right, <PER>Ron</PER> might’ve done something serious — ” Helpfully, <PER>Ron</PER> chose this moment to moan, “I can’t see her, <PER>Harry</PER> — is he hiding her?” “Was this potion within date?” asked Slughorn, now eyeing <PER>Ron</PER> with professional interest.
“They can strengthen, you know, the longer They’re kept.” “That would explain a lot,” panted <PER>Harry</PER>, now positively wrestling with <PER>Ron</PER> to keep him from knocking Slughorn over.
“Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph — ” “<PER>Ron</PER> — ” whispered <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ — and may you have many more — ” “<PER>Ron</PER>\” <PER>Ron</PER> had dropped his glass; his half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt over a low table and sprinted toward Slughorn ’s open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of <PER>Ron</PER>’s gargling breath filled the room.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> found it — the shriveled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from <PER>Harry</PER> in Potions.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurtled back to <PER>Ron</PER>’s side, wrenched open <PER>Harry</PER>'s jaw, and thrust the bezoar into his mouth.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were sitting around him; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> had spent all day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out.
“This isn’t how we imagined handing over our present,” said George grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on <PER>Ron</PER>’s bedside cabinet and sitting beside <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“How exactly did it happen, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> retold the story <PER>Harry</PER> had already recounted, it felt like a hundred times to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to <PER>McGonagall</PER>, to Madam Pomfrey, to <PER>Hermione</PER>, and to <PER>Ginny</PER>. "
and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they brought <PER>Ron</PER> up here.
Having hurtled, white-faced, up to <PER>Harry</PER> outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened, <PER>Hermione</PER> had taken almost no part in <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s obsessive discussion about how <PER>Ron</PER> had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightened-looking, until at last them had been allowed in to see him.
“Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once; <PER>Harry</PER> at once could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again.
“Slughorn poured it out — ” “Would he have been able to slip something into <PER>Ron</PER>’s glass without you seeing?” “Probably,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but why would Slughorn want to poison <PER>Ron</PER>?” “No idea,” said Fred, frowning.
“The poison could have been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself.” “Who’d want to kill Slughorn?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> reckons <PER>Voldemort</PER> wanted Slughorn on his side,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And maybe <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants <PER>Voldemort</PER> out of the way, maybe <PER>Voldemort</PER> thinks <PER>Voldemort</PER> could be valuable to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for Christmas,” <PER>Ginny</PER> reminded him.
“So the poisoner could just as easily have been after <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Then the poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had a bad head cold.
“I don’ believe this,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at <PER>Ron</PER>.
they both had done no more than satisfy they both that <PER>Ron</PER> would make a full recovery on they both's last visit to the ward; now Molly seized hold of <PER>Harry</PER> and hugged him very tightly.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s told us how you saved <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with the bezoar,” she sobbed.
“Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when <PER>Ron</PER> decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed; he and <PER>Hermione</PER> rose at once to leave and <PER>Hagrid</PER> decided to go with them, leaving <PER>Ron</PER> with his family.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s angry with <PER>Snape</PER>?” “I never said tha’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway.
“Look at the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I need ter — ” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, why is <PER>Dumbledore</PER> angry with <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked loudly.
“What’s <PER>Snape</PER> done?” “I dunno, <PER>Harry</PER>, I shouldn’ta heard it at all!
“Well — I jus’ heard <PER>Snape</PER> sayin’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> took too much fer granted an’ maybe <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — <PER>Snape</PER> — didn’ wan’ ter do it anymore — ” “Do what?” “I dunno, <PER>Harry</PER>, it sounded like <PER>Snape</PER> was feelin’ a bit overworked, tha’s all — anyway, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told him flat out him’d agreed ter do it an’ that was all there was to it.
“All the Heads o’ Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business — ” “Yeah, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s not having rows with the rest of them, is <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I know what yeh’re like abou’ <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, an’ I don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more inter this than there is.” “Look out,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tersely.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not need telling twice; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both hurried off; <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s and Filch’s raised voices echoed behind them as them ran.
It did not seem that people knew about <PER>Ron</PER> yet; <PER>Harry</PER> was very relieved: <PER>Harry</PER> had been interrogated enough that day.
<PER>Hermione</PER> bade <PER>Harry</PER> good night and set off for the girls’ dormitory.
So <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had argued with <PER>Snape</PER>.
In spite of all he had told <PER>Harry</PER>, in spite of <PER>Harry</PER>'s insistence that <PER>Harry</PER> trusted <PER>Snape</PER> completely, <PER>Harry</PER> had lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper with him.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not think that <PER>Snape</PER> had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
Was it because <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not want <PER>Harry</PER> to do anything foolish, to take matters into <PER>Harry</PER>'s own hands, that <PER>Harry</PER> had pretended there was nothing in <PER>Harry</PER>’s suspicions?
It might even be that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not want anything to distract <PER>Harry</PER> from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from Slughorn.
Perhaps <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not think it right to confide suspicions about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s staff to sixteen- year-olds.
“There you are, Potter!” <PER>Harry</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet in shock, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the ready.
“Look, why don’t you talk to <PER>Ron</PER> about all this?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what <PER>Ron</PER> had said about her new dress robes to whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Ron</PER> considered his relationship with Lavender to be “serious.” “Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and see him!” said Lavender fretfully.
“Is he?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, surprised, for he had found <PER>Ron</PER> perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>’s row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as possible.
“Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hurriedly, and <PER>Harry</PER> dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take <PER>Harry</PER> off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let <PER>Harry</PER> go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite <PER>Harry</PER>.
“So how’s McLaggen shaping up?” he asked <PER>Harry</PER> nervously, apparently forgetting that <PER>Harry</PER> had already asked the same question twice.
“I’ve told you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> patiently, “<PER>Harry</PER> could be world-class and I wouldn’t want to keep <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s already gone down to the pitch with <PER>Ginny</PER>.” “Oh,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking rather glum.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> stopped short at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, then gave a short, humorless laugh and continued walking.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> pushed past <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s friend followed at a trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.
This was infuriating; <PER>Harry</PER> was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was <PER>Malfoy</PER>, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: <PER>Harry</PER>’s best chance yet of discovering what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was up to.
The silent seconds trickled past, and <PER>Harry</PER> remained where <PER>Harry</PER> was, frozen, gazing at the place where <PER>Malfoy</PER> had vanished.
“Where have you been?” demanded <PER>Ginny</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted into the changing rooms.
“I met <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> told her quietly, as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarlet robes over his head.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam Hooch’s whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of <PER>Harry</PER>'s team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch.
Beside Luna, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was looking slightly uncomfortable, as though Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment. "
“McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you’re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!” bellowed <PER>Harry</PER>, wheeling around to face <PER>Harry</PER>'s Keeper.
A blinding, sickening pain a flash of light distant screams and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel And the next thing <PER>Harry</PER> knew, <PER>Harry</PER> was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head awkwardly.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s head felt strangely heavy; <PER>Harry</PER>’s raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, <PER>Harry</PER>'s recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> came in to visit while you were unconscious,” he said, after a long pause, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which <PER>Ginny</PER>, weeping over <PER>Harry</PER>'s lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Ron</PER> gave them his blessing.
“Yeah well, I saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn’t look like they wanted to be with him, and that’s the second time him’s made sure him isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; him skipped the last match too, remember?” <PER>Harry</PER> sighed.
“You couldn’t have missed a Quidditch match just to follow <PER>Malfoy</PER>, you’re the Captain!” “I want to know what he’s up to,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And don’t tell me it’s all in my head, not after what I overheard between he and <PER>Snape</PER> — ” “I never said it was all in your head,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at <PER>Harry</PER>, “but there’s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place!
If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour’s power, he would have been able to set a tail upon <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but unfortunately <PER>Harry</PER> did not have an office full of Aurors at <PER>Harry</PER>'s command.
It was easiest to feign sleep; <PER>Harry</PER> rolled over onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved shis wand.
This was, <PER>Harry</PER> reflected in the darkness, the third time that <PER>Harry</PER> had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury.
Last time <PER>Harry</PER> had fallen off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch, and the time before that, all the bones had been removed from <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm by the incurably inept Professor Lockhart.
That had been his most painful injury by far his remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the — <PER>Harry</PER> sat bolt upright, the — <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart pounding, the — <PER>Harry</PER>'s bandage turban askew.
“What’s going — ?” <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey’s office and muttered, “MuffliatoV’ so that Madam Pomfrey’s would not come running.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both leapt out of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both's beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both continued to try and kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squealing, “Stick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies — ” <PER>Harry</PER> aimed his wand at Peeves and said, “Langlockl” Peeves clutched at Langlockl's throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that Langlockl's tongue had just glued itself to the roof of Langlockl's mouth.
“Okay then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.
“Master called me?” croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he gave <PER>Harry</PER> a look that plainly wished <PER>Harry</PER> a painful death.
“I’ve got a job for you.” “Kreacher will do whatever Master wants,” said Kreacher, sinking so low that Master's lips almost touched Master's gnarled toes, “because Kreacher has no choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes “Dobby will do it, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” squeaked Dobby, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!
“Dobby would be honored to help <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” “Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Okay then I want you to tail <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.” Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face, <PER>Harry</PER> went on, “I want to know where <PER>Harry</PER>’s going, who <PER>Harry</PER>’s meeting, and what <PER>Harry</PER>’s doing.
“And if Dobby does it wrong, Dobby will throw Dobby off the topmost tower, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” “There won’t be any need for that,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily.
After a moment or two, and to <PER>Harry</PER>’s great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and said, with bitter resentment, “Master thinks of everything, and Kreacher must obey “Master even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy, oh yes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s the news that <PER>Ginny</PER> had argued with Dean.
The drowsing creature in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest suddenly raised The drowsing creature in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest head, sniffing the air hopefully.
“It’s all right!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> kindly, hurrying forward to help <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Here ” <PER>Hermione</PER> tapped the broken scales with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand and said, “Reparo.” The girl did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; <PER>Ron</PER> glanced back at The girl.
“What did <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean row about, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadn’t caught <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> could have been very badly hurt!” “Yeah, well, there was no need for <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean to split up over it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still trying to sound casual.
“Or are they still together?” “Yes, they are — but why are you so interested?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, giving <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> a sharp look.
“I just don’t want my Quidditch team messed up again!” he said hastily, but <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, “<PER>Harry</PER>!” giving “<PER>Harry</PER> an excuse to turn “<PER>Harry</PER>'s back on her.
I’ve been told to give you this.” It was a small roll of parchment, which <PER>Harry</PER> recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Tonight,” he told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, once he had unrolled it.
“C’mon,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Hermione</PER>, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, “Why didn’t you tell me you were getting out today?
<PER>Hermione</PER> was acting as though <PER>Hermione</PER> was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> saw an inexplicable smirk cross <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
All that day <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room <PER>Hermione</PER> even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) <PER>Harry</PER>’s Herbology essay, something <PER>Hermione</PER> had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because <PER>Hermione</PER> had known that <PER>Harry</PER> would then let <PER>Ron</PER> copy his work.
“Thanks a lot, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o’clock.
“Enter,” called <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but as <PER>Harry</PER> put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside.
“Aha!” she cried, pointing dramatically at <PER>Harry</PER> as she blinked at <PER>Harry</PER> through shis magnifying spectacles.
“So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “My dear Sybill,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in a slightly exasperated voice, “there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but <PER>Harry</PER> does have an appointment, and I really don’t think there is any more to be said — ” “Very well,” said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice.
“Please close the door and sit down, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sounding rather tired.
<PER>Harry</PER> obeyed, noticing as <PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual seat in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory.
What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and <PER>Ron</PER> being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was up to, <PER>Harry</PER> had almost forgotten about the memory <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had asked <PER>Harry</PER> to extract from Professor Slughorn.
“I see,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> eventually, peering at <PER>Harry</PER> over the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s half-moon spectacles and giving <PER>Harry</PER> the usual sensation that <PER>Harry</PER> was being X-rayed.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s voice, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not even sound angry, but <PER>Harry</PER> would have preferred <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything.
“Sir,” Sir said, a little desperately, “it isn’t that I wasn’t bothered or anything, I’ve just had other — other things ” “Other things on your mind,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> finished the sentence for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I see.” Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence <PER>Harry</PER> had ever experienced with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt strangely diminished, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had shrunk a little since <PER>Harry</PER> had entered the room.
When <PER>Harry</PER> could stand it no longer <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I’m really sorry.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> killed <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s father and <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it.
“Now, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?” “Yes, sir.” “Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what <PER>Voldemort</PER> did until the age of seventeen?” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
“But now, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “now things become murkier and stranger.
“I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.” The idea that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> valued <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s opinion this highly made <PER>Harry</PER> feel even more deeply ashamed that <PER>Harry</PER> had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and <PER>Harry</PER> shifted guiltily in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it.
“Firstly, and very importantly, <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, I believe, more attached to this school than <PER>Voldemort</PER> has ever been to a person.
“And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tapped a bottle with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand, the cork flew out, and wand tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as wand did so, “After you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until <PER>Harry</PER>'s face touched them.
<PER>Harry</PER> could only assume that it was down in Hokey’s contract that she must lie through shis teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in <PER>Harry</PER>'s opinion.
The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man <PER>Harry</PER> had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw a red gleam in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dark eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah’s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s handsome features.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> reached out <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Voldemort</PER> was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.
“So there you are, Tom, dear, and I hope you enjoyed that!” She looked <PER>Voldemort</PER> full in the face and for the first time, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Shis foolish smile falter.
“Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, resuming <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s seat and indicating that <PER>Harry</PER> should do the same.
“It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused — ” “<PER>Voldemort</PER> modified shis memory, just like he did with Morfin!” “Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society <PER>Hermione</PER> had set up, S.P.E.W.
“I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, <PER>Harry</PER>, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that him saw the locket, at least, as rightfully him.” “The locket maybe,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but why take the cup as well?” “It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
And <PER>Harry</PER> dived after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office <PER>Harry</PER> had just left.
There was Fawkes slumbering happily on Fawkes's perch, and there behind the desk was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who looked very similar to the <PER>Dumbledore</PER> standing beside <PER>Harry</PER>, though both hands were whole and undamaged and <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was, perhaps, a little less lined.
The younger <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and The younger <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “Enter.” <PER>Harry</PER> let out a hastily stifled gasp.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> features were not those <PER>Harry</PER> had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet <PER>Voldemort</PER> was no longer handsome Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was wearing a long black cloak, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was as pale as the snow glistening on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders.
“Won’t you sit down?” “Thank you,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> took the seat to which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had gestured — the very seat, by the looks of it, that <PER>Harry</PER> had just vacated in the present.
“I have come a long way.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood and swept over to the cabinet where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> now kept the Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles.
Having handed <PER>Voldemort</PER> a goblet of wine and poured one for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned to the seat behind <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s desk.
“So, Tom to what do I owe the pleasure?<PER>Voldemort</PER> did not answer at once, but merely sipped <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wine.
Nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER> felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s refusal to use <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s chosen name was a refusal to allow <PER>Voldemort</PER> to dictate the terms of the meeting, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Voldemort</PER> took it as such.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for <PER>Voldemort</PER> to talk first.
“Certainly,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s eyes seemed to burn red.
“I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed — ” “Of some kinds of magic,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> corrected <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
“But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,” suggested <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“You are omniscient as ever, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lightly.
“Now, Tom ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> set down Tom ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s empty glass and drew Tom ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> up in Tom ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s seat, the tips of Tom ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fingers together in a very characteristic gesture.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s hand close over <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm again and moments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s hand was blackened and dead-looking once more.
“Why?” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, looking up into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s face.
“When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear to both of us.” <PER>Harry</PER> was still burning with curiosity and even though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had walked to the door and was holding it open for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not move at once.
“Don’t start, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“If it hadn’t been for the Prince, <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn’t be sitting here now.” “He would if you’d just listened to <PER>Snape</PER> in our first year,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> dismissively.
<PER>Harry</PER> ignored <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just found an incantation (“ Sectumsempral”) scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words “For Enemies,” and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but <PER>Harry</PER>, who would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the test whether ready or not.
Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, <PER>Ron</PER> was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for <PER>Snape</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already completed.
<PER>Harry</PER> fully expected to receive low marks on <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Harry</PER> had disagreed with <PER>Snape</PER> on the best way to tackle dementors, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not care: Slughorn’s memory was the most important thing to <PER>Harry</PER> now.
‘Tm telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help you with this, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, more loudly.
“It can’t be B — U — M — ” “No, it isn’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling <PER>Ron</PER>’s essay toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Don’t say I’ll have to write the whole thing out again!” “It’s okay, we can fix it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling the essay toward <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and taking out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand.
“I love you, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t let Lavender hear you saying that.” “I won’t,” said <PER>Ron</PER> into his hands.
“You and <PER>Cho</PER> just — ” “Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> “Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” said <PER>Ron</PER> gloomily, watching <PER>Hermione</PER> silently tapping each of <PER>Harry</PER>'s misspelled words with the end of <PER>Cho</PER>'s wand, so that they corrected they on the page.
“Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion?” <PER>Harry</PER>, who had found nothing useful in the Half- Blood Prince’s notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>'s essay.
The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and <PER>Ron</PER> scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using <PER>Hermione</PER>’s quill.
<PER>Hermione</PER> let out a little shriek; <PER>Ron</PER> spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Kreacher!” The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes.
“Dobby has been helping too, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!
“And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see <PER>Harry</PER> Potter so they can make their reports together!” “What is this?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances.
“What’s going on, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated before answering, because <PER>Harry</PER> had not told <PER>Hermione</PER> about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail <PER>Malfoy</PER>; house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her.
“Dobby has not slept for a week, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” said Dobby proudly, swaying where <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!
“Master <PER>Malfoy</PER> moves with a nobility that befits Master <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s pure blood,” croaked Kreacher at once.
“His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of — ” “<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> is a bad boy!” squeaked Dobby angrily.
“Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.” Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master <PER>Malfoy</PER> eats in the Great Hall, “Master <PER>Malfoy</PER> sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, “Master <PER>Malfoy</PER> attends “Master <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s classes in a variety of — ” “Dobby, you tell me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, cutting across Kreacher.
“Has he been going anywhere he shouldn’t have?” “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, “the <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but the <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy is still keen to avoid detection.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at him.
“If you need it to be Unplottable, it will be.” “Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s doing?” said <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> got into our headquarters there last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.” “But I don’t think you will, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> slowly.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t “<PER>Malfoy</PER>, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed.
“You’ve done brilliantly, Dobby.” “Kreacher’s done well too,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> kindly; but far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted Kreacher's huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, “The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear — ” “Get out of it,” <PER>Harry</PER> snapped at <PER>Harry</PER>, and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated.
“You’d better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.” “Thank you, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir!” squeaked Dobby happily, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter too vanished.
“How good’s this?” said <PER>Harry</PER> enthusiastically, turning to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the moment the room was elf-free again.
<PER>Hermione</PER> pulled it toward <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and began siphoning the ink off with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand.
“Hmmm the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> skeptically, rolling up <PER>Ron</PER>’s dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.
“Yes, we will,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, getting to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet and stretching.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how <PER>Malfoy</PER> was using the Room of Requirement and what <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, would see when <PER>Harry</PER> went in there the following day, for whatever <PER>Hermione</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that if <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been able to see the headquarters of the D.A., <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to see <PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s what could it be?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s mind worked feverishly and <PER>Harry</PER>'s dreams, when <PER>Harry</PER> finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who turned into Slughorn, who turned into <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning; <PER>Harry</PER> had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in <PER>Harry</PER>'s whispered plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Hermione</PER> might be a lot of help if <PER>Hermione</PER> wanted to.
“I haven’t forgotten about Slughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldn’t I find out what <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s doing?” “I’ve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Yes!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, causing both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to gag on their breakfast.
<PER>Hermione</PER> set off immediately for Ancient Runes; <PER>Ron</PER> for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on <PER>Snape</PER>’s dementor essay; and <PER>Harry</PER> for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak once <PER>Harry</PER> had found an empty passage, but <PER>Harry</PER> need not have bothered.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached <PER>Harry</PER>'s destination <PER>Harry</PER> found it deserted.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure whether <PER>Harry</PER>'s chances of getting inside the room were better with <PER>Malfoy</PER> inside it or out, but at least <PER>Harry</PER>'s first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl.
I need you to become the place you become for <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> did not immediately open <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes when <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had finished <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s patrolling; <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was listening hard, as though <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> might hear the door pop into existence.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds outside.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> opened <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried every variation of “I need to see what <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> is doing inside you” that <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was forced to concede that <PER>Hermione</PER> might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Frustrated and annoyed, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak and stuffing Invisibility Cloak into <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s bag as he went.
“Late again, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, as <PER>Harry</PER> hurried into the candlelit classroom.
“Ten points from Gryffindor.” <PER>Harry</PER> scowled at <PER>Snape</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> flung himself into the seat beside <PER>Ron</PER>; half the class was still on its feet, taking out books and organizing their things; himself could not be much later than any of them.
“But sir, I heard people talking — ” “If you had actually read the article in question, Mister Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.” “I thought <PER>Snape</PER> and Mundungus were on the same side,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest “But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, Potter's black eyes fixed on <PER>Harry</PER> “Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.” The whole class looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, who hastily tried to recall what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn.
<PER>Harry</PER> took a deep breath and continued calmly, though <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides were boiling, “Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren’t they?
“I would expect nothing more sophisticated from you, <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.” “IVo!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, grabbing <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm as <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth furiously.
When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> (<PER>Hermione</PER> mysteriously melted out of sight as <PER>Hermione</PER> approached) and abused <PER>Snape</PER> hotly for <PER>Snape</PER>'s jibe about <PER>Ron</PER>’s Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER> shook her off by making a detour into the boys’ bathroom with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s right, though, isn’t he?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two.
“You’re right,” he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, “I’ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.” And so the following weekend, <PER>Ron</PER> joined <PER>Hermione</PER> and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; <PER>Harry</PER> missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time.
“You’d do better,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, when he confided this plan to <PER>Ron</PER> and her in the entrance hall, “to go straight to Slughorn’s office and try and get that memory from him.” “I’ve been trying!” said <PER>Harry</PER> crossly, which was perfectly true.
<PER>Harry</PER> had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> had not been able to catch <PER>Harry</PER>.
Twice, <PER>Harry</PER> had gone to <PER>Harry</PER>'s office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone.
“<PER>Harry</PER> doesn’t want to talk to me, <PER>Hermione</PER>!
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever <PER>Hermione</PER> said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement.
Once out of sight of the entrance hall, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Marauder’s Map and <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak from his bag.
Laughing, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance.
It gave <PER>Harry</PER> a most agreeable feeling of power as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to remember what form of words <PER>Harry</PER> had not yet tried.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt frustrated beyond belief; <PER>Malfoy</PER> might be just feet away from <PER>Harry</PER>, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing in there.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> might have broken <PER>Harry</PER>'s toe; as <PER>Harry</PER> clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
“You haven’t had any letters from anyone in the Order recently?” “No one from the Order writes to me anymore,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “not since Sirius — ” <PER>Harry</PER> saw that her eyes had filled with tears.
“Well I’ll see you around, <PER>Harry</PER> ” And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to stare after she.
After a minute or so, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed <PER>Harry</PER>'s efforts to get into the Room of Requirement, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was not in it.
Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would soon be back for lunch made his abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to <PER>Malfoy</PER> who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.
He found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.
“I did it — well, kind of!” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> enthusiastically when he caught sight of him.
“How’d you do, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer.
“Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should’ve heard Twycross going on about Twycross's — I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t pop the question soon — ” “And what about you?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
“She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she suddenly abandoning shis post to come and see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when he’s not even here?” “I had a thought,” said <PER>Harry</PER> tentatively.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt strange about voicing it; this was much more <PER>Hermione</PER>’s territory than <PER>Harry</PER>.
“For the last time, just forget about <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> firmly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet — Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them — for Them were taking Them's tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves.
<PER>Ron</PER> gave a start and tried to hide behind <PER>Hermione</PER> as a girl came around the corner.
Once the girl was out of earshot he said, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said we wouldn’t be having any more lessons until I got the memory!” “Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?” suggested <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> unrolled the parchment; but rather than finding <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run.
Dear <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, Aragog died last night <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, you met <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, and you know how special <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> was.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, I know you’d have liked <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> “Look at this,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, handing the note to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you can’t be thinking of going,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I s’pose <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’ll have to bury Aragog without us.” “Yes, he will,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking relieved.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, that’s it — get lucky!” “What d’you mean?” “Use your lucky potion!” “<PER>Ron</PER>, that’s — that’s it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding stunned.
“What on earth is more important than this memory, <PER>Harry</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of <PER>Harry</PER>'s imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved <PER>Ginny</PER> splitting up with Dean, and <PER>Ron</PER> somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of Dean's brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking .
“Oh, stop that,” <PER>Ron</PER> begged she, “I feel sick enough as it is — quick, hide me!” “It isn’t Lavender!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> impatiently, as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and <PER>Ron</PER> dived behind <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Cool,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, peering over <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder to check.
“Good luck.” “And you too!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a significant look, as <PER>Harry</PER> headed off to the dungeons.
There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: <PER>Harry</PER>, Ernie, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Undoubtedly, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, watching <PER>Harry</PER> over the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own book, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was begrudging the time <PER>Harry</PER> could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement.
Cheered by this thought, <PER>Harry</PER> skimmed through <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Advanced Potion-Making and found a heavily corrected Half-Blood Prince’s version of “An Elixir to Induce Euphoria,” which seemed not only to meet Slughorn ’s instructions, but which might (<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn into such a good mood that <PER>Harry</PER> would be prepared to hand over that memory if <PER>Harry</PER> could persuade <PER>Harry</PER> to taste some.
Ernie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine <PER>Harry</PER> for once, <PER>Harry</PER> had most rashly invented <PER>Harry</PER>'s own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely “passable.” The bell rang and both Ernie and <PER>Malfoy</PER> left at once.
“Sir,” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder; when <PER>Harry</PER> saw that the room was empty but for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried away as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
Disappointed, <PER>Harry</PER> emptied the cauldron, packed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> returned in the late afternoon.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” cried <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed through the portrait hole.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I passed!” “Well done!” <PER>Harry</PER>!” said.
“And <PER>Ron</PER>?” “He — He just failed,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ron</PER> came slouching into the room looking most morose.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER> — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded.
<PER>Harry</PER> took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle.
“Well, here goes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> raised the little bottle and took a carefully measured gulp.
Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> could have done anything, anything at all and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, smiling, brimming with confidence.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER> — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m going to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, I’ve got a good feeling about going to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.” “You’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, looking stunned.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak out of Invisibility Cloak's bag.
“I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?” “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, both looking positively alarmed now.
“You haven’t got another little bottle full of — I don’t know “Essence of Insanity?” suggested <PER>Ron</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> swung his cloak over his shoulders.
<PER>Harry</PER> laughed, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked even more alarmed.
“I know what I’m doing or at least” — he strolled confidently to the door — “Felix does.” he pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hurrying along behind him.
“What were you doing up there with her?” shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through <PER>Harry</PER> at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> emerging together from the boys’ dormitories.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them.
Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean came through it, and <PER>Harry</PER> was able to slip between <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not have to creep along, for <PER>Harry</PER> met nobody on <PER>Harry</PER>'s way, but this did not surprise <PER>Harry</PER> in the slightest: This evening, <PER>Harry</PER> was the luckiest person at Hogwarts.
Why <PER>Harry</PER> knew that going to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s was the right thing to do, <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea.
It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time: <PER>Harry</PER> could not see the final destination, <PER>Harry</PER> could not see where Slughorn came in, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was going the right way to get that memory.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the entrance hall <PER>Harry</PER> saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door.
It was when <PER>Harry</PER> reached the bottom step that it occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on <PER>Harry</PER>'s walk to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to <PER>Harry</PER> that this was a whim on which <PER>Harry</PER> should act, so <PER>Harry</PER> directed <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout.
“Good evening, Professor.” “Merlin’s beard, <PER>Harry</PER>, you made me jump,” said Slughorn, stopping dead in <PER>Harry</PER>'s tracks and looking wary.
“But I know that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts <PER>Hagrid</PER> to the hilt, so I’m sure he can’t be up to anything very dreadful.
“Well,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, with a most convincing hesitancy, “well, if you wanted to come, Professor, <PER>Hagrid</PER> would probably be really pleased.
“Yeh came,” croaked <PER>Hagrid</PER>, when Yeh opened the door and saw <PER>Harry</PER> emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yeah — <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> couldn’t, though,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of <PER>Hagrid</PER> he could easily reach.
“Are we going to bury him here, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, in your garden?” “Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> in a choked voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak, though <PER>Hagrid</PER>, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing.
“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,” said Slughorn, who like <PER>Harry</PER> could reach no higher than <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s elbow, but patted it all the same.
“Why don’t I say a few words?” He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as <PER>Harry</PER> stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, “Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t forget!
“I have had it all tested for poison,” he assured <PER>Harry</PER>, pouring most of the first bottle into one of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s bucket- sized mugs and handing it to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.” <PER>Harry</PER> saw, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind’s eye, the expression on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s face if <PER>Hermione</PER> ever heard about this abuse of house-elves, and decided never to mention it to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Well” — he raised his mug high — “to Aragog.” “Aragog,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> together.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, with the way ahead illuminated for <PER>Harry</PER> by Felix Felicis, knew that <PER>Harry</PER> must not drink, so <PER>Harry</PER> merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until well ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face darkened and <PER>Harry</PER> knew why: Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> had contrived to have <PER>Hagrid</PER> thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets.
“That’s never unicorn hair, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “Oh, yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> indifferently.
“It’s dead useful very strong, see.” Slughorn took another deep draught from Slughorn's mug, his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, for more treasures that <PER>Harry</PER> might be able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak- matured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smoking jackets.
<PER>Harry</PER> refilled <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s mug and <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, and questioned <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how <PER>Hagrid</PER> was able to look after them all.
The Felix Felicis gave <PER>Harry</PER> a little nudge at this point, and <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that <PER>Harry</PER> might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, <PER>Harry</PER> grinned to <PER>Harry</PER> as, unnoticed by either <PER>Hagrid</PER> or Slughorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.
After an hour or so, <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to elf-made wine, and to — “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, slopping some of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!”'s fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it.
“Me dad was no age ter go nor were yer mum an’ dad, <PER>Harry</PER>” Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s crinkled eyes again; <PER>Harry</PER> grasped <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and shook <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
“Can’t carry a tune to save my life.” “<PER>Hagrid</PER> wasn’t talking about your singing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s heavy snores.
“Yeah <PER>Voldemort</PER> murdered him and then stepped over him's body toward my mum,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Really, my dear boy, enough I’m an old man I don’t need to hear I don’t want to hear “I forgot,” lied <PER>Harry</PER>, Felix Felicis leading <PER>Harry</PER> on.
“You are the <PER>Cho</PER>sen One?” “Of course I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER> calmly.
“But then my dear boy you’re asking a great deal you’re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy — ” “You don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, of course I do, but — ” “You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?” Slughorn said nothing; Slughorn looked terrified.
Then, very slowly, Slughorn put <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s other hand inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak and took out a small, empty bottle.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as <PER>Harry</PER> crept back into the castle.
The front door had remained unlocked for <PER>Harry</PER>, but on the third floor <PER>Harry</PER> met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s shortcuts.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> returned to the school an hour ago.” Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward <PER>Harry</PER>, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff.
“him appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.” “Where is he?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart leaping.
“I believe, from what the Baron said, that the Baron had business to attend to before turning in — ” “Yeah, he has,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling <PER>Dumbledore</PER> he had secured the memory.
“Enter,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> knocked.
“Good gracious, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in surprise.
“And now,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, placing the stone basin upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> landed beside <PER>Harry</PER> just as <PER>Riddle</PER> asked, “Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?” “Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at <PER>Riddle</PER>, though winking at the same time.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Harry</PER> was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to <PER>Harry</PER> as their leader.
His voice was carefully controlled, but <PER>Harry</PER> could sense <PER>Harry</PER>'s excitement.
“Thank you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat too and waited for <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to speak.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard.
“You heard <PER>Voldemort</PER>: What <PER>Voldemort</PER> particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes.
“The diary, <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.” “I don’t understand, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But don’t you see, <PER>Harry</PER>, that if <PER>Harry</PER> intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, <PER>Harry</PER> was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of <PER>Harry</PER>'s soul concealed within it.
“Why couldn’t <PER>Harry</PER> make a Sorcerer’s Stone, or steal one, if <PER>Harry</PER> was so interested in immortality?” “Well, we know that <PER>Harry</PER> tried to do just that, five years ago,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I think you have earned that right.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart lift.
The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s decision; <PER>Harry</PER> saw a few of them shaking them's heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted.
“I can love!” It was only with difficulty that he stopped he adding, “Big deal!” “Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>, you can love,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what <PER>Harry</PER> had just refrained from saying.
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because <PER>Voldemort</PER> made it so.
Pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s black, withered hand, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “You are setting too much store by the prophecy!” “But,” spluttered <PER>Harry</PER>, “but you said the prophecy means — ” “If <PER>Voldemort</PER> had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled?
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> killed my mum and dad!” “You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> loudly.
“Yes.” But he understood at last what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been trying to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew — and so do I, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world.
Exhausted but delighted with <PER>Harry</PER>'s night’s work, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> everything that had happened during next morning’s Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them).
They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told They about <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s Horcruxes and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s promise to take <PER>Harry</PER> along, should he find another one.
“Wow,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> had finally finished telling them everything; <PER>Ron</PER> was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing.
Lavender Brown, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, glared at <PER>Hermione</PER> from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and <PER>Hermione</PER> immediately let go of <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm.
“We split up,” he told <PER>Harry</PER> out of the corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
“It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn’t have to finish it.” “Coward,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> looked amused.
“If <PER>Ginny</PER> and Dean aren’t speaking ” “Oh — oh yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and <PER>Hermione</PER> was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s were still murky brown.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s vinegar turned to ice; <PER>Ron</PER>’s flask exploded.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed cheery too, though when asked what <PER>Hermione</PER> was grinning about <PER>Hermione</PER> simply said, “It’s a nice day.” Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s brain: She’s <PER>Ron</PER>’s sister.
He’s your best mate\ <PER>Harry</PER> barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until <PER>Hermione</PER> cried, “Katie!
“So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “to be in the ladies’ bathroom.” “Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “and have a go at the Room of Requirement again.” “That would be a complete waste of potion,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> flatly, putting down the copy of Spellman’s Syllabary <PER>Hermione</PER> had just taken out of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was about to put <PER>Harry</PER>'s book away again when <PER>Harry</PER> noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned “For Enemies,” that he had marked a few weeks previously.
he took the blow stoically enough when <PER>Harry</PER> told he, merely grunting and shrugging, but <PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct feeling as <PER>Harry</PER> walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
<PER>Ginny</PER> did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, <PER>Ginny</PER> was the life and soul of the team.
<PER>Ginny</PER> imitations of <PER>Ron</PER> anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of <PER>Harry</PER> bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused.
<PER>Harry</PER>, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at <PER>Ginny</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because <PER>Harry</PER> had not been keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes on the Snitch.
The battle still raged inside his head: <PER>Ginny</PER> or <PER>Ron</PER>?
Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender <PER>Ron</PER> might not mind too much if the post-Lavender <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Ginny</PER> out, but then the post-Lavender <PER>Ron</PER> remembered <PER>Ron</PER>’s expression when the post-Lavender <PER>Ron</PER> had seen <PER>Ginny</PER>'s kissing Dean, and was sure that <PER>Ron</PER> would consider it base treachery if <PER>Harry</PER> so much as held her hand.
Yet <PER>Harry</PER> could not help <PER>Harry</PER> talking to <PER>Ginny</PER>, laughing with <PER>Ginny</PER>, walking back from practice with <PER>Ginny</PER>; however much <PER>Harry</PER>'s conscience ached, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> wondering how best to get <PER>Ginny</PER>'s on <PER>Ginny</PER>'s own.
Once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> considered asking for <PER>Hermione</PER>’s help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when <PER>Hermione</PER> spotted he staring at <PER>Ginny</PER> or laughing at her jokes.
And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask <PER>Ginny</PER> out soon: he and <PER>Ron</PER> were at least agreed on the fact that <PER>Ginny</PER> was too popular for <PER>Ginny</PER>'s own good.
The balmy days slid gently through May, and <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to be there at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder every time <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause <PER>Ron</PER> to realize that nothing would make <PER>Harry</PER> happier than <PER>Harry</PER>'s best friend and <PER>Harry</PER>'s sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds.
There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; <PER>Ron</PER> wanted to talk tactics with <PER>Harry</PER> all the time and had little thought for anything else.
If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, would ever, ever let <PER>Harry</PER> forget that it had been <PER>Harry</PER> who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries.
Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind with success or failure in <PER>Harry</PER>'s plans for <PER>Ginny</PER>.
In the midst of all his preoccupations, <PER>Harry</PER> had not forgotten <PER>Harry</PER>'s other ambition: finding out what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was up to in the Room of Requirement.
He was still checking the Marauder’s Map, and as He was unable to locate <PER>Malfoy</PER> on it, deduced that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was still spending plenty of time within the room.
Although <PER>Harry</PER> was losing hope that <PER>Harry</PER> would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, <PER>Harry</PER> attempted it whenever <PER>Harry</PER> was in the vicinity, but no matter how <PER>Harry</PER> reworded <PER>Harry</PER>'s request, the wall remained firmly doorless.
A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> walking down to dinner alone from the common room, <PER>Ron</PER> having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and <PER>Hermione</PER> having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake <PER>Hermione</PER> thought <PER>Hermione</PER> might have made in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s last Arithmancy essay.
More out of habit than anything, <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder’s Map as <PER>Harry</PER> went.
For a moment he could not find <PER>Malfoy</PER> anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys’ bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle.
<PER>Harry</PER> only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when <PER>Harry</PER> walked right into a suit of armor.
The loud crash brought <PER>Harry</PER> out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, <PER>Harry</PER> dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below.
Outside the bathroom, <PER>Harry</PER> pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear against the door.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing with <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s back to the door, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hands clutching either side of the sink, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s white- blond head bowed.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw <PER>Harry</PER> staring at <PER>Harry</PER> over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> wheeled around, drawing <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand.
Instinctively, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hex missed <PER>Harry</PER> by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> sideways, thought Levicorpus\ and flicked <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> blocked the jinx and raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand for another — “No!
Slipping and staggering, <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and plunged toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood- soaked chest.
“No — I didn’t — ” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying; <PER>Harry</PER> fell to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees beside <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own blood.
<PER>Snape</PER> stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Go,” <PER>Snape</PER> said to Myrtle, and <PER>Snape</PER> swooped back into <PER>Snape</PER>'s toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Snape</PER> was going to do and <PER>Harry</PER> had never been able to prevent it.
The bathroom seemed to shimmer before <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes; <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to block out all thought, but try as <PER>Harry</PER> might, the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making swam hazily to the forefront of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> was staring at <PER>Snape</PER> again, in the midst of this wrecked, soaked bathroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared into <PER>Snape</PER>’s black eyes, hoping against hope that <PER>Snape</PER> had not seen what <PER>Snape</PER> feared, but — “Bring me your schoolbag,” said <PER>Snape</PER> softly, “and all of your schoolbooks.
Most people were walking the other way; Most people gaped at <PER>Harry</PER>, drenched in water and blood, but <PER>Harry</PER> answered none of the questions fired at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> ran past.
Would <PER>Snape</PER> tell Slughorn — <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach churned — how <PER>Harry</PER> had been achieving such good results in Potions all year?
Would <PER>Harry</PER> confiscate or destroy the book that had taught <PER>Harry</PER> so much the book that had become a kind of guide and friend?
<PER>Harry</PER> wrenched it open, flung <PER>Harry</PER> inside, and slammed it shut.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused for a moment, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter.
Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, <PER>Harry</PER> stood the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statue’s head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where <PER>Harry</PER> slammed the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and it turned at once back into stone.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming <PER>Ron</PER>’s copy of Advanced Potion- Making into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag as <PER>Harry</PER> did so.
A minute later, he was back in front of <PER>Snape</PER>, who held out his hand wordlessly for <PER>Harry</PER>’s schoolbag.
<PER>Harry</PER> handed it over, panting, a searing pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest, and waited.
One by one, <PER>Snape</PER> extracted <PER>Harry</PER>’s books and examined them.
“Then why,” asked <PER>Snape</PER>, “does it have the name ‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front cover?” <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart missed a beat.
“Poor Gryffindor fourth place this year, I fear ” And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than <PER>Ron</PER> had ever felt in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
“Leave it, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never made it to dinner; <PER>Harry</PER> had no appetite at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just finished telling <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need.
The news had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken The news upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story; <PER>Malfoy</PER> had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying <PER>Harry</PER> far and wide, and <PER>Snape</PER> had told the staff precisely what had happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who had told <PER>Harry</PER> he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly <PER>Snape</PER> ’s punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term.
“I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, evidently unable to stop <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was having a bad enough time without <PER>Hermione</PER> lecturing <PER>Harry</PER>; the looks on the Gryffindor team’s faces when He had told them He would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “how can you still stick up for that book when that spell — ” “Will you stop harping on about that book!” snapped <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Give it a rest, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was so amazed, so grateful, <PER>Harry</PER> looked up.
“By the sound of it, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad <PER>Harry</PER> had something good up <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleeve!” “Well, of course I’m glad <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t cursed!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, clearly stung.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked nervously at <PER>Harry</PER>, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind a book.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, little though <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening.
By Saturday morning, whatever himself might have told <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and the others.
“Ah, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> had knocked on <PER>Harry</PER>'s door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that <PER>Snape</PER>, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls.
It was, as <PER>Harry</PER> had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as <PER>Snape</PER> had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant <PER>Harry</PER> had just read <PER>Harry</PER>'s father or Sirius’s names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.
And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have just started <PER>Ginny</PER> playing Seeker against <PER>Cho</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall.
<PER>Snape</PER>, who had not spoken at all since setting <PER>Harry</PER> his task, finally looked up at ten past one.
<PER>Harry</PER> gaped as people began to scream at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>; several hands pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into the room.
“We won!” yelled <PER>Ron</PER>, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over the top of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in Dean Thomas's hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was beaming, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes sought <PER>Ron</PER>.
For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then <PER>Ron</PER> gave a tiny jerk of the head that <PER>Harry</PER> understood to mean, Well — if you must.
The fact that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter was going out with <PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks.
After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making <PER>Harry</PER> happier than <PER>Harry</PER> could remember being for a very long time, rather than because <PER>Harry</PER> had been involved in horrific scenes of Dark Magic.
“You’d think people had better things to gossip about,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, as <PER>Ginny</PER> sat on the common room floor, leaning against <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs and reading the Daily Prophet “Three dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both roared with laughter.
“And what did you tell her <PER>Ron</PER>’s got?” “A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.” <PER>Ron</PER> scowled as <PER>Hermione</PER> rolled around laughing.
“Watch it,” he said, pointing warningly at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
But <PER>Ron</PER>’s tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s time together was becoming increasingly restricted.
<PER>Ginny</PER>’s O.W.L.s were approaching and <PER>Ginny</PER> was therefore forced to study for hours into the night.
On one such evening, when <PER>Ginny</PER> had retired to the library, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing <PER>Harry</PER>'s Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with <PER>Ginny</PER> at lunchtime, <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped into the seat between him and <PER>Ron</PER> with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.
“I want to talk to you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “What about?” said <PER>Harry</PER> suspiciously.
Only the previous day, <PER>Hermione</PER> had told him off for distracting <PER>Ginny</PER> when <PER>Hermione</PER> ought to be working hard for <PER>Hermione</PER>'s examinations.
“Will you please drop it?” He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve He's book, and He's performance in Potions was suffering accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of <PER>Ginny</PER>, had jocularly attributed this to <PER>Harry</PER> being lovesick).
But <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that <PER>Snape</PER> had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Prince’s book, and was determined to leave it where it was while <PER>Snape</PER> remained on the lookout.
“Prince, <PER>Hermione</PER>, PrinceV’ “Right!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, red patches blazing in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cheeks as <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And the first place I’ll look,” <PER>Hermione</PER> shot at him, as <PER>Hermione</PER> reached the portrait hole, “is records of old Potions awards!” <PER>Harry</PER> scowled after her for a moment, then continued <PER>Harry</PER>'s contemplation of the darkening sky.
“Thanks to <PER>Snape</PER> ” “You still got detention with <PER>Snape</PER> this Saturday?” <PER>Ron</PER> continued.
“And <PER>Harry</PER>’s hinting now that if I don’t get all the boxes done by the end of term, we’ll carry on next year.” he was finding these detentions particularly irksome because these detentions cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether <PER>Snape</PER> did not know this, for he was keeping <PER>Harry</PER> later and later every time, while making pointed asides about <PER>Harry</PER> having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.
<PER>Harry</PER> was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at <PER>Harry</PER>'s side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment.
“Thanks, Jimmy Hey, it’s from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning the parchment.
“You don’t reckon he hasn’t found ?” “Better go and see, hadn’t I?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, jumping to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
he hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at <PER>Harry</PER> in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged <PER>Harry</PER>’s defensive jinx.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped in <PER>Harry</PER>'s tracks, listening.
“How — dare — you — aaaaargh!” The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted toward The noise, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the ready, hurtled around another corner, and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, Professor Trelawney's head covered in one of Professor Trelawney's many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken.
“The Inner Eye,” said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, “was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily; <PER>Harry</PER> had heard about Professor Trelawney’s Inner Eye all too often before.
“I think you’d better tell Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m going to see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> right now,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You were never much of a Seer but you were a wonderful Object <PER>Harry</PER> did not reply; a wonderful Object <PER>Harry</PER> had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawney’s continual predictions of doom.
but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus <PER>Snape</PER>!” “What?” “Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with <PER>Snape</PER>, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I’m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips!
<PER>Harry</PER> was standing stock- still as waves of shock crashed over <PER>Harry</PER>, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from <PER>Harry</PER> for so long .
It was <PER>Snape</PER> who had carried the news of the prophecy to <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> and Peter Pettigrew together had sent <PER>Voldemort</PER> hunting after Lily and James and <PER>Snape</PER> and Peter Pettigrew Pettigrew together's son.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — I thought we were going to see the headmaster together?” “You stay here,” said <PER>Harry</PER> through numb lips.
“But dear I was going to tell <PER>Harry</PER> how I was assaulted in the Room of — ” “You stay here!” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated angrily.
She looked alarmed as <PER>Harry</PER> ran past She, around the corner into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not knock upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s door, <PER>Harry</PER> hammered; and the calm voice answered, “Enter” after <PER>Harry</PER> had already flung <PER>Harry</PER> into the room.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing at the window looking out at the grounds, a long, black traveling cloak in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s arms.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>, I promised that you could come with me.” For a moment or two, <PER>Harry</PER> did not understand; the conversation with Trelawney had driven everything else out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain seemed to be moving very slowly.
“Come with you ?” “Only if you wish it, of course.” “If I ” And then <PER>Harry</PER> remembered why <PER>Harry</PER> had been eager to come to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office in the first place.
“How is it protected?” “I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hesitated, then said, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.” “I’m coming,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, almost before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had finished speaking.
This seemed to show on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, for <PER>Dumbledore</PER> moved away from the window and looked more closely at <PER>Harry</PER>, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows.
“What has upset you?” “I’m not upset.” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you were never a good Occlumens — ” The word was the spark that ignited <PER>Harry</PER>’s fury.
“<PER>Snape</PER>!” <PER>Snape</PER> said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them.
“AND YOU LET HIM Breathing hard as though he was fighting, <PER>Harry</PER> turned away from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s knuckles in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused, biting <PER>Harry</PER>'s lip, and looked into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s lined face.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> made a terrible — ” “Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!” “Please let me finish.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> waited until <PER>Harry</PER> had nodded curtly, then went on.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> hated my dad like Professor <PER>Snape</PER> hated Sirius!
“And isn’t <PER>Voldemort</PER> convinced that Professor <PER>Snape</PER>’s on Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s side, even now?
“He’s up to something with <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> right now, right under your nose, and you still — ” “We have discussed this, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and now he sounded stern again.
“I have told you my views.” “You’re leaving the school tonight, and I’ll bet you haven’t even considered that <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> might decide to — ” “To what?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his eyebrows raised.
“What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?” “I they’re up to something!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands curled into fists as he said it.
“I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.” <PER>Harry</PER> bit back <PER>Harry</PER>'s retort, scared that <PER>Harry</PER> had gone too far, that <PER>Harry</PER> had ruined <PER>Harry</PER>'s chance of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> went on, “Do you wish to come with me tonight?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
“Very well, then: Listen.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drew <PER>Dumbledore</PER> up to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s full height.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were sitting together in the common room when He came back.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, are you okay?” <PER>Hermione</PER> added anxiously.
<PER>Harry</PER> dashed up the stairs and into <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory, where <PER>Harry</PER> flung open <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and pulled out the Marauder’s Map and a pair of balled-up socks.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat, looking stunned.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not pause either for <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s gasps of horror or for <PER>Ron</PER>’s hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for they later.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’t be here tonight, so <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s going to have another clear shot at whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s up to.
“You’ve got to watch <PER>Malfoy</PER> and you’ve got to watch <PER>Snape</PER> too.
“Take this as well — ” <PER>Harry</PER> thrust the socks into <PER>Ron</PER>’s hands.
“We don’t want it, you take it, who knows what you’re going to be facing?” “I’ll be fine, I’ll be with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned as <PER>Harry</PER> came skidding out onto the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
“I would like you to wear your cloak, please,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> waited until <PER>Harry</PER> had thrown it on before saying, “Very good.
“But what will people think when people see you leaving, Professor?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind on <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, “will we be Apparating?” “Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair as <PER>Harry</PER> looked out at moonlit sea and star-strewn sky.
<PER>Harry</PER> was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were standing, looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> might have been asking <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Lumos,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reached the boulder closest to the cliff face.
“You see?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly, holding <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand a little higher.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak, stuffed it into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket, and followed.
The water was icy; <PER>Harry</PER>’s waterlogged clothes billowed around <PER>Harry</PER>’s and weighed <PER>Harry</PER>’s down.
Taking deep breaths that filled <PER>Harry</PER>'s nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, <PER>Harry</PER> struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff.
<PER>Harry</PER> continued to swim in <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s wake, the tips of <PER>Harry</PER>'s benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Dumbledore</PER> rising out of the water ahead, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s silver hair and dark robes gleaming.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the spot <PER>Harry</PER> found steps that led into a large cave.
<PER>Harry</PER> clambered up them, water streaming from <PER>Harry</PER>'s soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing in the middle of the cave, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand held high as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not tell whether the shivers <PER>Harry</PER> was experiencing were due to <PER>Harry</PER>'s spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things <PER>Harry</PER> could not see.
Twice <PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as Twice <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could, occasionally pausing, running Twice <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally Twice <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stopped, Twice <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand pressed flat against the wall.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stepped back from the cave wall and pointed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand at the rock.
“You’ve d-done it!” said <PER>Harry</PER> through chattering teeth, but before the words had left <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m so sorry, I forgot,” <PER>Harry</PER> said; <PER>Harry</PER> now pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at <PER>Harry</PER> and at once, <PER>Harry</PER>’s clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.
“Thank you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> gratefully, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had already turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s attention back to the solid cave wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> stayed quite still; <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to break <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s concentration.
“Blood, if I am not much mistaken.” “Blood?” “I said it was crude,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> had fallen short of the standards <PER>Dumbledore</PER> expected.
“Professor!” protested <PER>Harry</PER>, hurrying forward as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s knife.
“You are very kind, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now passing the tip of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as <PER>Snape</PER> had healed <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wounds.
“After me, I think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked through the archway with <PER>Harry</PER> on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s heels, lighting <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own wand hastily as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> went.
“Certainly we could,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, stopping so suddenly that <PER>Harry</PER> almost walked into <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was still thundering as <PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Aha,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stopped again; this time, <PER>Harry</PER> really did walk into <PER>Harry</PER>; for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> toppled on the edge of the dark water, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s uninjured hand closed tightly around <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s upper arm, pulling <PER>Dumbledore</PER> back.
This time <PER>Harry</PER> was running <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, not over the rocky wall, but through the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip something invisible.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> moved closer to the water; <PER>Harry</PER> watched nervously as the tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim.
Keeping <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand clenched in midair, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> tapped the chain, which began to slide through <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water.
<PER>Harry</PER> gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I think <PER>Voldemort</PER> would have been prepared to risk what was, to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s lake.
They were crammed in together; <PER>Harry</PER> could not comfortably sit, but crouched, <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began to move at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw the reflected gold of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” “I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand!” “Yes, I am sure you did,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“So that thing that jumped out of the water — ?” But <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s answer before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, <PER>Harry</PER>'s open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair and <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes swirling around <PER>Harry</PER> like smoke.
“There are bodies in here!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
“Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> placidly, “but we do not need to worry about them at the moment.” “At the moment?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, tearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s gaze from the water to look at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not pretend now that <PER>Harry</PER> was not scared.
The great black lake, teeming with the dead It seemed hours and hours ago that <PER>Harry</PER> had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> Felix Felicis.
Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that <PER>Harry</PER> could not see at first, but when <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s illuminated wand <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake.
“Careful not to touch the water,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> again as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed out of the boat.
<PER>Harry</PER> squinted at it; at first, <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then <PER>Harry</PER> saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> approached the basin and <PER>Harry</PER> followed.
“Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pushed back the sleeve of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s robe over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s burned fingers toward the surface of the potion.
“Out of the way, please, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring soundlessly.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained silent while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> worked, but after a while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> withdrew <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt it was safe to talk again.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion.
“Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> would not want to kill the person who reached this island.” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe it.
“Sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice reasonable, “sir, this is <PER>Voldemort</PER> we’re — ” “I’m sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>; I should have said, <PER>Harry</PER> would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> corrected <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how them managed to penetrate so far through <PER>Harry</PER>'s defenses and, most importantly of all, why them were so intent upon emptying the basin.
Was this why <PER>Harry</PER> had been invited along — so that <PER>Harry</PER> could force-feed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> a potion that might cause him unendurable pain?
“You remember,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “the condition on which I brought you with me?” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin.
“But what if — ?” “You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?” “Yes, but — ” “I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but — ” “Well, then,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, “you have my orders.” “Why can’t I drink the potion instead?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> desperately.
“Once and for all, <PER>Harry</PER>, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?” “Couldn’t — ?” “Do I have it?” “But — ” “ Your word, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “I — all right, but — ” Before <PER>Harry</PER> could make any further protest, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lowered the crystal goblet into the potion.
For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> hoped that <PER>Harry</PER> would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lifted the glass to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mouth.
“Your good health, <PER>Harry</PER>.” And <PER>Harry</PER> drained the goblet.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched, terrified, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingertips were numb.
“How do you feel?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes closed.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Harry</PER> was in pain.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, his voice strained.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> face was twitching as though Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> panted and then spoke in a voice <PER>Harry</PER> did not recognize, for <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard <PER>Dumbledore</PER> frightened like this.
“I don’t want Don’t make me ” <PER>Harry</PER> stared into the whitened face <PER>Harry</PER> knew so well, at the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what to do. "
<PER>Harry</PER> tipped the contents of the goblet into <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s open mouth.
“Please make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and I’ll never, never again ” “This will make it stop, Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice cracking as <PER>Harry</PER> tipped the seventh glass of potion into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s mouth.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from <PER>Harry</PER>’s trembling hands as <PER>Harry</PER> moaned, “Don’t hurt them, don’t hurt them, please, please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead ” “Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, and once again <PER>Dumbledore</PER> obeyed <PER>Harry</PER>, opening <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth even as <PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot.
“Please, please, please, no not that, not that, I’ll do anything ” “Just drink, Professor, just drink ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drank like a child dying of thirst, but when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had finished, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> yelled again as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s insides were on fire.
“Just drink this It’ll be over all over!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face.
“No!” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung he down beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and heaved he over onto his back; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s glasses were askew, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s's mouth agape, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s's eyes closed.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “no, you’re not dead, you said it wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up — Rennervatel” he cried, his wand pointing at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened.
“Renneruate — sir — please — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyelids flickered; <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart leapt.
The goblet filled with clear water; <PER>Harry</PER> dropped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and brought the glass to his lips — but it was empty.
“But I had some — wait — AguamentiV’ said <PER>Harry</PER> again, pointing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the goblet.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> brain whirling in panic, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because <PER>Voldemort</PER> had planned it so <PER>Harry</PER> flung <PER>Harry</PER> over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish.
“Sir — here!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and lunging forward, <PER>Harry</PER> tipped the water clumsily over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s face.
It was the best <PER>Harry</PER> could do, for the icy feeling on <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water.
“Petrificus Totalusl” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed again, backing away as Petrificus Totalusl” <PER>Harry</PER> swiped Petrificus Totalusl” <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward Petrificus Totalusl” <PER>Harry</PER>.
Still slashing at the air with his wand, <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “ Sectumsempral SECTUMSEMPRAl” But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, their had no blood to spill: their walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as him backed away still farther, him felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless arms cold as death, and him's feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, and him knew there would be no release, that him would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s shattered soul.
They dropped <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms, but scrambled back up, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and staring around.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand was raised like a torch and from wand tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed the locket inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s robes.
Wordlessly, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gestured to <PER>Harry</PER> to come to <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> led <PER>Harry</PER> back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the water’s edge, where they slipped gratefully back into them's dark waters.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might not be able to climb into the boat; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> staggered a little as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> attempted it; all <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized him and helped him back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
“Sir,” panted <PER>Harry</PER>, “sir, I forgot — about fire — they were coming at me and I panicked — ” “Quite understandable,” murmured <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was alarmed to hear how faint <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice was.
They reached the bank with a little bump and <PER>Harry</PER> leapt out, then turned quickly to help <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Don’t worry, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, anxious about <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s extreme pallor and by <PER>Harry</PER>'s air of exhaustion.
They crossed the outer cave, and <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Dumbledore</PER> back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff.
“It’s going to be all right, sir,” <PER>Harry</PER> said over and over again, more worried by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s silence than <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s weakened voice.
“I am with you.” Once back under the starry sky, <PER>Harry</PER> heaved <PER>Dumbledore</PER> onto the top of the nearest boulder and then to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
Sodden and shivering, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s weight still upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> concentrated harder than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever done upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s destination: Hogsmeade.
Closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, gripping <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s arm as tightly as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stepped forward into that feeling of horrible compression.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew it had worked before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> opened <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes: The smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade.
For one horrible moment <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination showed <PER>Harry</PER> more Inferi creeping toward <PER>Harry</PER> around the sides of shops, but <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and saw that nothing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.
“We did it, Professor!” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered with difficulty; <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized that <PER>Harry</PER> had a searing stitch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Harry</PER>'s inexpert Apparition had thrown <PER>Dumbledore</PER> off balance; then <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp.
“Sir, are you all right?” “I’ve been better,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> weakly, though the corners of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mouth twitched.
“When did it appear?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand clenched painfully upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder as <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“Shall I run and fetch — ?” “No, <PER>Harry</PER> can do it.” <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at once.
As they sped toward the castle, <PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, ready to grab <PER>Harry</PER> should <PER>Harry</PER> fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> like a stimulant: <PER>Harry</PER> was bent low over <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes fixed upon the Mark, <PER>Harry</PER>'s long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air.
And <PER>Harry</PER> too looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside <PER>Harry</PER> like a venomous bubble, compressing <PER>Harry</PER>'s lungs, driving all other discomfort from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
Had <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>’s luck run out by now?
As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, <PER>Harry</PER> heard, over the whistling of the night air in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> muttering in some strange language again.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> understood why as <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle so they could enter at speed.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; <PER>Harry</PER> landed next to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seconds later and looked around.
“What does it mean?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, looking up at the green skull with its serpent’s tongue glinting evilly above them.
<PER>Harry</PER> backed away, drawing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand as <PER>Harry</PER> did so.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had wordlessly immobilized <PER>Harry</PER>, and the second <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had taken to perform the spell had cost <PER>Dumbledore</PER> the chance of defending <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> merely looked across at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s disarmer and said, “Good evening, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> stepped forward, glancing around quickly to check that <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were alone.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood imprisoned within <PER>Harry</PER>'s own invisible, paralyzed body, staring at the two of them, <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters’ distant fight, and in front of him, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> did nothing but stare at Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who, incredibly, smiled.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, you are not a killer.” “How do you know?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> at once.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> stiffened and glanced over <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s shoulder.
“I see,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> kindly, when <PER>Malfoy</PER> neither moved nor spoke.
“You are afraid to act until they join you.” “I’m not afraid!” snarled <PER>Malfoy</PER>, though he still made no move to hurt <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“He’s been offering me plenty of help — wanting all the glory for He — wanting a bit of the action — What are you doing?’ ‘Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything — ’ But I haven’t told him what I’ve been doing in the Room of Requirement, him’s going to wake up tomorrow and it’ll all be over and him won’t be <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s favorite anymore, him’ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!” “Very gratifying,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> mildly.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> looked nervously over <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s shoulder again, then back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who went on: “So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in Rosmerta's own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied?
“I had one and she had the other and I could send shis messages — ” “Isn’t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s Army used last year?” asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> voice was light and conversational, but <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> slip an inch lower down the wall as <PER>Harry</PER> said it.
“You care about me saying ‘Mudblood’ when I’m about to kill you?” “Yes, I do,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet slide a little on the floor as <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to remain upright.
There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> stood, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest.
“So let us discuss your options, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.” “My options!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw it drop by a fraction — But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs, and a second later <PER>Malfoy</PER> was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door onto the ramparts.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> cornered!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s sister and who was grinning eagerly.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wandless, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> alone!
<PER>Harry</PER> could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat, and, unmistakably, of blood coming from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And, yes, I am a little shocked that <PER>Malfoy</PER> here invited you, of all people, into the school where <PER>Malfoy</PER> here's friends live.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> here was not looking at Fenrir; <PER>Malfoy</PER> here did not seem to want to even glance at <PER>Malfoy</PER> here.
But <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hand was shaking so badly that <PER>Malfoy</PER> could barely aim.
“I’ll do it,” snarled Fenrir, moving toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hands outstretched, his teeth bared.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s spell — if him could only move, him could aim a curse from under the cloak — “<PER>Malfoy</PER>, do it or stand aside so one of us — ” screeched the woman, but at that precise moment, the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood <PER>Snape</PER>, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“We’ve got a problem, <PER>Snape</PER>,” said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “the boy doesn’t seem able — ” But somebody else had spoken <PER>Snape</PER>’s name, quite softly.
“Severus ” The sound frightened <PER>Harry</PER> beyond anything <PER>Harry</PER> had experienced all evening.
<PER>Snape</PER> said nothing, but walked forward and pushed <PER>Malfoy</PER> roughly out of the way.
<PER>Snape</PER> gazed for a moment at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of <PER>Snape</PER>'s face.
“Severus please ” <PER>Snape</PER> raised <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand and pointed it directly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Avada KedavraV’ A jet of green light shot from the end of <PER>Snape</PER>’s wand and hit <PER>Dumbledore</PER> squarely in the chest.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> seized <PER>Malfoy</PER> by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly.
As they vanished through the door, <PER>Harry</PER> realized <PER>Harry</PER> could move again.
“Petrificus Totalusl” The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but The Death Eater had barely hit the floor when <PER>Harry</PER> was clambering over <PER>Harry</PER> and running down the darkened staircase.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to get to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had to catch <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> landed, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand raised: The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but even as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> attempted to make out who was fighting whom, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> heard the hated voice shout, “It’s over, time to go\” and saw <PER>Snape</PER> disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> seemed to have forced he and <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s way through the fight unscathed.
He was on top of <PER>Harry</PER> before <PER>Harry</PER> could raise He's wand: <PER>Harry</PER> fell backward, with filthy matted hair in <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, the stench of sweat and blood filling <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat — “Petrificus Totalusl” <PER>Harry</PER> felt Fenrir collapse against <PER>Harry</PER>; with a stupendous effort <PER>Harry</PER> pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight.
<PER>Harry</PER> feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and <PER>Harry</PER> stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate.
<PER>Harry</PER> now saw red hair flying like flames in front of <PER>Harry</PER>: <PER>Ginny</PER> was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at <PER>Ginny</PER>'s while <PER>Ginny</PER> dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: “Crucio — Crucio — you can’t dance forever, pretty — ” “Impedimenta).” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>.
His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: His gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off His's feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down His's feet, and fell out of sight behind <PER>Ron</PER>, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater.
Beyond them, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window — “<PER>Harry</PER>, where did you come from?” <PER>Ginny</PER> cried, but there was no time to answer <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> must not escape, <PER>Snape</PER> must catch up with <PER>Snape</PER> — “Take that\” shouted Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, are you — ?” “M’all right,” muttered <PER>Neville</PER>, who was clutching his stomach, “<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Snape</PER> ’n’ <PER>Malfoy</PER> ran past ” “I know, I’m on it!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind <PER>Harry</PER>, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know.
<PER>Harry</PER> pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who must surely have reached the grounds by now.
“Out of the way!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, knocking two boys aside as <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase.
<PER>Harry</PER> flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: <PER>Harry</PER> could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate — by the looks of they, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> The cold night air ripped at <PER>Harry</PER>’s lungs as <PER>Harry</PER>’s tore after them; <PER>Harry</PER>’s saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted <PER>Harry</PER>’s's quarry.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse — Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and <PER>Harry</PER> understood: <PER>Hagrid</PER> had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, <PER>Harry</PER> sped up as an unbidden voice in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head said: not <PER>Hagrid</PER> not <PER>Hagrid</PER> too Something caught <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the small of the back and <PER>Harry</PER> fell forward, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: <PER>Harry</PER> knew, even as <PER>Harry</PER> rolled over, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind he.
And now he saw the vast outline of <PER>Hagrid</PER>, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s immense strength and the toughened skin <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s had inherited from <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's giantess mother seemed to be protecting him.
<PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, however, were still running; <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate — <PER>Harry</PER> tore past <PER>Hagrid</PER> and — <PER>Harry</PER>'s opponent, took aim at <PER>Snape</PER>’s back, and yelled, “Stupefy\” Stupefy\ missed; the jet of red light soared past <PER>Snape</PER>’s head; <PER>Snape</PER> shouted, “Run, <PER>Malfoy</PER>\” and turned.
Twenty yards apart, he and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each other before raising he and <PER>Harry</PER>'s wands simultaneously.
“Cruc — ” But <PER>Snape</PER> parried the curse, knocking <PER>Harry</PER> backward off <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet before <PER>Snape</PER> could complete it; <PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “Incendiol” <PER>Harry</PER> heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house was on fire.
“Cruc — ” yelled <PER>Harry</PER> for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but <PER>Snape</PER> blocked the spell again.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> sneering.
“You haven’t got the nerve or the ability — ” “Incarc — ” <PER>Harry</PER> roared, but <PER>Snape</PER> deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of <PER>Snape</PER>'s arm.
“It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up — ” “Impedi — ” But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> keeled over in the grass.
Someone was screaming, Someone would surely die of this agony, <PER>Snape</PER> was going to torture Someone to death or madness — “No!” roared <PER>Snape</PER>’s voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as <PER>Snape</PER>’s voice had started; <PER>Harry</PER> lay curled on the dark grass, clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and panting; somewhere overhead <PER>Snape</PER> was shouting, “Have you forgotten our orders?
<PER>Harry</PER> uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, <PER>Harry</PER> cared not whether <PER>Harry</PER> lived or died.
Pushing himself to himself's feet again, himself staggered blindly toward <PER>Snape</PER>, the man he now hated as much as himself hated <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself — “Sectum — !” <PER>Snape</PER> flicked <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but <PER>Harry</PER> was mere feet away now and <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Snape</PER>’s face clearly at last: <PER>Harry</PER> was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage.
Mustering all his powers of concentration, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, Levi — “No, Potter!” screamed <PER>Snape</PER>.
There was a loud BANG and <PER>Harry</PER> was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand flew out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
He could hear <PER>Hagrid</PER> yelling and Fang howling as <PER>Snape</PER> closed in and looked down on him where him lay, wandless and defenseless as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Kill me like you killed him, you coward — ” “DONT — ” screamed <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER>'s face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though <PER>Snape</PER> was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them — “CALL ME COWARD!” And he slashed at the air: <PER>Harry</PER> felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit <PER>Harry</PER> across the face and was slammed backward into the ground.
Spots of light burst in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from <PER>Harry</PER>'s body, then <PER>Harry</PER> heard a rush of wings above <PER>Harry</PER> and something enormous obscured the stars.
As <PER>Harry</PER> raised himself into a sitting position, himself's head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, himself saw <PER>Snape</PER> running as hard as himself could, the enormous beast flapping behind <PER>Snape</PER> and screeching as <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard <PER>Snape</PER> screech — <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to — <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, looking around groggily for <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as — <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, — <PER>Harry</PER> knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time — <PER>Harry</PER> had located — <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, — <PER>Harry</PER> turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, still dazed, looking around.
With a cry of thankfulness, <PER>Harry</PER> sank to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees; <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking in every limb, <PER>Harry</PER>'s body ached all over, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath came in painful stabs.
<PER>Harry</PER> could smell burnt wood and dog hair; <PER>Harry</PER> put out a hand and felt Fang’s reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you?” “ ’Course I am take more’n that ter finish me.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> put his hands under <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms and raised <PER>Harry</PER> up with such force that <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet momentarily left the ground before <PER>Hagrid</PER> set him upright again.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see blood trickling down <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.
“We should put out your house,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “the charm’s ‘Aguamenti’ ” “Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, “Aguamenti\” A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured “Aguamenti’ too: Together, he and <PER>Hagrid</PER> poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.
“Nothin’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’ be able to put righ’ ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a searing pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach at the sound of the name.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> ” “I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ’em cornin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, he killed ” “Killed?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> loudly, staring down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wha’, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s dead.
“<PER>Snape</PER> kill <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — don’ be stupid, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What musta happened was, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> musta told <PER>Snape</PER> ter go with them Death Eaters,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said confidently.
“What’re they all lookin’ at?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, as he and <PER>Harry</PER> approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as Fang could to their ankles.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in <PER>Harry</PER>'s face and <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s moan of pain and shock, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not stop; <PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly forward until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the place where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lay and crouched down beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had placed upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard <PER>Harry</PER> had ever, or would ever, meet.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s arms and legs, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might have been sleeping.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached out, straightened the half- moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with <PER>Harry</PER>'s own sleeve.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would <PER>Dumbledore</PER> speak to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, never again could <PER>Dumbledore</PER> help.
And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, as <PER>Harry</PER> picked it up, that there was something wrong.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned the locket over in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind <PER>Harry</PER>: To <PER>Voldemort</PER> I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy the real Horcrux as soon as I can.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had weakened <PER>Dumbledore</PER> by drinking that terrible potion for nothing.
<PER>Harry</PER> crumpled the parchment in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.
“C’mere, <PER>Harry</PER> ” “No.” “Yeh can’ stay here, <PER>Harry</PER> ” ”.
Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall.
Faces swam on the edges of <PER>Harry</PER>’s vision, people were peering at <PER>Harry</PER>, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase.
“It’s <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s orders,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Everyone’s up there, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and Lupin and everyone — ” Fear stirred in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest again: <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten the inert figures <PER>Harry</PER> had left behind.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, who else is dead?” “Don’t worry, none of us.” “But the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER> said the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER> stepped over a body — ” “the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER> stepped over Bill, but it’s all right, the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s alive.” There was something in her voice, however, that <PER>Harry</PER> knew boded ill. “Are you sure?” “Of course I’m sure the Dark Mark — <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s a — a bit of a mess, that’s all.
Pushing open the doors, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Neville</PER> lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ran to <PER>Harry</PER> and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill’s pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that <PER>Harry</PER> looked grotesque.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered how <PER>Snape</PER> had mended <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s Sectumsempra wounds so easily with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“No!” Lupin looked wildly from <PER>Ginny</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>, as though hoping the latter might contradict her, but when <PER>Harry</PER> did not, Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill’s bed, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands over <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never seen Lupin lose control before; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> was intruding upon something private, indecent.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned away and caught <PER>Ron</PER>’s eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what <PER>Ginny</PER> had said.
“How did it happen?” “<PER>Snape</PER> killed him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ — more Death Eaters arrived — and then <PER>Snape</PER> — and <PER>Snape</PER> did it.
And <PER>Harry</PER> felt, as <PER>Harry</PER> had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside <PER>Harry</PER>, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.
She stared at <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled She together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which She pushed under <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER>,” repeated <PER>McGonagall</PER> faintly, falling into the chair.
“We all wondered but <PER>Snape</PER> trusted always <PER>Snape</PER> I can’t believe it.
“We all always knew that.” “But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> swore <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was on our side!” whispered Tonks.
“I always thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> must know something about <PER>Snape</PER> that we didn’t.
“I mean with <PER>Snape</PER> ’s history of course people were bound to wonder but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told me explicitly that <PER>Snape</PER> ’s repentance was absolutely genuine.
“I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and they all turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> passed <PER>Voldemort</PER> the information that made <PER>Voldemort</PER> hunt down my mum and dad.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> believed <PER>Snape</PER> was sorry James was dead?
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked disoriented, twisting Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wet handkerchief in Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s hands.
“We all wanted more help, We all were glad to think <PER>Snape</PER> was on <PER>Snape</PER>'s way.
“So they got in through the Room of Requirement.” Almost against his will his glanced from <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>, both of whom looked devastated.
“I messed up, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> bleakly.
“We did like you told We: We checked the Marauder’s Map and we couldn’t see <PER>Malfoy</PER> on it, so We thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> went to keep watch on it but <PER>Malfoy</PER> got past We.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> came out of the room about an hour after We started keeping watch,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Gives light only to the holder, remember?” “Anyway,” <PER>Ginny</PER> went on, “he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black — ” “ — Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said <PER>Ron</PER> bitterly.
“But I don’t think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, because Gibbon came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.” “So if <PER>Ron</PER> was watching the Room of Requirement with <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, turning to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “were you — ?” “Outside <PER>Snape</PER>’s office, yes,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes sparkling with tears, “with Luna.
“I was so stupid, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a high- pitched whisper.
“We went into his office to see if We could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor and oh, it’s so obvious now, <PER>Snape</PER> must have Stupefied Flitwick, but We didn’t realize, <PER>Harry</PER>, We didn’t realize, We just let <PER>Snape</PER> go!” “It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, had you not obeyed <PER>Snape</PER> and got out of the way, <PER>Snape</PER> probably would have killed you and Luna.” “So then <PER>Snape</PER> came upstairs,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who was watching <PER>Snape</PER> running up the marble staircase in <PER>Snape</PER>'s mind’s eye, <PER>Snape</PER>'s black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling him's wand from under him's cloak as he ascended, “and he found the place where you were all fighting.
“We thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters — and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and We were fighting again — I thought I heard <PER>Snape</PER> shout something, but I don’t know what — ” “<PER>Snape</PER> shouted, ‘It’s over,’ ” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Minerva, is it true Is he really ?” As Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> nodded, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ginny</PER> move beside him and looked at her.
Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, <PER>Harry</PER> turned around: <PER>Ron</PER> looked as stunned as <PER>Harry</PER> felt and <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were exchanging startled looks.
The little of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was shaking with tears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand.
It was several minutes before <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that they were not heading for Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s office, but for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, and another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress.
In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when He and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on He and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s spindle-legged tables, Gryffindor’s sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk.
And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s half- moon spectacles perched upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.
After glancing once at this portrait, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the desk to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, herself's face taut and lined.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” she said, “I would like to know what you and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were doing this evening when you left the school.” “I can’t tell you that, Professor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had expected the question and had <PER>Harry</PER>'s answer ready.
It had been here, in this very room, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, it might be important,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“It is,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “very, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want me to tell anyone.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> glared at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Potter” — <PER>Harry</PER> registered the renewed use of — <PER>Harry</PER>'s surname — “in the light of Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat — “I don’t think so,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shrugging.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told me to stop following Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s orders if Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died.” “But — ” “There’s one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though.
“What are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, “I dunno, Professor that’s fer the Heads of House an’ the headmistress ter decide ” “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> always valued your views,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> kindly, “and so do I.” “Well, I’m stayin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard.
“Well ” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, losing a little of Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s briskness as her voice shook.
“I — I know that it was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts — ” “Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely.
As <PER>Harry</PER> had hoped, <PER>Ron</PER> was waiting for <PER>Harry</PER>, still fully dressed, sitting on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.
“Someone had already taken it and left a fake in it place.” “Already taken — ?” Wordlessly, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the fake locket from <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket, opened it, and passed it to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“R.A.B.,” whispered <PER>Ron</PER>, “but who was that?” “Dunno,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, lying back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards.
: <PER>Harry</PER> doubted that <PER>Harry</PER> would ever feel curious again.
As <PER>Harry</PER> lay there, <PER>Harry</PER> became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent.
And Fawkes knew, without knowing how Fawkes knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left the school, had left the world had left <PER>Harry</PER>.
she had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, for wizards and witches were pouring into the village, preparing to pay wizards and witches's last respects to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s arms.
<PER>Harry</PER> was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that, sooner or later, <PER>Harry</PER> would be asked again to account for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s last excursion from Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were spending all of their time together.
The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; <PER>Harry</PER> could imagine how it would have been if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the year, <PER>Ginny</PER>’s examinations finished, the pressure of homework lifted and hour by hour, <PER>Harry</PER> put off saying the thing that <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> must say, doing what <PER>Harry</PER> knew was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo <PER>Harry</PER>'s best source of comfort.
<PER>Neville</PER> scars were as bad as ever — in truth, <PER>Neville</PER> now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs — but in personality His seemed just the same as ever.
so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said this.” “I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,” sighed <PER>Ginny</PER> later that evening, as she, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over the twilit grounds.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.” “Anyone else we know died?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.
“They’re still looking for <PER>Snape</PER> but no sign ” “Of course there isn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who became angry every time this subject cropped up.
“They won’t find <PER>Snape</PER> till They find <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and seeing as They’ve never managed to do that in all this time ” “I’m going to go to bed,” yawned <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“I haven’t been sleeping that well since well I could do with some sleep.” She kissed <PER>Harry</PER> (<PER>Ron</PER> looked away pointedly), waved at the other two, and departed for the girls’ dormitories.
The moment the door had closed behind her, <PER>Hermione</PER> leaned forward toward <PER>Harry</PER> with a most <PER>Hermione</PER>-ish look on her face.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not feel the way <PER>Harry</PER> had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; <PER>Harry</PER> simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before <PER>Harry</PER> could move a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>, the path that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had set out upon together, and which <PER>Harry</PER> now knew <PER>Harry</PER> would have to journey alone.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> kept reciting their names to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, as though by listing them <PER>Voldemort</PER> could bring them within reach: the locket the cup the snake something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s the locket the cup the snake something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s This mantra seemed to pulse through <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind as <PER>Harry</PER> fell asleep at night, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s dreams were thick with cups, lockets, and mysterious objects that <PER>Harry</PER> could not quite reach, though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> helpfully offered <PER>Harry</PER> a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment <PER>Harry</PER> began to climb.
<PER>Harry</PER> had shown <PER>Hermione</PER> the note inside the locket the morning after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s death, and although she had not immediately recognized the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.
“What about him?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> heavily, slumping back in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias <PER>Snape</PER>, and then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a “ — murderer,” spat <PER>Harry</PER>.
he could not stop he dwelling upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s inexcusable trust in <PER>Snape</PER> but as <PER>Hermione</PER> had just inadvertently reminded him, he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had been taken in just the same.
“I don’t think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have liked it very much if <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d known.
“All that time he was showing me how <PER>Voldemort</PER> was evil even when <PER>Voldemort</PER> was at school, and I had proof <PER>Snape</PER> was too — ” “ ‘Evil’ is a strong word,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
Silence fell between them, each of them lost in them's own thoughts, but <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that they, like <PER>Harry</PER>, were thinking about the following morning, when <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body would be laid to rest.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s might see, about how <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s would feel.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s wondered whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s death would be more real to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> once it was over.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s chair was deserted too; <PER>Harry</PER> thought that perhaps <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s had not been able to face breakfast, but <PER>Snape</PER>’s place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour.
<PER>Harry</PER> avoided <PER>Harry</PER>'s yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; <PER>Harry</PER> had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not spared <PER>Malfoy</PER> much thought.
<PER>Harry</PER> animosity was all for <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had not forgotten the fear in <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice on that tower top, nor the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> had lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand before the other Death Eaters arrived.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not believe that <PER>Malfoy</PER> would have killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> despised <PER>Malfoy</PER> still for <PER>Harry</PER>'s infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with <PER>Harry</PER>'s dislike.
Where, <PER>Harry</PER> wondered, was <PER>Malfoy</PER> now, and what was <PER>Voldemort</PER> making <PER>Harry</PER> do under threat of killing <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had risen to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s feet, and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once.
They were heading, as <PER>Harry</PER> saw when <PER>Harry</PER> stepped out onto the stone steps from the front doors, toward the lake.
Most <PER>Harry</PER> did not recognize, but a few Most <PER>Harry</PER> did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands; Mister and Molly; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin.
Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs on her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in London; Arabella Figg, <PER>Harry</PER>’s Squib neighbor; the hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some people whom <PER>Harry</PER> merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake.
The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of The crowd, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Neville</PER> being helped into a seat by Luna.
had responded to <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s summons the night that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had died, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew why: They were the ones who had missed the D.A.
<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge walked past toward the front rows, <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge's expression miserable, twirling <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge's green bowler hat as usual; <PER>Harry</PER> next recognized <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, who, <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-taloned hand, and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-colored curls.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was dead.
But then <PER>Harry</PER> heard music, strange, otherworldly music, and <PER>Harry</PER> forgot <PER>Harry</PER>'s dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it.
“In there,” whispered <PER>Ginny</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
He was crying quite silently, He's face gleaming with tears, and in He's arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what <PER>Harry</PER> knew to be <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body.
A sharp pain rose in <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat at this sight: For a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day.
Tears were falling thick and fast into both <PER>Ginny</PER> ’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s laps.
Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalized looks from some, including, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER> but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would not have cared.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to make a friendly gesture to <PER>Hagrid</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> passed, but <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s eyes were so swollen it was a wonder <PER>Harry</PER> could see where <PER>Harry</PER> was going.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at the back row to which <PER>Hagrid</PER> was heading and realized what was guiding <PER>Harry</PER>, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost human.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> sat down next to his half-brother, and Grawp patted <PER>Hagrid</PER> hard on his great ugly boulderlike head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not hear what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying.
It had little to do with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> had known him.
him remembered <PER>Dumbledore</PER> crouching at the water’s edge two years ago, very close to where <PER>Harry</PER> now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had learned Mermish.
There was so much <PER>Harry</PER> had never asked <PER>Harry</PER>, so much <PER>Harry</PER> should have said.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> clutched the cold locket in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand so tightly that it hurt, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could not prevent hot tears spilling from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked away from <PER>Ginny</PER> and the others and stared out over the lake, toward the forest, as the little man in black droned on.
And <PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Harry</PER>'s first nightmarish trip into the forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and how he had faced <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and how he and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter.
And <PER>Harry</PER> saw very clearly as <PER>Harry</PER> sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about <PER>Harry</PER> had stood in front of <PER>Harry</PER> one by one, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother, <PER>Harry</PER>'s father, <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather, and finally <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, all determined to protect him; but now that was over.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited for somebody else to get to their feet; <PER>Harry</PER> expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.
White smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shapes: <PER>Harry</PER> thought, for one heart- stopping moment, that <PER>Harry</PER> saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished.
In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body and the table on which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had rested.
It was, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, the centaurs’ tribute: <PER>Harry</PER> saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>: <PER>Ron</PER>’s face was screwed up as though the sunlight were blinding him.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face was glazed with tears, but <PER>Ginny</PER> was no longer crying.
<PER>Hermione</PER> met <PER>Harry</PER>’s gaze with the same hard, blazing look that <PER>Harry</PER> had seen when <PER>Hermione</PER> had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in him's absence, and him knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when him told <PER>Hermione</PER>'s what him was going to do now, <PER>Hermione</PER> would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t do it,” but accept him's decision, because <PER>Hermione</PER> would not have expected anything less of him.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> uses people <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s enemies are close to.
<PER>Ron</PER>, he saw, was now holding <PER>Hermione</PER> and stroking her hair while her sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose.
With a miserable gesture, <PER>Harry</PER> got up, turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on <PER>Ginny</PER> and on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s tomb, and walked away around the lake.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Voldemort</PER> turned.
Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick, and stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s expression shrewd now.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> wants to kill me “<PER>Voldemort</PER>, and Aurors won’t stop <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“I see you are — ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s man through and through,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for <PER>Harry</PER>, casting nervous glances at the sobbing <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Grawp, who were still in their seats.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were hurrying toward <PER>Harry</PER>, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction.
“Wanted me to give him inside information on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and be the Ministry’s new poster boy.” <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then himself said loudly to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Look, let me go back and hit Percy!” “No,” she said firmly, grabbing his arm.
Even <PER>Hermione</PER> grinned a little, though Even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s smile faded as Even <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up at the castle.
<PER>Ron</PER> gaped at him, but <PER>Hermione</PER> said sadly, “I knew you were going to say that.
<PER>Harry</PER> had had the idea in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head ever since the night of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s death.
“Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven’t I?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of the lake.
“Well be there, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“And then well go with you wherever you’re going.” “No — ” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly; <PER>Harry</PER> had not counted on this, <PER>Harry</PER> had meant them to understand that <PER>Harry</PER> was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone.
“But mate, you’re going to have to come round my mum and dad’s house before we do anything else, even Godric’s Hollow.” “Why?” “Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.
“Severus, here,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, indicating the seat on <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s immediate right.
Most of the eyes around the table followed <PER>Snape</PER>, and it was to <PER>Snape</PER> that <PER>Voldemort</PER> spoke first.
“So?” “My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move <PER>Harry</PER> Potter from <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.” The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER>, however, looked calmly back into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s face and, after a moment or two, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.
“My Lord.” Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
“My Lord, I have heard differently.” Yaxley waited, but <PER>Voldemort</PER> did not speak, so <PER>Voldemort</PER> went on, “Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.” <PER>Snape</PER> was smiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> seemed to be lost in thought.
“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy <PER>Voldemort</PER> held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as <PER>Voldemort</PER> turned back to <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER>, however, seemed to be speaking more to <PER>Voldemort</PER> than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Wormtail,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, with no change in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s eyes from the revolving body above, “have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?” “Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in a small man's chair that it had appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied.
“As I was saying,” continued <PER>Voldemort</PER>, looking again at the tense faces of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s followers, “I understand better now.
Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, and Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes were sunken and shadowed.
At Shis touch, <PER>Malfoy</PER> put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed a wand along to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely.
Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> expected to receive <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand in exchange for Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s own.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“We did desire it — We do.” To <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, his wife's eyes averted from <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the snake.
To his right, his son, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at <PER>Voldemort</PER> and away again, terrified to make eye contact.
“Will you babysit the cubs?” The hilarity mounted; <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked in terror at <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s father, who was staring down into <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s own lap, then caught <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s mother’s eye.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “Enough,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, stroking the angry snake.
<PER>Snape</PER> raised <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes to the upside-down face.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “And you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” asked <PER>Voldemort</PER>, stroking the snake’s snout with <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand-free hand.
“Severus please please ” “Silence,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, with another twitch of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked back at her, quite impassive, as her turned slowly away from <PER>Snape</PER> again.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> fell out of <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s onto the floor.
“Dinner, Nagini,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered from <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s shoulders onto the polished wood.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER> was bleeding.
Clutching <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand in <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER>'s left and swearing under <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER> shouldered open <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom door.
Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, <PER>Harry</PER> scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom door.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> tramped across to the bathroom to run <PER>Harry</PER>'s finger under the tap.
<PER>Harry</PER> had spent the morning completely emptying <PER>Harry</PER>'s school trunk for the first time since <PER>Harry</PER> had packed it six years ago.
Minutes previously, <PER>Harry</PER> had plunged <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood.
<PER>Harry</PER> laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather’s last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat up and examined the jagged piece on which <PER>Harry</PER> had cut <PER>Harry</PER>, seeing nothing but <PER>Harry</PER>'s own bright green eye reflected back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk.
As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, <PER>Harry</PER> slowed down, searching for one particular issue that <PER>Harry</PER> knew had arrived shortly after <PER>Harry</PER> had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts.
Turning to page ten, <PER>Harry</PER> sank into <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk chair and reread the article <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking for.
Beyond that, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> refused to speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make <PER>Dumbledore</PER> do so.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would become Minister of Magic.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was never proud or vain; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was wearing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying <PER>Harry</PER>, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.
Never once had he imagined <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as <PER>Harry</PER> had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old.
The idea of a teenage <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid <PER>Hermione</PER> or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and <PER>Harry</PER> had not thought to ask <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what that had been like, nor about any of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s other famous achievements.
No, they had always discussed <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s past, <PER>Harry</PER>’s future, <PER>Harry</PER>’s plans and it seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> now, despite the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>'s future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that <PER>Harry</PER> had missed irreplaceable opportunities when <PER>Harry</PER> had failed to ask <PER>Dumbledore</PER> more about <PER>Harry</PER>, even though the only personal question <PER>Harry</PER> had ever asked <PER>Harry</PER>'s headmaster was also the only one <PER>Harry</PER> suspected that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not answered honestly: “ What do you see when you look in the mirror?” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “!?
<PER>Harry</PER> had merely glanced at the headline when <PER>Harry</PER> had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
It was only now, therefore, that <PER>Harry</PER> saw what <PER>Harry</PER> had missed.
Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> carried to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s grave.
HOW did <PER>Dumbledore</PER> really meet <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s end?
The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, by <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page 13, inside.
In person, <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter is much warmer and softer than <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's famously ferocious quill-portraits might suggest.
Greeting me in the hallway of <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's cozy home, <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip.
“Well, of course, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is a biographer’s dream,” says <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter.
“I’m afraid those who go dewy-eyed over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s spectacular victory must brace those who go dewy-eyed over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s spectacular victory for a bombshell — or perhaps a Dungbomb.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s legions of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s legions of admirers's hero.
his began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what his was doing, as random phrases from <PER>Rita</PER>’s article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter-<PER>Dumbledore</PER> relationship It’s been called unhealthy, even sinister .
his dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth I’ve had access to a source most journalists would swap most journalists's wands for “Lies!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, and through the window <PER>Harry</PER> saw the next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart <PER>Harry</PER>'s lawn mower, look up nervously.
The broken bit of mirror danced away from <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> picked it up and turned it over in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers, thinking, thinking of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and the lies with which <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was defaming him.
<PER>Harry</PER> froze, <PER>Harry</PER>'s cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had imagined it, <PER>Harry</PER> must have done.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia’s choosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect.
<PER>Harry</PER> peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but <PER>Harry</PER>'s own bright green eye looking back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because <PER>Harry</PER> had been thinking of <PER>Harry</PER>'s dead headmaster.
It was not until his uncle bellowed, “BOY!” that <PER>Harry</PER> got slowly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things <PER>Harry</PER> would be taking with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Get down here, I want a word!” <PER>Harry</PER> strolled downstairs, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands deep in <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans pockets.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the living room <PER>Harry</PER> found all three Dursleys.
They were dressed for traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling a neat salmon-colored coat, and <PER>Dudley</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s large, blond, muscular cousin, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s leather jacket.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyebrows.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was coming.
<PER>Harry</PER> uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER> following his movements with anxious expressions.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s favorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that <PER>Dudley</PER> had added <PER>Harry</PER>'s dumbbells to <PER>Harry</PER>'s case since the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had rather impressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle with this argument.
“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that this Lord Thing — ” “ — <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, “and we’ve been through this about a hundred times already.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to admit, however, that as Arthur had once demolished half of the living room, <PER>Harry</PER>'s reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.
Getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, <PER>Harry</PER> advanced on <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle, now pointing at the TV set <PER>Harry</PER>.
With his parents’ and <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes upon him, him slowly lowered them again and asked, “There are more of them?” “More?” laughed <PER>Harry</PER>.
Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; <PER>Dudley</PER> was staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They will torture and kill you like They did my parents !” “Dad,” said <PER>Dudley</PER> in a loud voice, “Dad — I’m going with these Order people.” “<PER>Dudley</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “for the first time in your life, you’re talking sense.” He knew that the battle was won.
“They’ll be here in about five minutes,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and when none of the Dursleys replied, <PER>Harry</PER> left the room.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling Back in his bedroom, <PER>Harry</PER> fiddled aimlessly with <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack, then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, then headed back out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s room and downstairs.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow.
“There’s no need,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly, “Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.” He swung He's right arm upward to shake <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome.
<PER>Dudley</PER> did not answer, but stood there with <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth slightly ajar, reminding <PER>Harry</PER> a little of the giant, Grawp.
<PER>Dudley</PER> raised a large, hamlike hand to point at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, he — he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at <PER>Harry</PER> and adding, “You don’t want to, do you?” “Not in the slightest,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had met this attitude before: Witches and wizards seemed stunned that <PER>Harry</PER>'s closest living relatives took so little interest in the famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
“these people think I’m a waste of space, actually, but I’m used to — ” “I don’t think you’re a waste of space.” If <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen <PER>Dudley</PER>’s lips move, <PER>Harry</PER> might not have believed it.
As it was, <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Dudley</PER> for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing, <PER>Dudley</PER> had turned red.
<PER>Harry</PER> was embarrassed and astonished <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well er thanks, <PER>Dudley</PER>.” Again, <PER>Dudley</PER> appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling, “You saved my life.” “Not really,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
They had had virtually no contact during this summer or last, as <PER>Harry</PER> had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to <PER>Harry</PER>'s room so much.
It now dawned on <PER>Harry</PER>, however, that the cup of cold tea on which <PER>Harry</PER> had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all.
Hestia Jones gave Aunt Petunia's an approving look that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced <PER>Dudley</PER> rather than <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He only said He didn’t think <PER>Harry</PER> was a waste of space!” “Yeah, but coming from <PER>Dudley</PER> that’s like ‘I love you,’ ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at <PER>Dudley</PER> as if he had just saved <PER>Harry</PER> from a burning building.
“Our thoughts go with you.” “I hope everything’s okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER>.
<PER>Dudley</PER> gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and walked toward <PER>Harry</PER>, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic.
“Blimey, <PER>Dudley</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs, “did the dementors blow a different personality into you?” “Dunno,” muttered <PER>Dudley</PER>.
“See you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “Yeah ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, taking <PER>Dudley</PER>’s hand and shaking it.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Harry</PER>'s heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed.
For a moment <PER>Harry</PER> had the strangest feeling that She wanted to say something to <PER>Harry</PER>: She gave <PER>Harry</PER> an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little jerk of Shis head, She bustled out of the room after Shis husband and son.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER> ran back upstairs to <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's bedroom, arriving at the window just in time to see the Dursleys’ car swinging out of the drive and off up the road.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up Hedwig’s cage, <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack, gave <PER>Harry</PER>'s unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made <PER>Harry</PER>'s ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where <PER>Harry</PER> deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs.
But <PER>Harry</PER> could still remember the dreams that had dogged <PER>Harry</PER>, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once — Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when <PER>Harry</PER> had recounted the car — a flying motorbike There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby.
<PER>Harry</PER> straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head on the low door frame.
There was a general cry of greeting as <PER>Hermione</PER> flung her arms around him, <PER>Ron</PER> clapped him on the back, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, “All righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Let’s get undercover before we talk you through it.” <PER>Harry</PER> led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat they upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against Aunt Petunia’s's spotless appliances: <PER>Ron</PER>, long and lanky; <PER>Hermione</PER>, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long- P a g e ?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: <PER>Harry</PER>’s felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom <PER>Harry</PER>’s had tried to strangle the last time they had met.
“So what are we going to do?” “We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s motorbike.” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER> could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them.
“Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER> did not smile.
“Funny,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “really amusing.” “If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as his glared at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“With <PER>Voldemort</PER> out there and half the Ministry on <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s side?
“So, Potter — some of your hair, if you please.” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who grimaced at him in a just- do-it sort of way.
With all of their eyes upon him, <PER>Harry</PER> reached up to the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.
“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, before catching sight of <PER>Ron</PER>’s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, “Oh, you know what I mean — Goyle ’s potion looked like bogies.” “Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,” said Moody.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink.
“Here,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> gruffly, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> gruffly lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead.
“Altogether, then ” <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and Mundungus were shooting upward; <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s and Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls.
“I knew <PER>Ginny</PER> was lying about that tattoo,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking down at his bare chest.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, your eyesight really is awful,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> put on glasses.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom — ” “Why’m I with you?” grunted the <PER>Harry</PER> nearest the back door.
“She’s not that fond of brooms.” Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look that <PER>Harry</PER> hoped with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart would never appear on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face again.
“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hermione</PER> too lacked confidence on a broomstick.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Ron</PER> did not look quite as pleased as <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“An’ the last time yeh was on it, <PER>Harry</PER>, I could fit yeh in one hand!” <PER>Harry</PER> could not help but feel a little humiliated as <PER>Harry</PER> got into the sidecar.
It placed <PER>Harry</PER> several feet below everybody else: <PER>Ron</PER> smirked at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER> sitting there like a child in a bumper car.
<PER>Harry</PER> stuffed <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack and broomstick down by <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees.
“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, quite oblivious to <PER>Harry</PER>’s discomfort.
<PER>Harry</PER> settled <PER>Harry</PER> astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground.
“Hold tight now, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said Tonks, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side of her waist.
<PER>Harry</PER> lost any sense of where they were: Streetlights above <PER>Harry</PER>, yells around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was clinging to the sidecar for dear life.
“No — NO!” The motorbike zoomed forward; <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as <PER>Hagrid</PER> blasted through their circle.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, TURN “My job’s ter get you there safe, <PER>Harry</PER>!” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>!” opened the throttle.
“Stop — STOP!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, but as <PER>Harry</PER> looked back again two jets of green light flew past <PER>Harry</PER>'s left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing Four Death Eaters, aiming for <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s broad back.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and <PER>Harry</PER> had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them.
“Hold on, <PER>Harry</PER>, this’ll do for ’em!” roared <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked up just in time to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge.
Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky: <PER>Harry</PER> vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, <PER>Harry</PER>'s broomstick broken into pieces.
One of <PER>Harry</PER>'s fellows slowed up to save <PER>Harry</PER>, but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as <PER>Hagrid</PER> leaned low over the handlebars and sped up.
More Killing Curses flew past <PER>Harry</PER>’s head from the two remaining Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening — “Here we go again, <PER>Harry</PER>, hold on!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> jabbed at a second button.
“This’ll do it, <PER>Harry</PER>, hold on tight!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer.
“It’s all righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>!” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, now thrown flat onto his back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike’s slipstream.
‘Tm on it, <PER>Harry</PER>, don’ worry!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket his pulled his flowery pink umbrella.
“I’m cornin’, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> yelled from out of the darkness, but <PER>Harry</PER> could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as <PER>Harry</PER> could, <PER>Harry</PER> pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, “Impedimental” The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment <PER>Harry</PER> was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though <PER>Harry</PER> had hit an invisible barrier: One of <PER>Harry</PER>'s fellows almost collided with <PER>Harry</PER> — Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat — “I’m cornin’, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m cornin’!” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling A huge hand seized the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes and hoisted <PER>Harry</PER> out of the plummeting sidecar; <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack with <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> dragged <PER>Harry</PER> onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself back-to- back with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death Eaters, <PER>Harry</PER> spat blood out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, “Confringo\” <PER>Harry</PER> knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest the Death Eater nearest was blasted off the Death Eater nearest] broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “I shouldn’ta tried ter repair it meself — yeh’ve got no room — ” “It’s not a problem, just keep flying!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer.
As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, <PER>Hagrid</PER> swerved and zigzagged: <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hagrid</PER> did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with <PER>Harry</PER> seated so insecurely.
<PER>Harry</PER> shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and The closest Death Eater's hood slipped, and by the red light of The closest Death Eater's next Stunning Spell, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike — Stan — “ ExpelliarmusV’ <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’s happened?” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Where Ve they gone?” “I don’t know!” But <PER>Harry</PER> was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted “It’s the real one!”; how had <PER>Harry</PER> known?
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of here!” “Hold on tight, then, <PER>Harry</PER>!” There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust: <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> slipping backward off what little of the seat <PER>Harry</PER> had, <PER>Hagrid</PER> flung backward upon <PER>Harry</PER>, barely maintaining <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip on the handlebars — “I think we’ve lost ’em <PER>Harry</PER>, I think we’ve done it!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was not convinced: Fear lapped at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> looked left and right for pursuers <PER>Harry</PER> was sure would come.
“We’re nearly there, <PER>Harry</PER>, we’ve nearly made it!” shouted <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Then the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead burned like fire; as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed <PER>Harry</PER> by millimeters, cast from behind — And then <PER>Harry</PER> saw him.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s snakelike face gleaming out of the blackness, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s white fingers raising <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand again — <PER>Hagrid</PER> let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw a body fly past <PER>Harry</PER> and knew <PER>Harry</PER> had hit one of them, but then <PER>Harry</PER> heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control — Green jets of light shot past them again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no idea which way was up, which down: <PER>Harry</PER> scar was still burning; <PER>Harry</PER> expected to die at any second.
A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, <PER>Harry</PER> saw it raise it arm — With a shout of fury <PER>Hagrid</PER> launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to his horror, <PER>Harry</PER> saw both <PER>Hagrid</PER> and the Death Eater falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the broomstick — Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> scream, “Mine\” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling It was over: He could not see or hear where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was; He glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, “Avada — ” As the pain from <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own accord.
The remaining Death Eater yelled; <PER>Voldemort</PER> screamed, “ No\ Somehow, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose an inch from the dragon-fire button.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> — Accio <PER>Hagrid</PER>l” The motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth.
Face level with the handlebars, <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: <PER>Harry</PER> was going to crash and there was nothing <PER>Harry</PER> could do about it.
Behind <PER>Harry</PER> came another scream, “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand\” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Voldemort</PER> before <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: <PER>Voldemort</PER> preparing to curse <PER>Voldemort</PER> once more — And then <PER>Voldemort</PER> vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> spread-eagled on the ground below <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting <PER>Harry</PER>, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground-trembling crash, <PER>Harry</PER> smashed into a muddy pond.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “<PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to raise <PER>Harry</PER> out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands sank into inches of muddy water as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to stand.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not understand where <PER>Voldemort</PER> had gone and expected <PER>Voldemort</PER> to swoop out of the darkness at any moment.
Something hot and wet was trickling down <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s chin and from <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s forehead.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s fine, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing to <PER>Harry</PER> now.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder and pushing <PER>Harry</PER> back against the cushions.
He only hoped they would continue to work: He imagined <PER>Voldemort</PER>, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate what <PER>Harry</PER> visualized as a great transparent bubble.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs off the sofa; <PER>Harry</PER> needed to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s own eyes before He would believe that He was alive.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into a hug that nearly cracked <PER>Harry</PER>'s newly repaired ribs.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?” “I don’t know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
A mixture of fear and guilt gripped <PER>Harry</PER> at the sight of their expressions; if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all <PER>Harry</PER>'s fault.
<PER>Harry</PER> had consented to the plan, given them <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack, swung it onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, where’s Hedwig?” “She She got hit,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The realization crashed over <PER>Harry</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> felt ashamed of <PER>Harry</PER> as the tears stung <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward, <PER>Harry</PER> was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, <PER>Harry</PER>'s finger glued to the Portkey as he and <PER>Hagrid</PER> hurtled away from Mister Tonks.
Seconds later <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet slammed onto hard ground and <PER>Harry</PER> fell onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow.
Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, <PER>Harry</PER> stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Molly and <PER>Ginny</PER> running down the steps by the back door as <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“We were surrounded the moment We took off — they knew it was tonight — I don’t know what happened to anyone else, four of they chased We, it was all We could do to get away, and then <PER>Voldemort</PER> caught up with We — ” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Voldemort</PER> could hear the self-justifying note in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s voice, the plea for her to understand why <PER>Voldemort</PER> did not know what had happened to her sons, but — “Thank goodness you’re all right,” her said, pulling him into a hug him did not feel him deserved.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> answered <PER>Harry</PER>'s unspoken plea for information at once.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks should have been back first, but <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks missed <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks's Portkey, it came back without them,” Portkey said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby.
As the lamplight fell across George’s head, <PER>Ginny</PER> gasped and <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach lurched: One of George’s ears was missing.
No sooner had Molly bent over Molly's son than Lupin grabbed <PER>Harry</PER> by the upper arm and dragged <PER>Harry</PER>, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where <PER>Hagrid</PER> was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door.
“What creature sat in the corner the first time that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter said, giving <PER>Harry</PER> a small shake.
“The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.” “None of the Order would have told <PER>Voldemort</PER> we were moving tonight,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The idea was dreadful to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER> could not believe it of any of them.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> only caught up with me toward the end, <PER>Voldemort</PER> didn’t know which one I was in the beginning.
Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at <PER>Harry</PER> for wanting to teach <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army how to Disarm.
“That’s <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s job.” Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, <PER>Hagrid</PER> staggered to a chair and sat down; a chair collapsed beneath him.
Lupin dived for the back door; <PER>Harry</PER> leapt over <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s legs and sprinted into the yard.
Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as <PER>Harry</PER> ran toward Two figures he realized Two figures were <PER>Hermione</PER>, now returning to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger.
<PER>Hermione</PER> flung <PER>Hermione</PER> into <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them.
Over <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulder <PER>Harry</PER> saw him raise him's wand and point it at Lupin’s chest.
“The last words Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke to the pair of us?” “ ‘<PER>Harry</PER> is the best hope we have.
“Who else is back?” “Only <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, George, and me.” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Hermione</PER> stifled a little moan behind her hand.
“Followed by five, injured two, might’ve killed one,” Kingsley reeled off, “and we saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> as well, <PER>Voldemort</PER> joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly.
“I saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> too, <PER>Voldemort</PER> came after <PER>Hagrid</PER> and me.” “So that’s why he left, to follow you!” said Kingsley.
“ <PER>Snape</PER> ?” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, give us a hand!” called <PER>Hagrid</PER> hoarsely from the door, in which <PER>Harry</PER> was stuck again.
Glad of something to do, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> free, then headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Molly and <PER>Ginny</PER> were still tending to George.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> and Kingsley,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
They looked at each other; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to hug her, hold on to her; <PER>Harry</PER> did not even care much that Molly was there, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, now back off if you know what’s good for you!” <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard Arthur shout like that before.
<PER>Harry</PER> burst into the living room, <PER>Harry</PER>'s bald patch gleaming with sweat, <PER>Harry</PER>'s spectacles askew, Fred right behind Fred, both pale but uninjured.
“Hi, <PER>Harry</PER> — you are <PER>Harry</PER>, right?” “Yeah, I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, moving closer to the sofa.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ginny</PER> and motioned to her to accompany him back outside.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks, seeming to crawl over <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks's skin, throbbing in <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks's chest, clogging <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks's throat.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence.
None <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling of them looked around when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> joined <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>'s silent vigil.
<PER>Ron</PER> tripped dazedly toward <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“So what happened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turning to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Kingsley.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow’s boundaries.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though something inside <PER>Harry</PER> was falling, falling through the earth, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> forever.
Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief: Tonks had been close to Mad-Eye, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, <PER>Harry</PER>'s favorite and <PER>Harry</PER>'s protegee at the Ministry of Magic.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had just risked his own life to save <PER>Harry</PER>’s — <PER>Hagrid</PER>, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into giving <PER>Voldemort</PER> crucial information in exchange for a dragon’s egg.
“No,” <PER>Harry</PER> said aloud, and they all looked at <PER>Harry</PER>, surprised: The firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No, I think you’re like James,” said Lupin, “who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.” <PER>Harry</PER> knew what Lupin was getting at: that <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had been betrayed by his father's friend, Peter Pettigrew.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from <PER>Harry</PER>, set down <PER>Harry</PER>'s glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, “There’s work to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “I know that — ” “Mad-Eye wouldn’t want — ” “I KNOW!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what they had done for <PER>Harry</PER>, didn’t they understand that it was for precisely that reason that He wanted to go now, before they had to suffer any more on He's behalf?
“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, but my wand spun in my hand and found <PER>Voldemort</PER> and shot a spell at <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at the gate overgrown plants, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s pounding forehead and thinking of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have believed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew it.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have known how and why <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had acted independently, because <PER>Dumbledore</PER> always had the answers; <PER>Harry</PER> had known about wands, had explained to <PER>Harry</PER> the strange connection that existed between <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s.
But <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s parents, like <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s poor owl, all were gone where <PER>Harry</PER> could never talk to them again.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a burning in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling And then, out of nowhere, the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar peaked.
It was several moments before he realized that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were at his side.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come back in the house,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“You aren’t still thinking of leaving?” “Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, thumping <PER>Harry</PER> on the back.
“Are you all right?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, close enough now to look into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding world!
<PER>Harry</PER> felt that nothing but action would assuage <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.
“I think <PER>Hermione</PER>’s been doing a bit of research,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Molly had gone upstairs to wake <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.
“It’s one extra day,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> looked mutinous.
Shortly before lunch, Molly detached <PER>Harry</PER> from the others by asking <PER>Harry</PER> to help identify a lone man’s sock that she thought might have come out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone.
“Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left me stuff to do,” mumbled <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> know about it, and they want to come too.” “What sort of ‘stuff’?” “I’m sorry, I can’t — ” “Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I’m sure Mister and Mistress Granger would agree!” said Molly.
<PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> to look directly into her eyes, noticing as <PER>Harry</PER> did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as <PER>Ginny</PER>’s.
From that moment on, Molly kept <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think.
All the jobs her handed out seemed to keep <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> away from one another; <PER>Harry</PER> had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night, when <PER>Harry</PER> had told them about <PER>Voldemort</PER> torturing Ollivander.
“I think Mum thinks that if Mum can stop the three of you getting together and planning, Mum’ll be able to delay you leaving,” <PER>Ginny</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stay.
“Someone else might kill off <PER>Voldemort</PER> while she’s holding us here making vol-au- vents?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> had spoken without thinking, and saw <PER>Ginny</PER>’s face whiten.
Suddenly <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that this was the first time that <PER>Harry</PER> had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds.
Arthur had explained that after the death of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had confided Grimmauld Place’s location had become a Secret- Keeper in turn.
“Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against <PER>Snape</PER> in case <PER>Snape</PER> turns up there again.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> crammed beside <PER>Ginny</PER>; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made <PER>Harry</PER> wish them had been separated by a few more people.
<PER>Harry</PER> was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm <PER>Harry</PER> could barely cut <PER>Harry</PER>'s chicken.
“Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ’ave ’ad champagne.” From this, <PER>Harry</PER> gathered that she still suspected <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Now, <PER>Ron</PER>, have you cleaned out your room yet?” “ Why?” exclaimed <PER>Ron</PER>, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother.
“I can help, some of it’s my mess,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER>, but Molly cut across him.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the chickens, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they’re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.” But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens.
The room was just as messy as The room had been all week; the only change was that <PER>Hermione</PER> was now sitting in the far corner, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, sorting books, some of which <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, into two enormous piles.
“And how did you manage to get away?” “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>’s mum forgot that she asked <PER>Ginny</PER> and me to change the sheets yesterday,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I wasn’t trying to upset — ” But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, <PER>Ron</PER> bounded off the bed and got there first.
Looking rather pleased with himself, <PER>Ron</PER> handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But you know what he’d say to us if he was here?” “ ‘C-constant vigilance,’ ” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, mopping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried as <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched the book from <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg and retied it shut.
“I forgot we’ll be hunting down <PER>Voldemort</PER> in a mobile library.” “Ha ha,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking down at Spellman’s Syllabary.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at He with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance.
“I know you said after <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s funeral that you wanted to come with me,” <PER>Harry</PER> began.
“Here he goes,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER>, rolling his eyes.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, you listen,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> got back off the bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at <PER>Harry</PER> as though reproaching <PER>Harry</PER> for lack of tact.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for <PER>Ron</PER> to be teaching anyone else tact.
“I — <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’m sorry — I didn’t — ” “Didn’t realize that <PER>Ron</PER> and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you?
“C’mon.” “Why?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, following <PER>Ron</PER> out of the room onto the tiny landing.
“Come and have a look at him.” <PER>Harry</PER> followed <PER>Ron</PER> up the few short steps into the tiny attic space.
<PER>Harry</PER> head and shoulders were in the room before <PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from <PER>Harry</PER>, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open.
It was human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now that <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of <PER>Ron</PER>’s pajamas.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s me, see?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
They climbed back down the ladder, which <PER>Ron</PER> returned to the ceiling, and rejoined <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was still sorting books.
“It is!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, clearly frustrated that <PER>Harry</PER> had not grasped the brilliance of the plan.
<PER>Ron</PER> sat watching her, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked from one to the other, unable to say anything.
The measures they had taken to protect their families made <PER>Harry</PER> realize, more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with <PER>Harry</PER> and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.” “Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she’s too young to come on shis own,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee.
Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, <PER>Harry</PER> was drawn to the place where it had happened, wanting to understand.
“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s keeping a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked.
“He said in He's note he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?” <PER>Harry</PER> dragged <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack toward <PER>Harry</PER> and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.
“Whichever,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “it’d be one less for us to do!” “Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren’t we?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “to find out whether or not it’s destroyed.” “And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “I’ve been researching that.” “How?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> removed them all, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t destroy them all.” <PER>Ron</PER> sat up straight, wide-eyed.
“How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?” “It — it wasn’t stealing!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER> with a kind of desperation.
“Just after his — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s — funeral,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in an even smaller voice.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sure <PER>Riddle</PER> already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; <PER>Ron</PER> jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and <PER>Harry</PER> instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that his was looking up at Molly, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage.
“I’m sure you all need your rest but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.” “Oh yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking terrified as <PER>Hermione</PER> leapt to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, sending books flying in every direction, “we will we’re sorry ” With an anguished look at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried out of the room after Molly.
“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained <PER>Ron</PER> in an undertone, still massaging his head as his and <PER>Harry</PER> followed.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur’s family by this time, and it was with ill grace that <PER>Ron</PER> stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and <PER>Harry</PER> attempted to flatten <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair.
Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house.
“Oi, wake up.” <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
“I think <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s looking for <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” “Poor bloke,” said <PER>Ron</PER> fervently.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat up, still rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar, now wide awake.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to remember exactly what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley.
“I think <PER>Harry</PER>’s abroad.” “Who, Gregorovitch?” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Do me a favor and don’t tell <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Reveling in the removal of his Trace, <PER>Harry</PER> sent <PER>Ron</PER>’s possessions flying around the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage.
<PER>Harry</PER> also tried tying the laces of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on <PER>Ron</PER>’s Chudley Cannons posters bright blue.
“I’d do your fly by hand, though,” <PER>Ron</PER> advised <PER>Harry</PER>, sniggering when <PER>Harry</PER> immediately checked it.
“I’m afraid that one isn’t new like <PER>Ron</PER>’s, it was actually my brother Fabian’s and he wasn’t terribly careful with his possessions, it’s a bit dented on the back, but — ” The rest of her speech was lost; <PER>Harry</PER> had got up and hugged her.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted <PER>Harry</PER>'s cheek clumsily when <PER>Harry</PER> released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor.
“Happy birthday, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, hurrying into the kitchen and adding <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own present to the top of the pile.
“Come on, then, open <PER>Hermione</PER>’s!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded.
“I’ll pack these for you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said brightly, taking <PER>Harry</PER>’s presents out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms as the three of them headed back upstairs.
“I’m nearly done, I’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER>’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, will you come in here a moment?” It was <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> came to an abrupt halt, but <PER>Hermione</PER> took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs.
Feeling nervous, <PER>Harry</PER> followed <PER>Ginny</PER> into her room.
A desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and <PER>Ginny</PER> had once played two-a-side Quidditch with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee.
<PER>Ginny</PER> looked up into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, took a deep breath, and said, “Happy seventeenth.” “Yeah thanks.” <PER>Ginny</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER> steadily; <PER>Harry</PER>, however, found it difficult to look back at <PER>Ginny</PER>; it was like gazing into a brilliant light.
“So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing whatever you’re doing.” “I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest.” “There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” She whispered, and then She was kissing him as She had never kissed him before, and <PER>Harry</PER> was kissing Shis back, and it was blissful oblivion, better than firewhisky; She was the only real thing in the world, <PER>Ginny</PER>, the feel of She, one hand at Shis back and one in Shis long, sweet-smelling hair — The door banged open behind them and them jumped apart.
“Sorry.” “<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was just behind him, slightly out of breath.
There was a strained silence, then <PER>Ginny</PER> said in a flat little voice, “Well, happy birthday anyway, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears were scarlet; <PER>Hermione</PER> looked nervous.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s shining moment had popped like a soap bubble.
All the reasons for ending his relationship with <PER>Ginny</PER>, for staying well away from <PER>Ginny</PER>, seemed to have slunk inside the room with <PER>Ron</PER>, and all happy forgetfulness was gone.
<PER>Ron</PER> marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and <PER>Harry</PER> kept pace with him all the way, <PER>Hermione</PER> trotting along behind them looking scared.
Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, <PER>Ron</PER> rounded on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — ” But <PER>Ron</PER> held up a hand to silence her.
“Okay?” <PER>Ron</PER> looked half resentful, half sheepish; <PER>Harry</PER> rocked backward and forward on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet for a moment, then said, “Right then, well, that’s yeah.” <PER>Ginny</PER> did not seek another one-to-one meeting with <PER>Harry</PER> for the rest of the day, nor by any look or gesture did <PER>Ginny</PER> show that they had shared more than polite conversation in <PER>Ginny</PER>'s room.
As <PER>Harry</PER>’s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow’s kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, several tables were placed end to end in the garden.
Thanks to Molly’s ministrations, George’s wound was neat and clean, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, despite the twins’ many jokes about it.
<PER>Hermione</PER> made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes.
“Nice,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, as with one final flourish of her wand, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold.
“You’ve really got an eye for that sort of thing.” “Thank you, <PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking both pleased and a little confused.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned away, smiling to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a funny notion that <PER>Harry</PER> would find a chapter on compliments when <PER>Harry</PER> found time to peruse <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; <PER>Harry</PER> caught <PER>Ginny</PER>’s eye and grinned at <PER>Ginny</PER>'s before remembering his promise to <PER>Ron</PER> and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour.
Seconds later <PER>Harry</PER> realized that it was <PER>Harry</PER>'s birthday cake, which Molly was suspending with Molly's wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground.
Over ” Molly's shoulder, <PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one.
Although Lupin smiled as he shook <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> looked rather unhappy.
“Six years ter the day since we met, <PER>Harry</PER>, d’yeh remember it?” “Vaguely,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Didn’t you smash down the front door, give <PER>Dudley</PER> a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?” “I forge’ the details,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> chortled.
“All righ’, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “We’re fine,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Here, <PER>Harry</PER> — couldn’ think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck.
As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy and grim.
“Also with Mister <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley and Miss <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.” “Us?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding surprised.
“There will be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur.” <PER>Harry</PER> saw Arthur exchange a worried look with Molly as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood up.
As they led the way back to the house in silence, <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the other two were thinking the same as <PER>Harry</PER> was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts.
Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in here: <PER>Harry</PER> flicked <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the oil lamps as <PER>Harry</PER> entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room.
Scrimgeour sat Scrimgeour in the sagging armchair that Arthur normally occupied, leaving <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> to squeeze side by side onto the sofa.
“I am here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s will.” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at one another.
“Me and <PER>Hermione</PER> too?” “Yes, all of—” But <PER>Harry</PER> interrupted.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was very fond of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as <PER>Harry</PER> knew, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been negligible.
Scrimgeour put Scrimgeour's hand inside Scrimgeour's cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER>.
After squinting at <PER>Ron</PER> for a moment or two, he turned back to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s will.
<PER>Hermione</PER> held the book in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lap and gazed at it.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw that the title was in runes; <PER>Harry</PER> had never learned to read them.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew I liked books,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a thick voice, mopping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s sleeve.
They were wedged together so tightly that <PER>Ron</PER> had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulders.
“ ‘To <PER>Harry</PER> James Potter,’ ” he read, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides contracted with a sudden excitement, “ ‘I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.’ ” As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather feebly, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, answered: <PER>Harry</PER> thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit <PER>Hermione</PER> could not suppress the urge.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together; both considered <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s Quidditch knowledge negligible.
“Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still wondering how <PER>Harry</PER> could appear to touch the Snitch the Snitch without really doing so.
If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read <PER>Hermione</PER>’s mind; <PER>Harry</PER> could practically hear <PER>Hermione</PER>'s brain whirring beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> met the Minister’s yellow eyes and knew <PER>Harry</PER> had no option but to obey.
<PER>Harry</PER> held out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and placed the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into <PER>Harry</PER>’s palm.
Scrimgeour, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> laughed.
“That’s all, then, is it?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, making to prise <PER>Hermione</PER> off the sofa.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> left you a second bequest, Potter.” “What is it?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, excitement rekindling.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both stiffened.
“That does not make it the exclusive property of Potter, whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> may have decided.” Scrimgeour scratched <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s badly shaven cheek, scrutinizing <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Why do you think “ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted to give me the sword?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, struggling to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper.
Scrimgeour limped toward <PER>Harry</PER> and jabbed <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the chest with the point of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand: It singed a hole in <PER>Harry</PER>’s T- shirt like a lit cigarette.
“Oi!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, jumping up and raising his own wand, but <PER>Harry</PER> said, “No!
Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from <PER>Harry</PER>, glancing at the hole he had made in <PER>Harry</PER>’s T-shirt.
After a minute or so she called, “He’s gone!” “What did he want?” Arthur asked, looking around at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> as Molly came hurrying back to them.
“To give us what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have left <PER>Harry</PER> an old Snitch.
“Meet us upstairs,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to <PER>Hermione</PER>, while they helped Molly restore the garden to its normal state.
“After everyone’s gone to bed.” Up in the attic room, <PER>Ron</PER> examined his Deluminator, and <PER>Harry</PER> filled <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder’s Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.’s locket.
“ Muffliato,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, waving <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand in the direction of the stairs.
“And from what they said, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> invented it <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!” “D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he’d left us?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“When Scrimgeour made you take it, <PER>Harry</PER>, I was so sure that something was going to happen!” “Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s pulse quickening as <PER>Harry</PER> raised the Snitch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, gasped, pointing frantically from <PER>Harry</PER> to the Snitch and back again until <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
“That was the one you nearly swallowed!” “Exactly,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and with <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch.
Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanting handwriting that <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s: I open at the close.
“ ‘I open at the close ’ What’s that supposed to mean?” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> shook their heads, looking blank.
“Why did he want <PER>Harry</PER> to have the sword?” “And why couldn’t he just have told me?” <PER>Harry</PER> said quietly.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> expected <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to understand?
“And as for this book,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “The Tales of Beedle the Bard I’ve never even heard of them!” “You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” said <PER>Ron</PER> incredulously.
The circumstance of <PER>Ron</PER> having read a book that <PER>Hermione</PER> had not was unprecedented.
“You must’ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty “<PER>Ron</PER>, you know full well <PER>Harry</PER> and I were brought up by Muggles!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Three o’clock on the following afternoon found <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests.
The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer’s day.
George was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and <PER>Ron</PER> took charge of Arthur’s old Ministry colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to <PER>Harry</PER>’s lot.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: <PER>Hagrid</PER> was causing a certain amount of disruption.
While Arthur repaired the damage and <PER>Hagrid</PER> shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried back to the entrance to find <PER>Ron</PER> face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking wizard.
Slightly cross- eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss, <PER>Harry</PER> wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow.
“<PER>Ron</PER> can laugh,” said Luna serenely as <PER>Harry</PER> led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, “but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.” “Really?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father’s peculiar views.
“You look great!” “Always the tone of surprise,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> smiled.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high heels; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair was sleek and shiny.
“he used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his — ” “Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, while <PER>Harry</PER> roared with laughter.
They were all laughing so much that none of They noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to <PER>Ron</PER> and said, with his eyes on <PER>Hermione</PER>, “You look vunderful.” “Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped shis small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then, feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from <PER>Ron</PER>’s vicinity, offered to show him him's seat.
<PER>Harry</PER> appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: <PER>Harry</PER> was, after all, a famous Quidditch player.
While people were still craning people's necks to get a good look at him, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle.
“Time to sit down,” Fred told <PER>Harry</PER>, “or we’re going to get run over by the bride.” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather pink and <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears were still scarlet.
After a few moments he muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, “Did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard?” <PER>Harry</PER> gave a noncommittal grunt.
“Ooooh!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, swiveling around in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s seat to look at the entrance.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s funeral, now standing in front of Bill and Fleur.
“But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.” <PER>Ginny</PER> glanced around, grinning, winked at <PER>Harry</PER>, then quickly faced the front again.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with <PER>Ginny</PER> in lonely parts of the school grounds.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned and beamed at <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes too were full of tears. "
“Well have time later,” shrugged <PER>Ron</PER>, snatching three butter-beers from a passing tray and handing one to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught <PER>Harry</PER> instead.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked pleasurably flustered, but this time Viktor Krum had not come to compliment <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Krum did not seem to know whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> was making fun of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Gregorovitch!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, and Krum started, but <PER>Harry</PER> was too excited to care; the memory had come back to <PER>Harry</PER> at the sight of Krum’s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tournament.
So <PER>Voldemort</PER> was looking for a celebrated wandmaker, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not have to search far for a reason: It was surely because of what <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had done on the night that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had pursued him across the skies.
“This girl is very nice-looking,” Krum said, recalling <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surroundings.
“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, “is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?” And he strode off, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make <PER>Harry</PER>'s way around the edge of the crowded dance floor.
he wanted to find <PER>Ron</PER>, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but <PER>Ron</PER> was dancing with <PER>Hermione</PER> out in the middle of the floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was now dancing with Fred and George’s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given <PER>Ron</PER>.
Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of <PER>Ron</PER>’s who seemed unsure whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> was <PER>Harry</PER>'s son, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table.
<PER>Harry</PER> cloud of white hair made <PER>Harry</PER> look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez.
<PER>Harry</PER> was vaguely familiar: Racking <PER>Harry</PER>'s brains, <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s obituary.
“Certainly I knew him longest, if you don’t count Aberforth — and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.” “Speaking of the Daily Prophet I don’t know whether you saw, Mister Doge — ?” “Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.” “Elphias, I don’t know whether you saw the interview <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter gave about Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” Doge’s face flooded with angry color.
Perhaps Doge suspected <PER>Harry</PER>’s feelings, for <PER>Harry</PER> looked concerned and hurried on, “<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter is a dreadful — ” But <PER>Harry</PER> was interrupted by a shrill cackle.
“I assure you I was writing from the heart.” “Oh, we all know you worshipped <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; I daresay you’ll still think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was a saint even if it does turn out that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did away with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s Squib sister!” “Muriell” exclaimed Doge.
“Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second class; but naturally Kendra <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t have dreamed of letting Kendra <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s daughter go to a Muggle school — ” “Ariana was delicate!” said Doge desperately.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s sister suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s sister's lack of magic?
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what to think, what to believe: <PER>Harry</PER> wanted the truth, and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story.
Never once, in six years, had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric’s Hollow.
And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never once told <PER>Harry</PER> never bothered to say And why it was so important, <PER>Harry</PER> could not explain even to <PER>Harry</PER>, yet <PER>Harry</PER> felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell <PER>Harry</PER> that they had this place and these experiences in common.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around <PER>Harry</PER>, and did not realize that <PER>Hermione</PER> had appeared out of the crowd until <PER>Hermione</PER> drew up a chair beside him.
“I simply can’t dance anymore,” <PER>Hermione</PER> panted, slipping off one of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoes and rubbing the sole of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s foot.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, are you okay?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know where to begin, but it did not matter.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet and drew <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wands.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> into the panicking crowd.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, where are you?” As they pushed their way across the dance floor, <PER>Harry</PER> saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd; then <PER>Harry</PER> saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of their shout, “Protego\”, a cry that was echoed on all sides — “<PER>Ron</PER>!
<PER>Harry</PER> caught hold of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s free arm, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all him could feel was <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand as <PER>Harry</PER> was squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were still wearing dress robes.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, we haven’t got anything to change into,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him.
“Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, inwardly cursing <PER>Harry</PER>'s own stupidity.
“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, frowning at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which her was now rummaging.
“Yes, they’re here,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s utter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.
“Thank you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, managing a small smile as <PER>Hermione</PER> pushed the robes into the bag.
“Please, <PER>Harry</PER>, get that Cloak on!” <PER>Harry</PER> threw the Invisibility Cloak around <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders and pulled his shoulders up over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, vanishing from sight.
“It’s you they’re after, <PER>Harry</PER>, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.” “She’s right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who seemed to know that <PER>Harry</PER> was about to argue, even if <PER>Harry</PER> could not see <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after everyone.” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded, then remembered that they could not see <PER>Harry</PER>, and said, “Yeah.” But <PER>Harry</PER> thought of <PER>Ginny</PER>, and fear bubbled like acid in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m sure we’re safer out in the Muggle world, it’s not where they’ll expect us to be.” “True,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking around, “but don’t you feel a bit — exposed?” “Where else is there?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, cringing as the men on the other side of the road started wolf- whistling at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped into a booth first and <PER>Ron</PER> sat next to <PER>Harry</PER> opposite <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: She glanced over her shoulder so frequently She appeared to have a twitch.
After a minute or two, <PER>Ron</PER> said, “You know, we’re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing Cross — ” “<PER>Ron</PER>, we can’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and <PER>Hermione</PER> ordered two cappuccinos: As <PER>Harry</PER> was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one.
<PER>Hermione</PER> dropped <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice to a whisper.
The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that <PER>Harry</PER> came to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, waved her away.
<PER>Ron</PER>, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing <PER>Hermione</PER> sideways onto her bench.
The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the tiled wall where <PER>Ron</PER>’s head had just been, as <PER>Harry</PER>, still invisible, yelled, “Stupefyl” The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: The great blond Death Eater slumped sideways, unconscious.
His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at <PER>Ron</PER>: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound <PER>Ron</PER> head to foot — the waitress screamed and ran for the door — <PER>Harry</PER> sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up <PER>Ron</PER>, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door.
“Expulsol” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which <PER>Harry</PER> was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed <PER>Harry</PER> into the wall and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand leave <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand as the Cloak slipped off him.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench.
him turned over the darker Death Eater with him's foot; the man’s eyes moved rapidly between <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Lock the door,” he told her, “and <PER>Ron</PER>, turn out the lights.” he looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and <PER>Ron</PER> used the Deluminator to plunge the cafe into darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the men who had jeered at <PER>Hermione</PER> earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance.
“What are we going to do with them?” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER> through the dark; then, even more quietly, “Kill them?
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“Take care of the other one and the waitress while <PER>Ron</PER> and I clear up.” “Clear up?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking around at the partly destroyed cafe.
“It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, <PER>Hermione</PER>, you packed my old jeans, they’re tight.” “Oh, I’m so sorry,” hissed <PER>Hermione</PER>, and as <PER>Hermione</PER> dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mutter a suggestion as to where <PER>Ron</PER> could stick his wand instead.
“How did they know where we were?” <PER>Hermione</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You — you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “<PER>Harry</PER> can’t have,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Don’t be silly, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER> can get in there!” “<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him — and even if they haven’t worked,” <PER>Ron</PER>’s dad pressed on as <PER>Hermione</PER> began to argue, “so what?
Then, on <PER>Harry</PER>’s count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more.
Seconds later <PER>Harry</PER>’s lungs expanded gratefully and <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square.
They raced up the stone steps, and <PER>Harry</PER> tapped the front door once with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“So where are these jinxes they put up against <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> took a step forward.
“We’re not <PER>Snape</PER>!” croaked <PER>Harry</PER>, before something whooshed over <PER>Harry</PER> like cold air and <PER>Harry</PER>'s tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak.
<PER>Ron</PER> was making retching noises; <PER>Hermione</PER> stammered, “That m-must have b- been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for <PER>Snape</PER>!” Gingerly <PER>Harry</PER> took another step forward.
Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible: <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed and so did Mistress Black, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, the gray figure face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, the gray figure raised a wasted arm, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, and though <PER>Harry</PER> had raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand no spell occurred to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers — ” “SHUT UP!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, directing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her.
“That that was ” <PER>Hermione</PER> whimpered, as <PER>Ron</PER> helped her to her feet.
“Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand and said, “Homenum revelio.” Nothing happened.
“Let’s go up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a frightened look at the same spot, and <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor.
<PER>Hermione</PER> waved <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drafty room, <PER>Hermione</PER> perched on the sofa, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arms wrapped tightly around <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And you’d think, if <PER>Harry</PER> still had a Trace on <PER>Harry</PER>, they’d have followed us here.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not <PER>Harry</PER>'s own pound through <PER>Harry</PER>'s body, violent and brief as an electric shock.
“What did you see?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked, advancing on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Did you see <PER>Harry</PER> at my place?” “No, I just felt anger — <PER>Harry</PER>’s really angry — ” “But that could be at the Burrow,” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t want you to use that connection, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted you to shut that connection down, that’s why you were supposed to use Occlumency!
He wished that He had not told them what He had seen and felt; it made <PER>Voldemort</PER> more threatening, as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar was building and <PER>Voldemort</PER> fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick.
He turned He's back on <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> shrieked: <PER>Harry</PER> drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of <PER>Ron</PER>’s father.
<PER>Ron</PER> let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: <PER>Hermione</PER> joined him, gripping him's arm.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” he said over <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder, “I — ” “It’s not a problem,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sickened by the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt sickened by what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, by the use to which <PER>Malfoy</PER> was now being put by <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
There was a sharp rap on the door, and <PER>Harry</PER> jumped as <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice rang out.
A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains: It was the cool, clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s slow, deep breathing.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that <PER>Hermione</PER> sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> The grief that had possessed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> since <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s death felt different now.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> been like <PER>Dudley</PER>, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him?
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of Godric’s Hollow, of graves <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never mentioned there; <PER>Harry</PER> thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s will, and resentment swelled in the darkness.
Why hadn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told n’t graves <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> actually cared about <PER>Harry</PER> at all?
Desperate for something to do, for distraction, <PER>Harry</PER> slipped out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleeping bag, picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and crept out of the room.
<PER>Harry</PER> continued up the stairs until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the topmost landing, where there were only two doors.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never entered <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather’s bedroom before.
A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed’s headboard; a spider’s web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as <PER>Harry</PER> moved deeper into the room, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a scurrying of disturbed mice.
<PER>Harry</PER> could only assume that Sirius’s parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept Sirius’s parents on the wall, because <PER>Harry</PER> was sure Siriusparents would not have appreciated Sirius’s parents's eldest son’s taste in decoration.
There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (<PER>Harry</PER> had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper.
With a leap of pleasure, <PER>Harry</PER> recognized <PER>Harry</PER>'s father; <PER>Harry</PER>'s untidy black hair stuck up at the back like <PER>Harry</PER>’s, and <PER>Harry</PER> too wore glasses.
Beside <PER>Harry</PER> was Sirius, carelessly handsome, him's slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen it alive.
On James’s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding he liked and included or was it simply because <PER>Harry</PER> knew how it had been, that <PER>Harry</PER> saw these things in the picture?
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to take it from the wall; it was <PER>Harry</PER>'s now, after all, Sirius had left <PER>Harry</PER> everything, but it would not budge.
We were so sorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s got to come first, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s not old enough to know it’s <PER>Harry</PER>’s's birthday anyway!
James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, James tries not to show it but I can tell — also, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s still got <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions.
Bathilda drops in most days, Bathilda’s a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I’m not sure <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d be pleased if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew!
I don’t know how much to believe, actually, because it seems incredible that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s extremities seemed to have gone numb.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s stood quite still, holding the miraculous paper in <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s's nerveless fingers while inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s a kind of quiet eruption sent joy and grief thundering in equal measure through <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s's veins.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused, pondering <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s words.
<PER>Harry</PER> distinctly remembered <PER>Harry</PER>'s headmaster telling <PER>Harry</PER> years before, “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible.” Perhaps some less gifted Order member had needed Order assistance, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had acted as carrier?
It seems incredible that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — That <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what?
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized papers, treating them, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher; <PER>Harry</PER> pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair.
<PER>Harry</PER> tucked the photograph into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket with Lily’s letter and continued to look for the second sheet.
After another quarter of an hour, however, <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to conclude that the rest of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s letter was gone.
<PER>Hermione</PER> took it and read it while <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Hermione</PER>.
When <PER>Hermione</PER> reached the end of the page <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up at him.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> ” “And there’s this too.” He handed her the torn photograph, and <PER>Hermione</PER> smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom.
“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “but it’s not here.” <PER>Hermione</PER> glanced around.
“I understand why you’d love to talk to her about your mum and dad, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> too,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But that wouldn’t really help us in us search for the Horcruxes, would it?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer, and she rushed on, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I know you really want to go to Godric’s Hollow, but I’m scared, I’m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday.
When he had finished, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Of course, I can see why that’s upset you, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not it’s true or — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter?
She read it, then clutched <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so tightly that <PER>Harry</PER> winced.
“He was a Death Eater,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “Sirius told me about He, He joined up when He was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they killed He.” “That fits!” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“If he was a Death Eater he had access to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring <PER>Voldemort</PER> down!” She released <PER>Harry</PER>, leaned over the banister, and screamed, “<PER>Ron</PER>!
<PER>Hermione</PER> pointed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at the handle and said, “Alohomora.” There was a click, and the door swung open.
“What?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely; <PER>Hermione</PER> was still immersed in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s press clippings.
“He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s where the Seeker Never mind,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, realizing that nobody was listening: <PER>Ron</PER> was on his hands and knees, searching under the wardrobe.
“There’s an easier way,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> wiped <PER>Harry</PER>'s inky fingers on <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans.
“Charms to prevent it being summoned magically, you know.” “Like <PER>Voldemort</PER> put on the stone basin in the cave,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, remembering how <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been unable to Summon the fake locket.
“It could be somewhere else in the house, though,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs: As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had become more discouraged, she seemed to have become more determined.
“There was a locket.” “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
<PER>Ron</PER> groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; <PER>Hermione</PER> closed her eyes.
“It’s not over yet,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice and called, “ Kreacherl” There was a loud crack and the house-elf that <PER>Harry</PER> had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half human-sized, <PER>Harry</PER>'s pale skin hanging off <PER>Harry</PER> in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from <PER>Harry</PER>'s batlike ears.
“Two years ago,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart now hammering against <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs, “there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs.
Then he said, “Yes.” “Where is it now?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> jubilantly as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked gleeful.
“Gone.” “Gone?” echoed <PER>Harry</PER>, elation flooding out of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ — and the locket, Master Regulus’s locket, Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!” <PER>Harry</PER> reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, <PER>Harry</PER> launched <PER>Harry</PER> upon the elf, flattening <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s scream mingled with Kreacher’s, but <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed louder than both of them: “Kreacher, I order you to stay still!” <PER>Harry</PER> felt the elf freeze and released <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let him up!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“So <PER>Harry</PER> can beat <PER>Harry</PER> up with the poker?” snorted <PER>Harry</PER>, kneeling beside the elf.
he said that <PER>Voldemort</PER> required an elf.” “<PER>Voldemort</PER> needed an elf?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, looking around at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked just as puzzled as <PER>Harry</PER> did.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> saw what had happened as clearly as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been present. "
But here, <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination could go no further, for <PER>Harry</PER> could not see how Kreacher had escaped.
Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked at <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s great, bloodshot eyes.
“I know, but — ” “Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“He Disapparated!” “But you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that cave,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “otherwise <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ” “Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
But even as <PER>Voldemort</PER> thought this, <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice was icy.
“Of course, <PER>Voldemort</PER> would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s notice, just like all the purebloods who treat them like animals.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s hands leapt to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth: <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have understood something.
“So you brought the locket home,” <PER>Harry</PER> said relentlessly, for <PER>Harry</PER> was determined to know the full story.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s heels and shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, trying to clear it.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring <PER>Voldemort</PER> down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to <PER>Voldemort</PER>?
““<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what <PER>Voldemort</PER> did to Kreacher wasn’t that far out of the common way.
As <PER>Voldemort</PER> watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, <PER>Voldemort</PER> remembered what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, mere hours after Sirius’s death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Hermione</PER> for assistance.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, <PER>Harry</PER> could not pretend that it was not an order.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
he then made two low bows to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, and even gave a funny little spasm in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.
If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, <PER>Harry</PER> was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and <PER>Harry</PER> prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation.
By nightfall, <PER>Harry</PER> felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which <PER>Hermione</PER> had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help.
“Death Eaters, for sure,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, as he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched from the drawing room windows.
“Reckon they know we’re in here?” “I don’t think so,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> looked frightened, “or they’d have sent <PER>Snape</PER> in after we, wouldn’t they?” “D’you reckon “D’you’s been in here and had “D’you's tongue tied by Moody’s curse?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
Restless and irritable, <PER>Ron</PER> had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket: This particularly infuriated <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off.
“I don’t know I’m doing it!” “Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?” “What, like reading kids’ stories?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> left me this book, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “ — and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use it!” Unable to stand the bickering, <PER>Harry</PER> slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them.
<PER>Harry</PER> headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which <PER>Harry</PER> kept visiting because <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear.
Every nerve in <PER>Harry</PER>'s body seemed to tauten: <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited.
<PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand into the middle of it.
“Don’t move!” He had forgotten the portrait of Mistress Black: At the sound of He's yell, the curtains hiding her flew open and her began to scream, “Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house — ” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> came crashing down the stairs behind <PER>Harry</PER>, wands pointing, like <PER>Harry</PER>, at the unknown man now standing with <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms raised in the hall below.
“Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!” “Oh, thank goodness,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> weakly, pointing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at Mistress Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell.
<PER>Ron</PER> too lowered his wand, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not.
“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, <PER>Harry</PER>, which takes the form of a stag.” “Oh, all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, lowering <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, “but I had to check, didn’t I?” “Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to check.
“We wondered,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively, “whether <PER>Harry</PER> could still have the Trace on <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Impossible,” said Lupin.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked smug, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt hugely relieved.
“Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure <PER>Harry</PER> was here if <PER>Harry</PER> still had the Trace on <PER>Harry</PER>, wouldn’t they?
<PER>Harry</PER> had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act had been to try to protect <PER>Harry</PER>.
He read the headline over it: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> gave roars of outrage, but <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing.
<PER>Harry</PER> pushed the newspaper away; <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to read any more: <PER>Harry</PER> knew what it would say.
Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died knew who had really killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and, as <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, <PER>Harry</PER> had been seen running from the place moments after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had fallen.
“The official version of Scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.” “Why didn’t <PER>Voldemort</PER> declare himself Minister of Magic?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.” <PER>Ron</PER> glanced at <PER>Hermione</PER>, then said, “What if purebloods and half-bloods swear a Muggle-born’s part of purebloods and half-bloods's family?
“Thank you, <PER>Ron</PER>, but I couldn’t let you — ” “You won’t have a choice,” said <PER>Ron</PER> fiercely, gripping her hand back.
“I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, <PER>Harry</PER>, but the Order is under the impression that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left you a mission.” “He did,” <PER>Harry</PER> replied, “and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> are in on it and they’re coming with me.” “Can you confide in me what the mission is?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that <PER>Harry</PER> could return a different answer.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly, “I’m not.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s eyes swiveled backward and forward from <PER>Harry</PER> to Lupin.
“Don’t say that — how could any child be ashamed of you?” “Oh, I don’t know, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’d be pretty ashamed of him.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know where <PER>Harry</PER>'s rage was coming from, but it had propelled <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet too.
“You fancy stepping into Sirius’s shoes — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” <PER>Hermione</PER> begged <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> continued to glare into Lupin’s livid face.
“The man who taught me to fight dementors — a coward.” Lupin drew The man who taught me to fight dementors's wand so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> had barely reached for <PER>Harry</PER>'s own; there was a loud bang and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> flying backward as if punched; as <PER>Harry</PER> slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed the tail of Lupin’s cloak disappearing around the door.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” wailed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood up; <PER>Harry</PER> could feel a lump swelling where <PER>Harry</PER>'s head had hit the wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still so full of anger <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking.
“No — no — we mustn’t fight!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, launching <PER>Hermione</PER> between them.
“You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>.
Broken images were racing each other through He's mind: Sirius falling through the veil; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mother’s voice, begging for mercy “Parents,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “shouldn’t leave their kids unless — unless their’ve got to.” “<PER>Harry</PER> — ” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, stretching out a consoling hand, but “<PER>Harry</PER> — ” shrugged it off and walked away, “<PER>Harry</PER> — ”'s eyes on the fire <PER>Hermione</PER> had conjured.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure that they were looking at each other behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, communicating silently.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked sympathetic, <PER>Ron</PER> uncertain.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, thinking of <PER>Harry</PER>'s father.
The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s unspoken reproaches.
He was sure that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet He turned a page loudly, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s name leapt out at He.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of photos of Native Americans <PER>Harry</PER>’d seen as <PER>Harry</PER> studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked above the picture and saw the headline: by <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter Thinking that it could hardly make <PER>Harry</PER> feel any worse than <PER>Harry</PER> already did, <PER>Harry</PER> began to read: Proud and haughty, Kendra <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her husband Percival’s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban.
She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s strange escape from <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been wrong: What <PER>Harry</PER> had read had indeed made <PER>Harry</PER> feel worse.
he was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen.
<PER>Harry</PER> immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to <PER>Harry</PER>, croaked, “Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.” Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out Mundungus's wand; <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, was too quick for Mundungus.
<PER>Ron</PER> got up, panting, and watched as <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand deliberately at Mundungus ’s nose.
“Well, you’re a bunch of bleedin’ ’eroes then, aren’t you, but I never pretended I was up for killing meself “We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad- Eye,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, moving <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand a little closer to Mundungus’s baggy, bloodshot eyes.
“When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but Mundungus interrupted <PER>Harry</PER> again.
“Perhaps just one more, Master <PER>Harry</PER>, for luck?” <PER>Ron</PER> laughed.
“Aguamenti\” screamed <PER>Hermione</PER>, and a jet of water streamed from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up and saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s own shock reflected in <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s faces.
<PER>Harry</PER> had nearly lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s balance as <PER>Harry</PER> Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of <PER>Harry</PER>'s momentarily exposed elbow.
He and <PER>Hermione</PER> had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now He and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of them's scattered parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read: “No!” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> loudly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was quickest; <PER>Hermione</PER> snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud.
“Thanks, Kreacher,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face.
“Well, at least we know exactly where <PER>Snape</PER> is now.” <PER>Snape</PER> began to spoon soup into <PER>Snape</PER>'s mouth.
He was sure <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were, or debating how best to undermine <PER>Snape</PER> ’s new regime.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was carrying a large, framed picture, which <PER>Hermione</PER> now lowered to the floor before seizing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard.
“Phineas Nigellus,” <PER>Hermione</PER> explained as <PER>Hermione</PER> threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash.
“Sorry?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> understood.
The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s office at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where <PER>Snape</PER> was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor.
“<PER>Snape</PER> could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for Phineas Nigellus,” <PER>Hermione</PER> explained to <PER>Ron</PER> as she resumed her seat.
“Thank you,” smiled <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling <PER>Hermione</PER>'s soup toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>, what else happened today?” “Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That’s why we haven’t seen <PER>Umbridge</PER>, she’d never walk, she’d think she’s too important.” “And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked.
“How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s soupspoon suspended in midair.
“Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.” “But you never told us that!” <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that her and <PER>Ron</PER> had been examining when <PER>Harry</PER> had entered the kitchen.
<PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s jaw hanging; <PER>Ron</PER> choked a little over his soup.
“You aren’t serious, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was biting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip, deep in thought.
“We know everything important,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on, addressing <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“It’s time to act.” <PER>Harry</PER> could tell from <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s faces that they were scared; <PER>Harry</PER> was not particularly confident <PER>Harry</PER>, and yet <PER>Harry</PER> was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.
“I thought we’d settled this.” “It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” <PER>Ron</PER> jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously.
“Let me know if you ever defeat <PER>Voldemort</PER>, won’t you?” As <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> laughed, pain shot through the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
<PER>Harry</PER> hand jumped to it: <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER>’s eyes narrow, and <PER>Harry</PER> tried to pass off the movement by brushing <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
“Master has not finished Master's soup, would Master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?” “Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute — er — bathroom.” Aware that <PER>Hermione</PER> was watching him suspiciously, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where <PER>Harry</PER> dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again.
Grunting with pain, <PER>Harry</PER> slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
The buildings on either side of <PER>Harry</PER> had high, timbered gables; The buildings on either side of <PER>Harry</PER> looked like gingerbread houses.
<PER>Harry</PER> approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own long-fingered hand against the door.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, open up!” <PER>Harry</PER> had shouted out, <PER>Harry</PER> knew it.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up and unbolted the door; <PER>Hermione</PER> toppled inside at once, regained <PER>Hermione</PER>'s balance, and looked around suspiciously.
<PER>Ron</PER> was right behind her, looking unnerved as <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.
“Oh yeah I must’ve dozed off or — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, please don’t insult our intelligence,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, taking deep breaths.
“So you’re not even going to try to shut <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out?” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, I can’t.
“Would you like it?” “I — no — I’m sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>, I didn’t mean — ” “I hate it, I hate the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> can get inside me, that I have to watch <PER>Harry</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER>’s most dangerous.
“He made Krum’s wand and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.” “But according to you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s got Ollivander locked up somewhere.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you keep talking about what your wand did,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but you made it happen!
As his extinguished his wand, however, his was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; his thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long his could hope to remain hidden while <PER>Voldemort</PER> sought <PER>Voldemort</PER> so determinedly.
“You look terrible,” was <PER>Ron</PER>’s greeting as <PER>Ron</PER>’s entered the room to wake <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that <PER>Harry</PER> associated with exam review.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Disapparated with <PER>Ron</PER> first, then came back for <PER>Harry</PER>.
After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place.
“Right then,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, checking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch.
“And I thought we were supposed to open the door before <PER>Hermione</PER> got here?” <PER>Hermione</PER> squealed.
<PER>Hermione</PER> pulled the door back toward <PER>Hermione</PER>, to make it look as though it was still closed.
“And now,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, turning back to face the other two in the alleyway, “we put on the Cloak again — ” “ — and we wait,” <PER>Ron</PER> finished, throwing it over <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Nicely done, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, emerging from behind a bin beside the theater door as <PER>Harry</PER> took off the Invisibility Cloak.
As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put them on, <PER>Harry</PER> checked <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch.
“We’re running late, Mister Magical Maintenance will be here any second.” They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but <PER>Hermione</PER> remained in view, waiting.
As <PER>Hermione</PER> and the wizard headed for the main road, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> crept along behind them.
Using a repulsed <PER>Hermione</PER> to claw his way back into a standing position, his turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the bag <PER>Ron</PER> had snatched from his hand as his went and some flying chunks of vomit.
“Urgh,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, holding up the skirts of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robe to avoid the puddles of sick.
Finally <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> reappeared.
“We don’t know who he is,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, passing <PER>Harry</PER> several curly black hairs, “but he’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed!
“Blimey, that’s scary,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>, who now towered over him.
“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, “and let’s go, it’s nearly nine.” They stepped out of the alleyway together.
“See you in a moment, then,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> nervously, and <PER>Hermione</PER> tottered off down the steps to LADIES.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white.
“Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?” And he and <PER>Harry</PER> let he and <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> into adjoining cubicles.
“Looks like it,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered back; <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice came out deep and gravelly.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew at once that <PER>Harry</PER> had done the right thing; though <PER>Harry</PER> appeared to be standing in water, <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up clumsily; there was a lot more of <PER>Harry</PER>'s body than <PER>Harry</PER> was accustomed to.
<PER>Harry</PER> received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You got in all right, then?” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered theirs, but nobody followed theirs: It was as if theirs were infectious.
“If I don’t turn up, my wife — I mean, Cattermole ’s wife — ” “Well come with you, we should stick together — ” began <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head feverishly.
He glanced over at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as the lift creaked upward once more; <PER>Hermione</PER> was now whispering frantic instructions to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> give <PER>Ron</PER> a little push and <PER>Harry</PER> hurried out of the lift, followed by the other wizards, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone.
The moment the golden door had closed <PER>Hermione</PER> said, very fast, “Actually, <PER>Harry</PER>, I think I’d better go after him, I don’t think him knows what him’s doing and if him gets caught the whole thing — ” “Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.” The golden grilles slid apart again and <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped.
“Ah, Mafalda!” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Glancing over his shoulder, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER>’s anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of her, <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder.
“Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat dry.
The moment the Minister had passed out of sight, <PER>Harry</PER> tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under <PER>Harry</PER>'s heavy black cloak, threw it over <PER>Harry</PER>, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction.
Runcorn was so tall that <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to stoop to make sure <PER>Harry</PER>'s big feet were hidden.
As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner’s name and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force its upon he so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish.
the plan he had been carefully concocting with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish had concentrated all the plan he had been carefully concocting with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish's efforts on getting inside without being detected: They had not given a moment’s thought to what They would do if They were forced to separate.
Now <PER>Hermione</PER> was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; <PER>Ron</PER> was struggling to do magic that <PER>Harry</PER> was sure was beyond <PER>Harry</PER>, a woman’s liberty possibly depending on the outcome; and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift.
After a few seconds, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the same pattern; and after a few more seconds <PER>Harry</PER> realized that what <PER>Harry</PER> was watching was the creation of pamphlets — that the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard.
<PER>Harry</PER> crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what the workers were doing that <PER>Harry</PER> doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and <PER>Harry</PER> slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch.
“What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?” The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; <PER>Harry</PER> looked too, and rage reared in <PER>Harry</PER> like a snake.
For a split second <PER>Harry</PER> forgot where <PER>Harry</PER> was and what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing there: <PER>Harry</PER> even forgot that <PER>Harry</PER> was invisible.
The plaque beneath it read: Below that, a slightly shinier new plaque read: <PER>Harry</PER> looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though the dozen pamphlet-makers were intent upon the dozen pamphlet-makers's work, <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly suppose that the dozen pamphlet-makers would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them.
A few moments later, during which <PER>Harry</PER> waited with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned the doorknob, stepped into <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office, and closed the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> had stepped back in time.
<PER>Harry</PER> wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of the telescope, and placed the telescope in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> turned to face the room again, raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and murmured, “Accio Locket.” Nothing happened, but <PER>Harry</PER> had not expected it to; no doubt <PER>Umbridge</PER> knew all about protective charms and spells.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved across to read it and saw that <PER>Umbridge</PER> had written, “To be punished.” Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was staring at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk.
<PER>Harry</PER> crossed the room at a run and snatched the room up, but realized the moment <PER>Harry</PER> touched it that it was not a mirror at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across <PER>Harry</PER>'s hat — The Life and Lies ofAlbus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — nor the slightly smaller writing across <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest: “by <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?” <PER>Harry</PER> opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with both's arms around each other’s shoulders.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum’s chin that had so annoyed <PER>Ron</PER>.
The boy who roared in silent amusement beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had a gleeful, wild look about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The boy who roared in silent amusement beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> golden hair fell in curls to The boy who roared in silent amusement beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s shoulders.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether it was a young Doge, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could check the caption, the door of the office opened.
If Thicknesse had not been looking over Thicknesse's shoulder as Thicknesse entered, <PER>Harry</PER> would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over <PER>Harry</PER>.
As it was, <PER>Harry</PER> thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two <PER>Harry</PER> remained quite still, staring curiously at the place where <PER>Harry</PER> had just vanished.
Perhaps deciding that all <PER>Harry</PER> had seen was <PER>Dumbledore</PER> scratching <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s nose on the front of the book, for <PER>Harry</PER> had hastily replaced it upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed Thicknesse's wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they’re so careless, remember that poisonous duck?” Speeding back toward the lifts, <PER>Harry</PER> reviewed his options.
The first thing to do was to find <PER>Ron</PER>, and then they could work out a way of extracting <PER>Hermione</PER> from the courtroom.
To <PER>Harry</PER>'s enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-eyed <PER>Ron</PER> got in.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, it’s me, <PER>Harry</PER>!” “<PER>Harry</PER>!
He addressed Arthur’s shoulder, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure <PER>Harry</PER> was scared that <PER>Harry</PER>'s father might recognize <PER>Harry</PER> if they looked directly into each other’s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> made to follow him, but found <PER>Harry</PER>'s path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose buried in some papers he was reading.
For the second time, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to get out, but this time found <PER>Harry</PER>'s way blocked by Arthur’s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> decided <PER>Harry</PER>'s best chance was to act stupid.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> was impersonating somebody other than Runcorn.
<PER>Harry</PER> would try to extricate <PER>Hermione</PER> on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own while <PER>Ron</PER> was dealing with the raining office.
<PER>Harry</PER> set off, <PER>Harry</PER>'s destination not the black door, but the doorway <PER>Harry</PER> remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers.
<PER>Harry</PER> mind grappled with possibilities as <PER>Harry</PER> crept down them: <PER>Harry</PER> still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with Mafalda?
Of course, <PER>Harry</PER> did not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this, and even if <PER>Harry</PER> managed it, <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they were clear of the Ministry .
Lost in thought, <PER>Harry</PER> did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over <PER>Harry</PER>, as if <PER>Harry</PER> were descending into fog.
It was becoming colder and colder with every step <PER>Harry</PER> took: a cold that reached right down into <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat and tore at <PER>Harry</PER>'s lungs.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, filling <PER>Harry</PER>, expanding inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
So he moved forward as silently as he could, and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced he to think of <PER>Hermione</PER> and of <PER>Ron</PER>, who needed he.
<PER>Harry</PER> did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because <PER>Harry</PER> hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, <PER>Harry</PER> slipped into the courtroom behind her.
Here, behind a balustrade, sat <PER>Umbridge</PER>, with Yaxley on one side of her, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, quite as white-faced as Mistress Cattermole, on the other.
“I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!” <PER>Umbridge</PER> ignored <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind <PER>Umbridge</PER>, Yaxley, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, taking a seat behind the latter.
He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon <PER>Umbridge</PER> and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause <PER>Hermione</PER> alarm.
Then <PER>Umbridge</PER> raised her voice to address Mistress Cattermole, and <PER>Harry</PER> seized his chance.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> laughed a soft girlish laugh that made <PER>Harry</PER> want to attack her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had seen it; <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a little squeak, but <PER>Umbridge</PER> and Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else.
<PER>Hermione</PER> fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside <PER>Hermione</PER>, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mistress Cattermole’s name on it.
It was <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s lie that brought the blood surging into <PER>Harry</PER>’s brain and obliterated <PER>Harry</PER>'s sense of caution — that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster shis own pure-blood credentials.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, Mistress Cattermole!” <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the dementors had moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint.
“Get the Horcrux,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, how do I get rid of these chains?” “Wait, I’m trying something up here — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, we’re surrounded by dementors!” “I know that, <PER>Harry</PER>, but if she wakes up and the locket’s gone — I need to duplicate it — Geminio\ There That should fool her.
“As many as we can muster; do yours, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “Expec — Expecto patronum,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“C’mon,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> led <PER>Hermione</PER> and Mistress Cattermole to the door.
“Runcorn let me out, he attacked <PER>Umbridge</PER> and Yaxley, and he’s told all of us to leave the country, I think us’d better do it, Reg, I really do, let’s hurry home and fetch the children and — why are you so wet?” “Water,” muttered <PER>Ron</PER>, disengaging himself.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, they know there are intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office door, I reckon we’ve got five minutes if that — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s Patronus vanished with a pop as <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s Patronus turned a horror-struck face to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, if we’re trapped here — !” “We won’t be if we move fast,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> addressed the silent group behind them, who were all gawping at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” squeaked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Follow me,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to the group of terrified Muggle-borns, who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I didn’t mean nothing, Albert, but I thought I thought they were in for questioning and ” “they blood is pure,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s deep voice echoed impressively through the hall.
As the balding wizard lifted his wand, <PER>Harry</PER> raised an enormous fist and punched <PER>Harry</PER>, sending <PER>Harry</PER> flying through the air.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“Come on!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted at <PER>Hermione</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> flung open the door; <PER>Ron</PER> was standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mistress Cattermole.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Hermione</PER> by the hand and <PER>Ron</PER> by the arm and turned on the spot.
his wondered whether his was going to suffocate; his could not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s fingers, which were slowly slipping away .
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea what had happened, <PER>Harry</PER> only knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs.
Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened, <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above <PER>Harry</PER>.
Looking around, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they and <PER>Hermione</PER> were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though <PER>Harry</PER> knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut.
However, in the few moments it took for <PER>Ron</PER> to give a low groan and <PER>Harry</PER> to start crawling toward him, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that this was not the Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, The trees were more widely spaced, the ground clearer.
<PER>Harry</PER> met <PER>Hermione</PER>, also on her hands and knees, at <PER>Ron</PER>’s head.
The moment his eyes fell upon <PER>Ron</PER>, all other concerns fled <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, for blood drenched the whole of <PER>Ron</PER>’s left side and <PER>Ron</PER>’s's face stood out, grayish- white, against the leaf-strewn earth.
“What’s happened to him?” “Splinched,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her fingers already busy at <PER>Ron</PER>’s sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched, horrified, as she tore open <PER>Ron</PER>’s shirt.
<PER>Harry</PER> had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this <PER>Harry</PER> insides crawled unpleasantly as <PER>Hermione</PER> laid bare <PER>Ron</PER>’s upper arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany’ — ” “Bag — right — ” <PER>Harry</PER> sped to the place where <PER>Hermione</PER> had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand inside it.
“Accio Dittany\” A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught A small brown bottle and hastened back to <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids.
“Unstopper it for me, <PER>Harry</PER>, my hands are shaking.” <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, <PER>Hermione</PER> took the stopper and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think <PER>Harry</PER> can.
With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, <PER>Harry</PER> imagined the house-elf busying <PER>Harry</PER> over the steak-and-kidney pie that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> would never eat.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> had stuck it to <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s office door, to spy on people.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> was still gray and “<PER>Umbridge</PER>'s face glistened with sweat.
“I wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was — ” “ — the first place you thought of,” <PER>Harry</PER> finished for <PER>Hermione</PER>, glancing around at the apparently deserted glade.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place <PER>Hermione</PER> had thought of — how Death Eaters had found them within minutes.
Did <PER>Voldemort</PER> or his henchmen know, even now, where <PER>Hermione</PER> had taken henchmen?
“D’you reckon we should move on?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell by the look on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face that he was thinking the same.
Looking relieved, <PER>Hermione</PER> sprang to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet.
“If we’re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,” she replied, and raising shis wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, murmuring incantations as she went.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if <PER>Hermione</PER> had cast a heat haze upon their clearing.
“Apparently <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want it back, <PER>Harry</PER>'s lumbago’s so bad,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand, “so <PER>Ron</PER>’s dad said I could borrow it.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other.
“I’m sorry,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, moaning a little as <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER> to look at them, “but it feels like a — a jinx or something.
“In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling You-Know- Who by his name didn’t do <PER>Dumbledore</PER> much good in the end,” <PER>Ron</PER> snapped back.
“Just — just show You- Know-Who some respect, will you?” “Respect?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, but <PER>Hermione</PER> shot <PER>Harry</PER> a warning look; apparently <PER>Harry</PER> was not to argue with <PER>Ron</PER> while the latter was in such a weakened condition.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> half carried, half dragged <PER>Ron</PER> through the entrance of the tent.
<PER>Harry</PER> shoved aside an old armchair and lowered <PER>Ron</PER> carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed.
Even this very short journey had turned <PER>Ron</PER> whiter still, and once they had settled <PER>Harry</PER> on the mattress <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes again and did not speak for a while.
“I’ll make some tea,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag and heading toward the kitchen.
<PER>Harry</PER> found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
“What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?” “With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, clutching <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hot mug for comfort.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was watching <PER>Ron</PER> fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s expression that <PER>Harry</PER> felt almost as if <PER>Harry</PER> had surprised her in the act of kissing <PER>Harry</PER>.
“So, have you got it?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked her, partly to remind her that <PER>Harry</PER> was there.
“There ’d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.” <PER>Hermione</PER> passed it had been magically destroyed.” to <PER>Harry</PER>, who turned it over in his fingers.
He handed the locket back to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, each of whom did each of whom's best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been.
“What d’you mean?” <PER>Ron</PER> passed the Horcrux to <PER>Harry</PER>.
After a moment or two, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Ron</PER> meant.
“Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it,” <PER>Harry</PER> replied, and, little though <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to, <PER>Harry</PER> hung the chain around <PER>Harry</PER>'s own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where the locket rested against the locket] chest beside the pouch <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given him.
With the Sneakoscope <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> for <PER>Harry</PER>'s birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout.
Evening brought no change; <PER>Harry</PER> lit <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand as he swapped places with <PER>Hermione</PER> at ten o’clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had not packed any food in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s magical bag, as <PER>Hermione</PER> had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that <PER>Hermione</PER> had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan.
After a couple of mouthfuls <PER>Ron</PER> had pushed his portion away, looking queasy; <PER>Harry</PER> had only persevered so as not to hurt <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s feelings.
The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs: <PER>Harry</PER> thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, yet <PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held tight at the ready.
<PER>Harry</PER> had thought that <PER>Harry</PER> would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but somehow <PER>Harry</PER> did not; all <PER>Harry</PER> felt as <PER>Harry</PER> sat looking out at the darkness, of which <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next.
From time to time <PER>Harry</PER> thought, or perhaps imagined, that <PER>Harry</PER> could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
Nameless forebodings crept upon <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> sat there in the dark: <PER>Harry</PER> tried to resist them, push them away, yet them came at <PER>Harry</PER> relentlessly.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, now talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: him could not.
And it seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> sat there trying to master <PER>Harry</PER>'s own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time <PER>Harry</PER> had left.
Stupid idea, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, don’t think that.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward <PER>Harry</PER> in the past month, that <PER>Harry</PER> would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen?
Sick images swarmed into <PER>Harry</PER>’s head and he tried to push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher: he and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already decided against trying to summon he; what if someone from the Ministry came too?
Sick images swarmed into <PER>Harry</PER>’s head and <PER>Harry</PER>’s tried to push these away too, for there was nothing <PER>Harry</PER>’s could do for Kreacher: <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already decided against trying to summon <PER>Harry</PER>’s; what if someone from the Ministry came too could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s sleeve.
<PER>Snape</PER>, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had fallen fallen “ Give it to me, Gregorovitch.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s voice was high, clear, and cold, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held in front of <PER>Harry</PER> by a long-fingered white hand.
In the split second that the lantern’s light illuminated him, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the delight upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a crow of laughter.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind, then!” “I didn’t mean it to happen!” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“He’s found Gregorovitch, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I think He’s killed He, but before He killed He He read Gregorovitch ’s mind and I saw — ” “I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re falling asleep,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> coldly.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; <PER>Harry</PER> climbed into the one above <PER>Harry</PER>, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling.
After several moments, <PER>Ron</PER> spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to <PER>Hermione</PER>, huddled in the entrance.
“What’s <PER>Voldemort</PER> doing?” <PER>Harry</PER> screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered into the darkness.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had said nothing about <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, nothing about the twin cores, nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
“<PER>Harry</PER> wanted something from Gregorovitch,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, eyes still closed tight.
“<PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from <PER>Harry</PER> and then then ” Gregorovitch remembered how Gregorovitch, as <PER>Voldemort</PER>, had seemed to hurtle through Gregorovitch ’s eyes, into <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s memories.
The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all <PER>Harry</PER> could hear was <PER>Ron</PER>’s breathing.
After a while, <PER>Ron</PER> whispered, “Couldn’t you see what the thief was holding?” “No it must’ve been something small.” “<PER>Harry</PER>?” The wooden slats of <PER>Ron</PER>’s bunk creaked as he repositioned he in bed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you don’t reckon <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s after something else to turn into a Horcrux?” “I don’t know,” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly.
He had been sure that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin cores, sure that <PER>Voldemort</PER> sought a solution from the old wandmaker and yet He had killed <PER>Voldemort</PER>, apparently without asking <PER>Voldemort</PER> a single question about wandlore.
him had soared from the windowsill like a bird, and <PER>Harry</PER> had seen him before, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not think where.
With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and it was on him that <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts dwelled, as <PER>Ron</PER>’s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more.
Early next morning, before the other two were awake, <PER>Harry</PER> left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree <PER>Harry</PER> could find.
It was not much, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s door.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and <PER>Ron</PER> agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took they within reach of a bacon sandwich.
<PER>Hermione</PER> therefore removed the enchantments <PER>Hermione</PER> had placed around the clearing, while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there.
“But you can make a brilliant Patronus!” protested <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> arrived back at the tent empty- handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors.
“I couldn’t make one,” <PER>Harry</PER> panted, clutching the stitch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
It had taken all <PER>Harry</PER>’s willpower to uproot <PER>Harry</PER> from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair them cast wherever them went.
“So we still haven’t got any food.” “Shut up, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was afraid that something had gone wrong inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed!” “That’s convenient.” “And what’s that supposed to — ?” “Of course!” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, clapping a hand to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s forehead and startling both of them into silence.
The moment it parted contact with <PER>Harry</PER>’s skin <PER>Harry</PER> felt free and oddly light.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not even realized that <PER>Harry</PER> was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach until both sensations lifted.
“If we lose it, if it gets stolen — ” “Oh, all right, all right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> placed it around <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own neck and tucked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own neck out of sight down the front of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shirt.
“But we’ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.” “Great,” said <PER>Ron</PER> irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that out, can we please get some food?” “Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with half a glance at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was least surprised by this, because <PER>Harry</PER> had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys’.
<PER>Hermione</PER> bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s silences rather dour.
his did not seem to have any ideas his, but expected <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to come up with plans while his sat and brooded over the low food supplies.
Accordingly <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> spent fruitless hours trying to decide where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already got, <PER>Harry</PER>'s conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had no new information.
As <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> that he believed <PER>Voldemort</PER> had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had lived or visited.
Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, <PER>Harry</PER> plowed on, “I still reckon <PER>Harry</PER> might have hidden something at Hogwarts.” <PER>Hermione</PER> sighed.
“But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have found it, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated the argument <PER>Harry</PER> kept bringing out in favor of this theory.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said in front of me that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> never assumed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew all of Hogwarts’s secrets.
“If there was one place that was really important to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, it was Hogwarts!” “Oh, come on,” scoffed <PER>Ron</PER>.
His was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around His's neck: <PER>Harry</PER> was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You told us that <PER>Voldemort</PER> asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to give him a job after he left,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably another founder’s object, to make into another Horcrux?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t get the job, did <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“So <PER>Harry</PER> never got the chance to find a founder’s object there and hide a founder’s object there in the school!” “Okay, then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, defeated.
He had known it all along: The orphanage had been the place <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been determined to escape; <PER>Voldemort</PER> would never have hidden a part of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s soul there.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had shown <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Voldemort</PER> sought grandeur or mystique in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, with its golden doors and marble floors.
It happened most often, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, when <PER>Harry</PER> was wearing the Horcrux.
Sometimes <PER>Harry</PER> could not stop <PER>Harry</PER> reacting to the pain.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Ron</PER> was hoping to hear news of <PER>Harry</PER>'s family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was not a television aerial; <PER>Harry</PER> could only see what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took <PER>Harry</PER>'s fancy.
Apparently <PER>Voldemort</PER> was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure, <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew no better than <PER>Voldemort</PER> did.
As <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s memory, <PER>Harry</PER> learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief.
As the days stretched into weeks, <PER>Harry</PER> began to suspect that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were having conversations without, and about, him.
Several times they stopped talking abruptly when <PER>Harry</PER> entered the tent, and twice <PER>Harry</PER> came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; Several times they fell silent when they realized <PER>Harry</PER> was approaching they and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought <PER>Harry</PER> had some secret plan that they would learn in due course.
<PER>Ron</PER> was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to fear that <PER>Hermione</PER> too was disappointed by <PER>Harry</PER>'s poor leadership.
The fact that <PER>Hermione</PER> was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for identifying edible fungi's continuing isolation, the lack of other people’s company, or identifying edible fungi's total ignorance of what was going on in the war against <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced automatically at <PER>Ron</PER>’s neck and saw, as <PER>Harry</PER> had expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there.
<PER>Harry</PER> managed to fight down the impulse to swear at <PER>Ron</PER>, whose attitude would, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket.
<PER>Hermione</PER> jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off <PER>Hermione</PER>'s tin plate onto the floor.
“ You can do the cooking tomorrow, <PER>Ron</PER>, you can find the ingredients and try and charm the ingredients into something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you — ” “Shut up!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, leaping to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and holding up both hands.
<PER>Hermione</PER> snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment <PER>Hermione</PER> drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh- colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance.
<PER>Harry</PER> pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into <PER>Harry</PER>'s own: Over the murmur of the river <PER>Harry</PER> could make out more voices, but more voices were not speaking English or any human language <PER>Harry</PER> had ever heard.
“Here, Griphook, Gornuk.” Goblins\ <PER>Hermione</PER> mouthed at <PER>Harry</PER>, who nodded.
Inside the tent <PER>Harry</PER>’s breathing was shallow with excitement: <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at each other, listening as hard as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> could.
“About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of <PER>Snape</PER> ’s office at Hogwarts?” An electric current seemed to course through <PER>Harry</PER>, jangling <PER>Harry</PER>'s every nerve as <PER>Harry</PER> stood rooted to the spot.
Inside the tent, <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, willing someone to ask the question <PER>Harry</PER> needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged; <PER>Harry</PER> was (<PER>Harry</PER> remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s too.
“You believe <PER>Snape</PER> killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “ ’Course I do,” said Ted.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> reeled in the Extendable Ears.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more than, “<PER>Ginny</PER> — the sword — ” “I know!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arm in it right up to the armpit.
As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bag, <PER>Hermione</PER> kept <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment.
“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office,” she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, “Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, “Phineas Nigellus hangs right beside the case!” “Unless he was asleep,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but he still held <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath as <PER>Hermione</PER> knelt down in front of the empty canvas, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said: “Er — Phineas?
“That sword isn’t <PER>Snape</PER>’s.” “It belongs to Professor <PER>Snape</PER>’s school,” said Phineas Nigellus.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s not an oaf!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrilly.
“And Professor <PER>Snape</PER> might’ve thought that was a punishment,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna probably had a good laugh with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s portrait — couldn’t you bring <PER>Dumbledore</PER> along, here, into yours?” Phineas Nigellus turned <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face in the direction of <PER>Harry</PER>’s voice.
“I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave the sword of Gryffindor case was when Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> used it to break open a ring.” <PER>Hermione</PER> whipped around to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> has more important things on Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s mind than the many eccentricities of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s portrait back into the beaded bag; when <PER>Hermione</PER> had fastened the clasp <PER>Hermione</PER> threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Why hadn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told n’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
Or had <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, in fact, told <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had not realized it at the time?
“Nobody ever goes in there.” “But <PER>Snape</PER> knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusted <PER>Snape</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> reminded her.
“Not enough to tell <PER>Harry</PER> that him had swapped the swords,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Yeah, you’re right!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt even more cheered at the thought that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had had some reservations, however faint, about <PER>Snape</PER> ’s trustworthiness.
For one bewildered moment he thought that <PER>Ron</PER> had left the tent, then realized that <PER>Ron</PER> was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk, looking stony.
Dread doused <PER>Harry</PER>’s jubilation: <PER>Ron</PER> was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared he to be thinking.
“We thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told you what to do, We thought you had a real plan!” “<PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ignored <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“So why are you still here?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>, and he took several steps toward <PER>Harry</PER>, who did not back away.
“Go back to them, pretend you’ve got over your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and — ” <PER>Ron</PER> made a sudden movement: <PER>Harry</PER> reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner’s pocket, <PER>Hermione</PER> had raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own.
“Protego\” Protego\ cried, and an invisible shield expanded between Protego\'s and <PER>Harry</PER> on the one side and <PER>Ron</PER> on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a corrosive hatred toward <PER>Ron</PER>: Something had broken between them.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling <PER>Ron</PER>’s name amongst the trees.
<PER>Harry</PER> stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around <PER>Harry</PER>'s own neck.
He dragged blankets off <PER>Ron</PER>’s bunk and threw them over <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Then <PER>Ron</PER>’s climbed onto <PER>Ron</PER>’s's own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.
When <PER>Harry</PER> woke the following day it was several seconds before <PER>Harry</PER> remembered what had happened.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> hoped, childishly, that it had been a dream, that <PER>Ron</PER> was still there and had never left.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped down from <PER>Harry</PER>'s own bed, keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes averted from <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish <PER>Harry</PER> good morning, but turned her face away quickly as he went by.
he’s gone, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to keep thinking it as <PER>Harry</PER> washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull the shock of it.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s gone and <PER>Harry</PER>’s not coming back.
And that was the simple truth of it, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible, once they vacated this spot, for <PER>Ron</PER> to find them again.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank; several times <PER>Harry</PER> saw shis look up eagerly, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure she had deluded she into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees.
Every time <PER>Harry</PER> imitated she, looked around (for <PER>Harry</PER> could not help hoping a little, <PER>Harry</PER>) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another little parcel of fury exploded inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Ron</PER> saying, “ We thought you knew what you were doing \” , and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach.
Finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay: <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> grasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside.
The instant they arrived, <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and walked away from <PER>Harry</PER>, finally sitting down on a large rock, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knees, shaking with what <PER>Harry</PER> knew were sobs.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched her, supposing that <PER>Harry</PER> ought to go and comfort her, but something kept <PER>Harry</PER> rooted to the spot.
Everything inside <PER>Harry</PER> felt cold and tight: Again <PER>Harry</PER> saw the contemptuous expression on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught <PER>Hermione</PER> at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection.
<PER>Harry</PER> was determined never to mention <PER>Harry</PER>'s name again, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear shis crying.
<PER>Harry</PER> was waiting for the moment when <PER>Ron</PER>’s labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that <PER>Harry</PER> had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by <PER>Harry</PER>'s status of pureblood.
However, <PER>Ron</PER> did not appear on the map, and after a while <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> taking it out simply to stare at <PER>Ginny</PER>’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which <PER>Harry</PER> gazed at it might break into her sleep, that her would somehow know <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking about her, hoping that her was all right.
Cudgel his brains though his might, <PER>Harry</PER> could not remember <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ever mentioning a place in which <PER>Harry</PER> might hide something.
There were moments when <PER>Harry</PER> did not know whether <PER>Harry</PER> was angrier with <PER>Ron</PER> or with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with virtually nothing.
him knew nothing, him had no ideas, and him was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indication that <PER>Hermione</PER> too was about to tell him that <PER>Hermione</PER> had had enough, that <PER>Hermione</PER> was leaving.
They were spending many evenings in near silence, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus’s portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by <PER>Ron</PER>’s departure.
<PER>Harry</PER> was even glad to see <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Harry</PER> was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind.
Phineas Nigellus venerated <PER>Snape</PER>, the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about <PER>Snape</PER>, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting.
<PER>Snape</PER> had reinstated <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies.
From all of these things, <PER>Harry</PER> deduced that <PER>Ginny</PER>, and probably <PER>Neville</PER> and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army.
This scant news made <PER>Harry</PER> want to see <PER>Ginny</PER> so badly it felt like a stomachache; but This scant news also made <PER>Harry</PER> think of <PER>Ron</PER> again, and of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and of Hogwarts itself, which <PER>Harry</PER> missed nearly as much as <PER>Harry</PER>'s ex-girlfriend.
Indeed, as Phineas Nigellus talked about <PER>Snape</PER> ’s crackdown, <PER>Harry</PER> experienced a split second of madness when <PER>Harry</PER> imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of <PER>Snape</PER>’s regime: Being fed, and having a soft bed, and other people being in charge, seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment.
But then <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic.
Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s whereabouts.
They had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when <PER>Harry</PER> resolved to suggest, again, what seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> the only unexplored avenue left to They.
They had just eaten an unusually good meal: <PER>Hermione</PER> had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as <PER>Hermione</PER> left), and <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Hermione</PER> might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.
<PER>Harry</PER> had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours’ break from wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> cleared <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt exactly as <PER>Harry</PER> had done on the occasion, several years previously, when <PER>Harry</PER> had asked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> whether Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I’ve been thinking, and — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, could you help me with something?” Apparently <PER>Hermione</PER> had not been listening to “<PER>Harry</PER>.
Above what <PER>Harry</PER> assumed was the title of the story (being unable to read runes, <PER>Harry</PER> could not be sure) , there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.
It was a sticky moment: <PER>Harry</PER> knew that she had sensed <PER>Ron</PER>’s name in the offing.
<PER>Harry</PER> rushed on: “She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.” “Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured <PER>Hermione</PER>, running Shis index finger over Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic.
“Well, I suppose She gasped so dramatically that <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides turned over; <PER>Harry</PER> drew <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there.
If so, <PER>Harry</PER> felt that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left a great deal to chance: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda.
Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with <PER>Harry</PER>’s dearest wish.
It was in Godric’s Hollow that, but for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER> would have grown up and spent every school holiday.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> could have invited friends to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s house.
After <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone to bed that night, <PER>Harry</PER> quietly extracted <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack from <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> so long ago.
For the first time in months, <PER>Harry</PER> perused the old pictures of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents, smiling and waving up at <PER>Harry</PER> from the images, which were all <PER>Harry</PER> had left of them now.
<PER>Harry</PER> would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow the following day, but <PER>Hermione</PER> had other ideas.
Convinced as <PER>Hermione</PER> was that <PER>Voldemort</PER> would expect <PER>Harry</PER> to return to the scene of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible.
They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, <PER>Harry</PER> transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man, <PER>Hermione</PER> into his small and rather mousy wife.
The beaded bag containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which <PER>Harry</PER> was wearing around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck) was tucked into an inside pocket of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s buttoned-up coat.
Heart beating in his throat, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front porches, wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> remembered any of them, knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that <PER>Harry</PER> had been little more than a year old when <PER>Harry</PER> had left this place forever.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not even sure whether <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to see the cottage at all; <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Perhaps <PER>Hermione</PER> knew how he was feeling, because <PER>Hermione</PER> reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling he forward.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, look!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was pointing at the war memorial.
<PER>Harry</PER> drew closer, gazing up into <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ faces.
How strange it was to see <PER>Harry</PER> represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
It made <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat constrict, it reminded <PER>Harry</PER> so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor, of the Great Hall’s twelve Christmas trees, of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of <PER>Ron</PER> in a hand-knitted sweater .
“<PER>Harry</PER>, here!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, his heart positively banging in his chest.
So <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter and Muriel had got some of <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter and Muriel's facts right.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help thinking that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ought to have told <PER>Harry</PER> so, yet <PER>Harry</PER> had never thought to share the connection.
They could have visited the place together; for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> imagined coming here with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to <PER>Harry</PER>.
But it seemed that to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted <PER>Harry</PER> to do.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was glad that <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was hidden in shadow.
Surely <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had chosen them, as the eldest member of the family once <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mother had died.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> curtly, then, “let’s keep looking,” and <PER>Harry</PER> turned away, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen the stone: <PER>Harry</PER> did not want <PER>Harry</PER>'s excited trepidation tainted with resentment.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come back a moment.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way back through the snow toward her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> showed <PER>Harry</PER> the symbol beneath it.
Deeper and deeper amongst the graves <PER>Harry</PER> went, and every time <PER>Harry</PER> reached a new headstone <PER>Harry</PER> felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, they’re here right here.” And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on He's chest, the same sensation He had had right after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had died, a grief that had actually weighed on He's heart and lungs.
<PER>Harry</PER> read the words slowly, as though <PER>Harry</PER> would have only one chance to take in their meaning, and <PER>Harry</PER> read the last of their aloud.
But <PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, moved wand in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught it and laid it on <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ grave.
As soon as <PER>Harry</PER> stood up <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to leave: <PER>Harry</PER> did not think <PER>Harry</PER> could stand another moment there.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm around <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulders, and <PER>Hermione</PER> put hers around <PER>Harry</PER>'s waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring <PER>Hermione</PER>, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement.
For a moment <PER>Harry</PER> considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could say anything <PER>Hermione</PER> murmured, “Let’s go this way,” and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered.
Next moment He had sped up, dragging <PER>Hermione</PER> along with He; <PER>Hermione</PER> slipped a little on the ice.
The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since <PER>Hagrid</PER> had taken <PER>Harry</PER> from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it.
<PER>Harry</PER> was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew instinctively that she would not.
<PER>Hermione</PER> moved closer to him under the Cloak, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arm pressed against him.
<PER>Harry</PER> could think of many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet <PER>Harry</PER>'s suspicions about The woman's identity were growing stronger every moment that identity stood facing each other in the deserted street.
That <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told shis to wait, and that <PER>Harry</PER> would come in the end?
Finally <PER>Harry</PER> spoke, causing <PER>Hermione</PER> to gasp and jump.
Beneath the Cloak <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyebrows; <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a tiny, nervous nod.
She smelled bad, or perhaps it was Shis house: <PER>Harry</PER> wrinkled <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> became aware of the locket against <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; <PER>Harry</PER> could feel it pulsing through the cold gold.
Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing <PER>Hermione</PER> aside as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had not seen <PER>Hermione</PER>, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m not sure about this,” breathed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Look at the size of <PER>Hermione</PER>; I think we could overpower <PER>Hermione</PER>'s if we had to,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> jumped and clutched <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
“It’s okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> reassuringly, and <PER>Harry</PER> led the way into the sitting room.
“Let me do that,” offered <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> took the matches from her.
her stood watching <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups.
And it came to <PER>Harry</PER> instantly where <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, arm in arm with the teenage <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and that must be where all the missing photographs were: in <PER>Rita</PER>’s book.
“Miss Bagshot?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, and Bagshot?” <PER>Harry</PER> advanced with the picture in Bagshot?” <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what are you doing?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Why did you ask us to come with you, Mistress — Miss — Bagshot?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, raising <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own voice.
“Was there something you wanted to tell us?” Giving no sign that she had heard <PER>Hermione</PER>, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Oh, right <PER>Hermione</PER>, I think <PER>Hermione</PER> wants me to go upstairs with <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “All right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “let’s go.” But when <PER>Hermione</PER> moved, Bathilda shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head with surprising vigor, once more pointing first at <PER>Harry</PER>, then to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> wants me to go with <PER>Hermione</PER>, alone.” “Why?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise.
“Maybe <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to give the sword to me, and only to me?” “Do you really think she knows who you are?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, “I think she does.” “Well, okay then, but be quick, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Lead the way,” <PER>Harry</PER> told Bathilda.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced back at <PER>Hermione</PER> with a reassuring smile, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure <PER>Hermione</PER> had seen it; <PER>Hermione</PER> stood hugging <PER>Hermione</PER> in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase.
As <PER>Harry</PER> walked out of the room, unseen by both <PER>Hermione</PER> and Bathilda, <PER>Harry</PER> slipped the silver- P a g e ?
The stairs were steep and narrow: <PER>Harry</PER> was half tempted to place <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands on stout Bathilda’s backside to ensure that stout Bathilda’s did not topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too likely.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than <PER>Harry</PER>'s own heart: It was an unpleasant, agitating sensation.
“Have you got anything for me?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, but she seemed distracted by <PER>Harry</PER>'s lit wand-tip.
Then she closed shis eyes and several things happened at once: <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved momentarily.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: Hold <PER>Harry</PER>).
<PER>Harry</PER> swayed where <PER>Harry</PER> stood: The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around <PER>Harry</PER> again; <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what had just happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window.
<PER>Harry</PER> edged between shis and the unmade bed, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand raised.
“What is it?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked as <PER>Harry</PER> reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.
From below his heard <PER>Hermione</PER> call, “<PER>Harry</PER>?” his could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a heavy smooth mass smashed his to the floor and his felt it slide over his, powerful, muscular “No!” No!
He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: the snake struck, and <PER>Hermione</PER> dived aside with a shriek; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered.
Frozen air filled the room as <PER>Harry</PER> ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot slipped on a pencil-like something — his wand — <PER>Harry</PER> bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, the room tail thrashing; <PER>Hermione</PER> was nowhere to be seen and for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, but as <PER>Harry</PER> did so, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years.
Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as <PER>Harry</PER> jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape <PER>Harry</PER> knew to be <PER>Hermione</PER> — She shrieked with pain as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled Shis back across the bed: The snake reared again, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was going to split open with the pain from <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar — The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging <PER>Hermione</PER> with The snake; as it struck, <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed, “ ConfringoV’ and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; <PER>Harry</PER> felt the heat of it sear the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
Beneath the robe <PER>Harry</PER> fingered the handle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“Not <PER>Harry</PER>, not <PER>Harry</PER>, please not <PER>Harry</PER>!” “Stand aside, you silly girl stand aside, now.
<PER>Harry</PER>, not <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the thing that was rustling was not a snake.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“I couldn’t get the Horcrux off you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, and he knew <PER>Hermione</PER> wanted to change the subject.
“Where’s my wand, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> took it into <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> held out the wand to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> pointed it at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“ Expelliarmusl” <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave Expelliarmusl” <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s wand's hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what <PER>Harry</PER> was seeing the wand that had survived so much “<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered so quietly <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly hear <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“We’ll — We’ll find a way to repair it.” “<PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, the tears trickling down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet <PER>Harry</PER> could not appreciate it: <PER>Harry</PER> senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
Without realizing it, <PER>Harry</PER> was digging <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers into <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms as if <PER>Harry</PER> were trying to resist physical pain.
<PER>Harry</PER> had spilled <PER>Harry</PER>'s own blood more times than <PER>Harry</PER> could count; <PER>Harry</PER> had lost all the bones in <PER>Harry</PER>'s right arm once; this journey had already given <PER>Harry</PER> scars to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest and forearm to join those on <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of <PER>Harry</PER>'s magical power had been torn from <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew exactly what <PER>Hermione</PER> would say if <PER>Harry</PER> expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s hand brushed the old Snitch through the mokeskin and for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away.
Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left behind — And <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fury at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> broke over <PER>Dumbledore</PER> now like lava, scorching <PER>Dumbledore</PER> inside, wiping out every other feeling.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, them had no sword, and now, <PER>Harry</PER> had no wand.
And <PER>Harry</PER> had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely be easy now for <PER>Voldemort</PER> to find out who <PER>Voldemort</PER> was.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked frightened that <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Hermione</PER> face streaked with tears, <PER>Hermione</PER> crouched down beside <PER>Harry</PER>, two cups of tea trembling in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands and something bulky under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arm.
“You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>; he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes to the caption.
<PER>Harry</PER> soon discovered it and read greedily, but became lost: it was necessary to go further back to make sense of it all, and eventually <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> at the start of a chapter entitled “The Greater Good.” Together, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> started to read: Now approaching <PER>Harry</PER>'s eighteenth birthday, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory — Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal- Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias “Dogbreath” Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had picked up at school.
Certainly <PER>Dumbledore</PER> returned to Godric’s Hollow at once, supposedly to “care” for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s younger brother and sister.
How despicable does Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> appear, busy plotting Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s rise to power when Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> should have been mourning Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mother and caring for Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s sister!
No doubt those determined to keep Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s crumbling pedestal will bleat that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not, after all, put Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s plans into action, that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> must have suffered a change of heart, that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> came to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s senses.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> come to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s senses?
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told Grindelwald <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted no more part in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s plans?
However, there can be no doubt that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s attack upon Gellert Grindelwald.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had reached the bottom of the page before <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> tugged the book out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hands, looking a little alarmed by <PER>Harry</PER>'s expression, and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something indecent.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the phoenix wand “<PER>Harry</PER>.” She seemed to have heard his thoughts.
“I’m not trying to defend what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wrote,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so angry is that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told you any of this <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Maybe I am!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, and <PER>Harry</PER> flung <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, hardly knowing whether his was trying to hold in his anger or protect his from the weight of his own disillusionment.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had called out to <PER>Harry</PER> in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices.
Finally <PER>Harry</PER> got up in the darkness and joined <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, an impression reinforced by <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s solicitousness.
As darkness drew in again <PER>Harry</PER> refused <PER>Hermione</PER>’s offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters <PER>Harry</PER> owned but even so, still shivery.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that it must be full of living creatures, but <PER>Harry</PER> wished they would all remain still and silent so that <PER>Harry</PER> could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other, sinister movements.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and at once thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard it again before mentally shaking <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt that <PER>Harry</PER> had been waiting for her to come, but that <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged to meet.
<PER>Harry</PER> impulse to shout for <PER>Hermione</PER>, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone.
Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and <PER>Harry</PER> spun about, but all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked black surface glittering as <PER>Harry</PER> raised the wand higher to examine it.
What was it, <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> (walking again), that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> the last time <PER>Harry</PER> had retrieved the sword?
A small voice inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head answered <PER>Harry</PER>: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped walking and let out a long sigh, <PER>Harry</PER>'s smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Harry</PER> had to do.
If <PER>Harry</PER> was honest with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> had thought it might come to this from the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had spotted the sword through the ice.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack <PER>Harry</PER>.
They had had They's chance as <PER>Harry</PER> walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as <PER>Harry</PER> examined the pool.
With fumbling fingers <PER>Harry</PER> started to remove <PER>Harry</PER>'s many layers of clothing.
<PER>Harry</PER> put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and shaking, until <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> that it must be done, gathered all <PER>Harry</PER>'s courage, and dived.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked out wildly, trying to push <PER>Harry</PER> back to the surface, but merely propelled <PER>Harry</PER> into the rocky side of the pool.
Thrashing, suffocating, <PER>Harry</PER> scrabbled at the strangling chain, <PER>Harry</PER>'s frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and <PER>Harry</PER> was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing <PER>Harry</PER> could do, and the arms that closed around <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest were surely Death’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had come again, as <PER>Hermione</PER> had come when the snake attacked.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no strength to lift <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and see <PER>Harry</PER>'s savior’s identity.
Shivering violently, <PER>Harry</PER> staggered to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“Why the hell,” panted <PER>Ron</PER>, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, “didn’t you take this thing off before you dived?” <PER>Harry</PER> could not answer.
As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head, <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Ron</PER>, half expecting him to have disappeared every time him lost sight of him, and yet him had to be real: him had just dived into the pool, him had saved <PER>Harry</PER>’s life.
“It was y-you?” <PER>Harry</PER> said at last, <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth chattering, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice weaker than usual due to <PER>Harry</PER>'s near-strangulation.
“I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come up, so I wasn’t going to make a detour to — hey!” <PER>Harry</PER> was already hurrying to the place <PER>Ron</PER> had indicated.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked back to where <PER>Ron</PER> stood waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux.
It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill <PER>Harry</PER> rather than let <PER>Harry</PER> possess it.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around, holding <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree.
“Come here,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER> led the way, brushed snow from the rock’s surface, and held out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand for the Horcrux.
When <PER>Ron</PER> offered the sword, however, <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had at least taught <PER>Harry</PER> something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.
The answer came so readily to <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips that <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Harry</PER> had always known it deep down: Perhaps it had taken <PER>Harry</PER>'s recent encounter with Nagini to make <PER>Harry</PER> realize it.
“Let’s get rid of the damn thing, it’s been months — ” “I can’t, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m serious — you do it — ” “But why?” “Because that thing’s bad for me!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, backing away from the locket on the rock.
“On three,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking back down at the locket and narrowing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach.
<PER>Ron</PER> raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes, and <PER>Harry</PER> gripped the locket tightly, bracing <PER>Harry</PER>, already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows.
“ Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend Second best, always, eternally overshadowed ” “<PER>Ron</PER>, stab it now!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed: <PER>Harry</PER> could feel the locket quivering in <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip and was scared of what was coming.
<PER>Ron</PER> raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, <PER>Riddle</PER>’s eyes gleamed scarlet.
Out of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed, like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, weirdly distorted.
<PER>Ron</PER> yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, swaying over <PER>Ron</PER> and the real <PER>Harry</PER>, who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” he shouted, but the <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Harry</PER> was now speaking with <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s voice and <PER>Ron</PER> was gazing, mesmerized, into its face.
“ Your mother confessed,” sneered <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Harry</PER>, while <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Hermione</PER> jeered, “that <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Hermione</PER> would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange ” “Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him,” crooned <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Hermione</PER>, and what woman stretched like a snake and entwined what woman around <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Harry</PER>, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s raised the sword high, <PER>Ron</PER>’s's arms shaking.
“Do it, <PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked toward him, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — ?” The sword flashed, plunged: <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> out of the way, there was a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream.
<PER>Harry</PER> whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend <PER>Harry</PER>: but there was nothing to fight.
The monstrous versions of himself and <PER>Hermione</PER> were gone: There was only <PER>Ron</PER>, standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock.
Slowly, <PER>Harry</PER> walked back to <PER>Harry</PER>, hardly knowing what to say or do.
<PER>Ron</PER> was breathing heavily: <PER>Harry</PER> eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue; their were also wet.
<PER>Harry</PER> stooped, pretending <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux.
<PER>Ron</PER> had pierced the glass in both windows: <PER>Riddle</PER>’s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> crammed the broken locket into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket, knelt down beside <PER>Ron</PER>, and placed a hand cautiously on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> took it as a good sign that <PER>Ron</PER> did not throw it off.
“After you left,” <PER>Harry</PER> said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that <PER>Ron</PER>’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet again and walked to where <PER>Ron</PER>’s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as <PER>Ron</PER> had run toward the pool to save <PER>Harry</PER> from drowning.
<PER>Harry</PER> hoisted it onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s own back and walked back to <PER>Ron</PER>, who clambered to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet as <PER>Harry</PER> approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.
“I’ve been trying to tell you that for years.” Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, <PER>Harry</PER> gripping the still-sopping back of <PER>Ron</PER>’s jacket.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not wait to wake <PER>Hermione</PER>, and it was with quickening excitement that <PER>Harry</PER> entered the tent, <PER>Ron</PER> lagging a little behind him.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was fast asleep, curled up under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s blankets, and did not move until <PER>Harry</PER> had said <PER>Hermione</PER>'s name several times.
<PER>Harry</PER> backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off <PER>Ron</PER>’s rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas.
<PER>Hermione</PER> slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward <PER>Ron</PER>, her eyes upon his pale face.
<PER>Hermione</PER> stopped right in front of him, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lips slightly parted, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes wide.
<PER>Hermione</PER> launched <PER>Hermione</PER> forward and started punching every inch of him that <PER>Hermione</PER> could reach.
“You — crawl — back — here — after — weeks — and — weeks — oh, where’s my wand?” She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hands and <PER>Harry</PER> reacted instinctively.
“Protegol” The invisible shield erupted between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>: The force of it knocked her backward onto the floor.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You come back after weeks — weeks — and you think it’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry?” “Well, what else can I say?” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, and <PER>Harry</PER> was glad that <PER>Ron</PER> was fighting back.
“Rack your brains, <PER>Ron</PER>, that should only take a couple of seconds — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” interjected <PER>Harry</PER>, who considered this a low blow, “he just saved my — ” “I don’t care!” she screamed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were dead, you don’t know what it’s been like — ” “What it’s been like for you?” Her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but Her had reached a level of indignation that rendered Her's temporarily speechless, and <PER>Ron</PER> seized his opportunity.
“I wanted to come back the minute I’d Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I couldn’t go anywhere!” “A gang of what?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> threw herself down into a chair with herself's arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that herself would unravel them for several years.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered: It had been the first time <PER>Ron</PER>’s name had been said aloud by either of them since the day <PER>Harry</PER> had left; <PER>Hermione</PER> had mentioned it when talking about repairing <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand.
“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you know?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together automatically.
They explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded, <PER>Hermione</PER> frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard <PER>Hermione</PER> forgot to keep <PER>Hermione</PER>'s limbs locked together.
“Well, it — it screamed,” said <PER>Harry</PER> with half a glance at <PER>Ron</PER>.
Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, <PER>Harry</PER> removed the Shield Charm with a wave of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand and turned to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?” “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been watching <PER>Hermione</PER> examining the locket.
“Mine’s broken.” “You’re kidding?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, but at that moment <PER>Hermione</PER> got to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, and he looked apprehensive again.
<PER>Hermione</PER> put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bed and settled down without another word.
<PER>Ron</PER> passed <PER>Harry</PER> the new wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not expected <PER>Hermione</PER>’s anger to abate overnight, and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning.
During those few moments <PER>Harry</PER> spent alone with <PER>Harry</PER>, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), <PER>Ron</PER> became shamelessly cheery.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of Gryffindor’s sword, and above all, <PER>Ron</PER>’s return, made <PER>Harry</PER> so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face.
Late in the afternoon he and <PER>Ron</PER> escaped <PER>Hermione</PER>’s baleful presence again, and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news.
<PER>Harry</PER> had finally managed to tell <PER>Ron</PER> the whole story of <PER>Harry</PER>'s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric’s Hollow; <PER>Ron</PER> was now filling <PER>Harry</PER> in on everything <PER>Harry</PER> had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during <PER>Harry</PER>'s weeks away. "
“But I haven’t got a problem calling him V — ” “NO!” roared <PER>Ron</PER>, causing <PER>Harry</PER> to jump into the hedge and <PER>Hermione</PER> (nose buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them.
“Sorry,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, wrenching <PER>Harry</PER> back out of the brambles, “but the name’s been jinxed, <PER>Harry</PER>, that’s how they track people!
“<PER>Harry</PER> you don’t reckon it could’ve been <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> what?” <PER>Ron</PER> looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> the doe?
“Tonks’s changed, didn’t it?” “Yeah, but if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was alive, why wouldn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> show <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
Partly to change the subject, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Speaking of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “Oh yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER> at once, “people are talking about it quite a lot.
<PER>Harry</PER> took aim at it with the wand <PER>Ron</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> the previous night, which <PER>Hermione</PER> had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of blackthorn.
“I’m sorry I said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was young, okay?” <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten <PER>Ron</PER>’s hatred of spiders.
Every minor spell <PER>Harry</PER> had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those <PER>Harry</PER> had produced with <PER>Harry</PER>'s phoenix wand.
“You just need to practice,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to enlarge and reduce the spider.
Keen for them all to be friends again, however, He agreed; but when <PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Hermione</PER> a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind shis book once more.
Sitting in the entrance, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet; but <PER>Harry</PER>'s magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was lying on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bunk reading, while <PER>Ron</PER>, after many nervous glances up at <PER>Hermione</PER>, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it.
For ten minutes or so <PER>Ron</PER> tapped and muttered, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned the pages of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s book, and <PER>Harry</PER> continued to practice with the blackthorn wand.
Finally <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed down from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bunk.
<PER>Hermione</PER> did not deign to respond, but approached <PER>Harry</PER>.
It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on his in there; his was not sure his felt up to hearing <PER>Rita</PER>’s version of his relationship with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He hated seeing absolute proof that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> really had written those words, that they had not been <PER>Rita</PER>’s invention.
“Er — what are you — ?” said <PER>Ron</PER> tentatively, but <PER>Hermione</PER> quelled him with a look and turned back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We keep trying to convince We <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left us secret signs and clues — ” “The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” piped up <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I think <PER>Hermione</PER>’s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.” <PER>Harry</PER> threw him a dark look.
<PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure that <PER>Ron</PER>’s support of <PER>Hermione</PER> had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune.
“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” <PER>Ron</PER> added, “Lovegood’s on your side, <PER>Harry</PER>, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone everyone’ve got to help you!” “I’m sure this is important!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> earnestly.
“But don’t you think if it was, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have told me about it was before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died?” “Maybe maybe it’s something you need to find out for yourself,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a faint air of clutching at straws.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sycophantically, “that makes sense.” “No, it doesn’t,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but I still think we ought to talk to Mister Lovegood.
“Outvoted, <PER>Harry</PER>, sorry,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, clapping him on the back.
They walked for a few hours, <PER>Harry</PER>, at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak.
When <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> caught up with <PER>Harry</PER>, panting and clutching stitches in <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s sides, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> grinning broadly.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth.
“You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” Xenophilius did not take <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, although the eye that was not pointing inward at <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose slid straight to the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“Why have you come here?” Before <PER>Harry</PER> could speak, however, <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a small cry of shock.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, embarrassed, “now’s not the moment — ” “But <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s an Erumpent horn!
<PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that <PER>Harry</PER> was undergoing some painful internal struggle.
“Well, I agree with <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said, shoving the tray into <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms and joining <PER>Harry</PER> at the statue’s side.
“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” <PER>Harry</PER> turned to look at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I assume that you are all familiar with “The Tale of the Three Brothers’?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “No,” but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both said, “Yes.” Xenophilius nodded gravely.
“Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,” said <PER>Harry</PER> before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, of course.” “But,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Hermione</PER>'s restraint starting to crack, “Mister Lovegood, how can you possibly believe — ?” “Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius.
She, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> glanced at one another, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew that they were all thinking the same thing.
“I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.” “So the Elder Wand,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, before <PER>Hermione</PER> could retort, “you think that exists too?” “Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said Xenophilius.
Finally <PER>Hermione</PER> asked stiffly, “Mister Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?” Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in <PER>Harry</PER>’s memory, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not locate it.
“It’s just a morality tale, It’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d choose — ” The three of them spoke at the same time; <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “the Cloak,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, “the wand,” and <PER>Harry</PER> said, “the stone.” They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused.
“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but you wouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grinned at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> was, after all, ridiculous.
<PER>Harry</PER> wand, <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night <PER>Voldemort</PER> had pursued <PER>Voldemort</PER> across the skies.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings.
Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces: <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>.
What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that the chains were actually one word, repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends friends friends <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great rush of affection for Luna.
“What’s wrong?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked as <PER>Harry</PER> descended the staircase, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> drew their wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his pocket.
<PER>Hermione</PER> stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand still pointing at Mister Lovegood.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, look at this.” <PER>Harry</PER> strode over to her as quickly as <PER>Harry</PER> could through all the clutter.
“The Quibbler’s going for a new angle, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked coldly, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind working very fast.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized their mistake just in time: <PER>Harry</PER> launched <PER>Harry</PER> sideways, shoving <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> out of harm’s way as Xenophilius’s Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn.
<PER>Harry</PER> flew through the air, then crashed to the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
He heard <PER>Hermione</PER>’s scream, <PER>Ron</PER>’s yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off him's feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs.
Half buried in rubble, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to raise <PER>Harry</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> could barely breathe or see for dust.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> gasp, and <PER>Harry</PER> had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over <PER>Harry</PER>, immersing <PER>Harry</PER>'s body in its shadow.
“Come on,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.” <PER>Harry</PER> started to dig <PER>Harry</PER> out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase.
<PER>Ron</PER> was buried deepest: <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs.
While Xenophilius ’s banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, <PER>Hermione</PER> managed to free <PER>Ron</PER> with the use of a Hover Charm.
“Do you trust me, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what <PER>Hermione</PER> was waiting for.
They fell like boulders, <PER>Harry</PER> still holding onto Shis hand for dear life; there was a scream from below, and <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling.
<PER>Hermione</PER> twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears as she dragged <PER>Harry</PER> once more into darkness.
“Protego Totalum Salvio Hexia ” “That treacherous old bleeder!” <PER>Ron</PER> panted, emerging from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing the Invisibility Cloak to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of <PER>Harry</PER> before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!” “Why hide me, though?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Yeah, you are, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” agreed <PER>Harry</PER> fervently.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> must be alive, <PER>Hermione</PER> must!” “Then <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it?” “But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, <PER>Ron</PER>!” “You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s Invisibility Cloak — ” “ The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> firmly.
“No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!” “When my wand connected with <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s, it made my mum and dad appear and Cedric ” “But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Then, as she glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that it was fear: <PER>Harry</PER> had scared her with <PER>Harry</PER>'s talk of living with dead people.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story — ” “Fit everything in?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated.
“What did <PER>Dumbledore</PER> do with it after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> broke it open?” But <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” But he scarcely heard <PER>Hermione</PER>: he had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air.
The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it And then, with a gasp, he remembered — “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had my Cloak the night my parents died!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> voice shook and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could feel the color in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not care.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> again, but <PER>Harry</PER> was busy undoing the pouch around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck, his fingers shaking hard.
<PER>Harry</PER> Cloak was the third Hallow, and when <PER>Harry</PER> discovered how to open the Snitch <PER>Harry</PER> would have the second, and then all <PER>Harry</PER> needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then — But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and his stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken.
“That’s what he’s after.” The change in his voice made <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> look even more scared.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s after the Elder Wand.” <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s after the Elder Wandthe Elder Wand.” turned <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s after the Elder Wand.”'s back on their strained, incredulous faces.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was not seeking a new wand; <PER>Voldemort</PER> was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> looked out into the night, thinking.
Nobody could have told <PER>Voldemort</PER> The Tales of Beedle the Bard when <PER>Voldemort</PER> was a child, any more than <PER>Harry</PER> had heard them.
If <PER>Voldemort</PER> had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely <PER>Voldemort</PER> would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death?
<PER>Harry</PER> felt lightheaded with amazement at <PER>Harry</PER>'s discoveries.
It was a shock to see <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> standing exactly where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had left them, <PER>Hermione</PER> still holding Lily’s letter, <PER>Ron</PER> at her side looking slightly anxious.
“This is it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, trying to bring them inside the glow of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own astonished certainty.
“ — and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s chasing the third, but <PER>Voldemort</PER> doesn’t realize <PER>Voldemort</PER> just thinks it’s a powerful wand “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, moving across to <PER>Voldemort</PER> and handing <PER>Voldemort</PER> back Lily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.” “But don’t you see?
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was turning the Snitch over and over in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to <PER>Hermione</PER> that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real.
The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and him could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if <PER>Harry</PER> could just possess them all.
If only he had the stone, only he had the stone could ask <PER>Dumbledore</PER> these questions in person and <PER>Harry</PER> murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar would burn and show <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, because for the first time ever, <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> were united in wanting the very same thing .
It was as though a flame had been lit inside <PER>Harry</PER> that nothing, not <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s flat disbelief nor <PER>Ron</PER>’s persistent doubts, could extinguish.
He blamed <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed <PER>Harry</PER>’s so much that <PER>Harry</PER> felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes.
“Obsession?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low fierce voice, when <PER>Harry</PER> was careless enough to use the word one evening, after <PER>Hermione</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> off for <PER>Harry</PER>'s lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left the sign of the Hallows for <PER>Hermione</PER> to decipher, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had also, <PER>Harry</PER> remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch.
master of Death Why didn’t <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> understand?
“I thought it was <PER>Voldemort</PER> we were supposed to be fighting?” <PER>Hermione</PER> retorted, and <PER>Harry</PER> gave up on <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The only other thing that mattered to <PER>Harry</PER> was that <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar had begun to prickle again, although <PER>Harry</PER> did all <PER>Harry</PER> could to hide this fact from the other two.
<PER>Harry</PER> was worried that the connection between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever He had told <PER>Hermione</PER>, prized.
Somehow <PER>Harry</PER> connected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind as well as before.
As the weeks crept on, <PER>Harry</PER> could not help but notice, even through <PER>Harry</PER>'s new self-absorption, that <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to be taking charge.
Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because <PER>Harry</PER>’s descent into listlessness galvanized <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormant leadership qualities, <PER>Ron</PER> was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action.
He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but <PER>Ron</PER> insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, <PER>Harry</PER> was aware, to keep them moving.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when <PER>Ron</PER> shouted excitedly from inside the tent.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> gazed at one another in horror.
Half of <PER>Harry</PER> yearned to hear more, half of <PER>Harry</PER> was afraid of what might come next.
“And what would you say to <PER>Harry</PER> if you knew <PER>Harry</PER> was listening, Romulus?” “I’d tell <PER>Harry</PER> we’re all with <PER>Harry</PER> in spirit,” said Lupin, then hesitated slightly.
“And I’d tell <PER>Harry</PER> to follow <PER>Harry</PER>'s instincts, which are good and nearly always right.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, whose eyes were full of tears.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>” — all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’ party in his house.
“May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of <PER>Harry</PER>’s supporters against following <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s lead.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were still beaming.
Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; <PER>Harry</PER> had become so used to friendly voices's isolation <PER>Harry</PER> had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Like us.” “But did you hear what Fred said?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> excitedly; now the broadcast was over, <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts turned again toward <PER>Harry</PER>'s all-consuming obsession.
“I told you, <PER>Harry</PER>, I told you, we can’t say it anymore — we’ve got to put the protection back around we — quickly — it’s how they find — ” But <PER>Ron</PER> stopped talking, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew why.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop them, someone had rummaged through <PER>Harry</PER>'s pockets and removed the blackthorn wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched at <PER>Harry</PER>'s excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though <PER>Harry</PER> had suffered some violent allergic reaction.
<PER>Harry</PER> eyes had been reduced to slits through which <PER>Harry</PER> could barely see; <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses fell off as <PER>Harry</PER> was bundled out of the tent; all <PER>Harry</PER> could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> outside too.
There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: <PER>Ron</PER> grunted in pain and <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed, “No!
A thud told <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Ron</PER> had been cast down beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Greyback’s gloating voice from overhead, and <PER>Harry</PER> was rolled over onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
“I said,” repeated Greyback, and <PER>Harry</PER> received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain, “what happened to you?” “Stung,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
“<PER>Dudley</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’b Bardy,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that his mouth was full of blood.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still half blind, barely able to see anything through <PER>Harry</PER>'s puffed-up eyes.
“Anyone still got a wand?” “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> from either side of him.
“I think there is a <PER>Dudley</PER> in there.” <PER>Harry</PER> could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this?
So close So close With a huge effort of will <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind to <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, pulling <PER>Voldemort</PER> back to where <PER>Voldemort</PER> sat, tied to <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Dean, and Griphook in the darkness, listening to Greyback and Scabior.
“ ‘’ermione Granger,’ ” Scabior was saying, “ ‘the Mudblood who is known to be traveling with ’arry Potter.’ ” <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep he present, not to slip into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s scar was exquisitely painful, but <PER>Harry</PER> struggled with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s strength against the pull of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts: It had never been so important to remain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own right mind.
Nobody spoke: <PER>Harry</PER> sensed the gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s arm trembling against <PER>Harry</PER>.
Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where <PER>Harry</PER> sat, crouching down again to stare closely at <PER>Harry</PER>'s misshapen features.
“What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” he asked softly, his breath foul in <PER>Harry</PER>’s nostrils as <PER>Harry</PER> pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar.
“Don’t touch it!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled; <PER>Harry</PER> could not stop <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> might be sick from the pain of it.
“There was glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait — ” And seconds later <PER>Harry</PER>’s glasses had been rammed back onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER>, still fighting to remain present inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s own splitting head, could think of nothing to say: Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind — — He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress — No, He was <PER>Harry</PER>, tied up and wandless, in grave danger — — looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower — He was <PER>Harry</PER>, and they were discussing He's fate in low voices — — Time to fly “to the Ministry?” “To hell with the Ministry,” growled Greyback.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s scar seared again — — and <PER>Harry</PER> rose into the night, flying straight up to the window at the very top of the tower — " completely sure it’s him?
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Hermione</PER>’s breathing, fast and terrified.
<PER>Harry</PER> struggled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand, but it was hopeless: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were squeezed tightly against <PER>Harry</PER> on either side, <PER>Harry</PER> could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar seared more painfully still — — as <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor, inside the cell-like room — The prisoners lurched into one another as The prisoners landed in a country lane.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then <PER>Harry</PER> saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, for <PER>Harry</PER> was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower.
How long it would take <PER>Voldemort</PER> to get to this place, once <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was here, was another matter.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw a ghostly white shape above <PER>Harry</PER>, and realized it was an albino peacock.
<PER>Harry</PER> stumbled and was dragged onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet by Greyback; now <PER>Harry</PER> was staggering along sideways, tied back-to- back to the four other prisoners.
Closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s puffy eyes, <PER>Harry</PER> allowed the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar to overcome <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, wanting to know what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was doing, whether <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew yet that <PER>Harry</PER> was caught.
“What is this?” The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> fell on <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears.
He was panicking now: He could see no way out, and it was easier, as He's fear mounted, to block out <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, though <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar was still burning.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, come here.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare look directly at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but saw <PER>Harry</PER> obliquely: a figure slightly taller than <PER>Harry</PER> was, rising from an armchair, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.
Through the slits of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s own reflection for the first time since leaving Grimmauld Place.
“Well, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
He was keeping He's distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> was of looking at him.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, everything will be forgiv — ” “Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said Greyback menacingly.
Lucius approached <PER>Harry</PER> himself, came so close that <PER>Harry</PER> could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through <PER>Harry</PER>'s swollen eyes.
With his face a puffy mask, <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> was peering out from between the bars of a cage.
<PER>Harry</PER> was nearly thrown off <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light fell on <PER>Hermione</PER> instead.
“It’s them, Potter’s friends — <PER>Malfoy</PER>, look at him, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s ’s son's name — ?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> again, his back to the prisoners.
“I’d say I’ll get a bite or two, wouldn’t you, ginger?” <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Ron</PER> shaking.
“HERMIONE!” <PER>Ron</PER> bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together, so that <PER>Harry</PER> staggered.
“Shut up, <PER>Ron</PER>, we need to work out a way — ” “We need a plan, stop yelling — we need to get these ropes off — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>?” came a whisper through the darkness.
Craning around, <PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of their fellow prisoners: Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound <PER>Harry</PER> to the humans.
<PER>Harry</PER> tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs <PER>Hermione</PER> was screaming worse than ever, and next to him <PER>Ron</PER> was bellowing, “How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix scream.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, fetch the goblin, “<PER>Malfoy</PER> can tell us whether the sword is real or not!” <PER>Harry</PER> dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor.
“Griphook,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered into the goblin’s pointed ear, “you must tell them that sword’s a fake, them mustn’t know it’s the real one, Griphook, please — ” <PER>Harry</PER> could hear someone scuttling down the cellar steps; next moment, <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s shaking voice spoke from behind the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> hit <PER>Ron</PER> on the arm to stop him shouting, and <PER>Ron</PER> looked terrified at his mistake.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, “Dobby has come to rescue you.” “But how did you — ?” An awful scream drowned <PER>Harry</PER>’s words: <PER>Hermione</PER> was being tortured again.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> launched themselves upon him.
<PER>Ron</PER> seized Wormtail’s wand arm and forced Wormtail’s wand arm upward; <PER>Harry</PER> slapped a hand to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, muffling his voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not expected it: <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched <PER>Harry</PER> free, astonished, keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand over Wormtail’s mouth.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw the ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: <PER>Harry</PER> seemed just as shocked as <PER>Harry</PER> at what <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and <PER>Harry</PER> continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness.
The silver tool that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER>'s most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping Pettigrew's reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; his was being strangled before their eyes.
“No!” <PER>Ron</PER> had released Wormtail too, and together he and <PER>Harry</PER> tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail’s throat, but it was no use.
“Relashiol” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a dreadful scream from overhead.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail’s body on the floor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room.
“Is it the true sword?” <PER>Harry</PER> waited, holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, fighting against the prickling of <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar.
His true surroundings vanished: His was <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and the skeletal wizard before <PER>Voldemort</PER> was laughing toothlessly at <PER>Voldemort</PER>; <PER>Voldemort</PER> was enraged at the summons <PER>Voldemort</PER> felt — <PER>Voldemort</PER> had warned them, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had told them to summon <PER>Voldemort</PER> for nothing less than Potter.
Jets of light flew from <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s, Narcissa’s, and Greyback’s wands; <PER>Harry</PER> threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them.
Bellatrix was supporting <PER>Hermione</PER>, who seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s throat.
“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into <PER>Hermione</PER>’s throat: <PER>Harry</PER> saw beads of blood appear there.
“All right!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, and <PER>Harry</PER> dropped Bellatrix’s wand onto the floor at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions: <PER>Malfoy</PER> doubled over, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hands covering <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s bloody face.
As <PER>Ron</PER> ran to pull <PER>Hermione</PER> out of the wreckage, <PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s chance: <PER>Harry</PER> leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefyl” The werewolf was lifted off The werewolf's feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground.
“Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and Dobby's friends!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar was blinding <PER>Harry</PER> with pain.
Dimly <PER>Harry</PER> knew that they had moments, seconds before <PER>Voldemort</PER> was with them.
As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, of the streak of red that was <PER>Ron</PER>’s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix’s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing — Bill and Fleur’s Shell Cottage Bill and Fleur’s Fleur had disappeared into the unknown; all Fleur could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to take Fleur there.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, relinquished Dobby’s hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground.
There seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw movement outside it.
“Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, clutching the two wands <PER>Harry</PER> had brought from the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’, ready to fight if <PER>Harry</PER> needed to.
“HELP!” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all <PER>Harry</PER> cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that <PER>Harry</PER> had stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s thin arms to <PER>Harry</PER> with a look of supplication.
It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant <PER>Harry</PER> knelt again beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix’s silver knife.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf’s body, then dragged off <PER>Harry</PER>'s own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket.
The sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; <PER>Harry</PER> listened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which <PER>Harry</PER> could take no interest, making decisions.
<PER>Harry</PER> agreed without really knowing what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying.
As <PER>Harry</PER> did so, <PER>Harry</PER> gazed down at the tiny body, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar prickled and burned, and in one part of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> punishing those they had left behind at <PER>Malfoy</PER> Manor.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> rage was dreadful and yet <PER>Harry</PER>’s grief for Dobby seemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached <PER>Harry</PER> from across a vast, silent ocean.
He had learned control at last, learned to shut He's mind to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, the very thing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had wanted He to learn from <PER>Snape</PER>.
Just as <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not been able to possess <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER> was consumed with grief for Sirius, so <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts could not penetrate <PER>Harry</PER> now, while <PER>Harry</PER> mourned Dobby.
Grief, it seemed, drove <PER>Voldemort</PER> out though <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, of course, would have said that it was love.
On <PER>Harry</PER> dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming <PER>Harry</PER>'s grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar.
Deeper and deeper <PER>Harry</PER> sank into the grave, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew where <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been tonight, and whom <PER>Voldemort</PER> had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when <PER>Harry</PER> was rejoined by <PER>Ron</PER> and Dean.
“How’s <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Better,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Fleur’s looking after Fleur.” <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s retort ready for when they asked <PER>Harry</PER> why <PER>Harry</PER> had not simply created a perfect grave with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not need it.
<PER>Harry</PER> wrapped the elf more snugly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet; <PER>Ron</PER> put an arm around her when <PER>Hermione</PER> reached him.
“Now he could be sleeping.” <PER>Harry</PER> placed the elf into the grave, arranged <PER>Harry</PER>'s tiny limbs so that <PER>Harry</PER> might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body.
<PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> not to break down as <PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb.
When <PER>Harry</PER> stood up again, the stone read: <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar still prickling a little, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind full of those things that had come to <PER>Harry</PER> in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so <PER>Harry</PER> stood in the doorway, listening. "
If <PER>Ginny</PER>’d been at Hogwarts, they could have taken <PER>Ginny</PER>'s before we reached <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“I’m going to wash,” <PER>Harry</PER> told Bill, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, still covered in mud and Dobby’s blood.
Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent Dobby to the cellar, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen.
Help will always be given at Hog warts to those who ask for it <PER>Harry</PER> dried <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room.
<PER>Harry</PER> instinct was telling <PER>Harry</PER> one thing, <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain quite another.
The <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head smiled, surveying <PER>Harry</PER> over the tips of <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers, pressed together as if in prayer.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s clean hands and was momentarily surprised to see the cloth <PER>Harry</PER> was holding in them.
<PER>Harry</PER> set it down and returned to the hall, and as <PER>Harry</PER> did so, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar pulse angrily, and there flashed across <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building <PER>Harry</PER> knew extremely well.
“You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half- conscious goblin, <PER>Hermione</PER> looks as though <PER>Hermione</PER>’s been tortured, and <PER>Ron</PER>’s just refused to tell me anything — ” “We can’t tell you what We’re doing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> flatly.
“I need you two as well!” he called to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room.
“How are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“You were amazing — coming up with that story when <PER>Hermione</PER> was hurting you like that — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a weak smile as <PER>Ron</PER> gave her a one- armed squeeze.
“What are we doing now, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> moved to the window, turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on the spectacular view, and waited, <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms folded, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar prickling.
<PER>Hermione</PER> took the chair beside the dressing table; <PER>Ron</PER> sat on the arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> noted the goblin’s sallow skin, <PER>Harry</PER>'s long thin fingers, <PER>Harry</PER>'s black eyes.
While <PER>Harry</PER> tried to decide on the best way to approach <PER>Harry</PER>'s request, the goblin broke the silence.
Griphook looked at <PER>Harry</PER> out of the corners of <PER>Harry</PER>'s slanting black eyes.
“You are an unusual wizard, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” “In what way?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar absently.
<PER>Harry</PER> rather thought <PER>Harry</PER> was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to <PER>Harry</PER> whether Griphook approved of Dobby’s grave or not.
<PER>Harry</PER> gathered <PER>Harry</PER> for the attack.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very odd wizard.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.” The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen anything like <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I need to break into a Gringotts vault.” <PER>Harry</PER> had not meant to say it so baldly; the words were forced from <PER>Harry</PER> as pain shot through <PER>Harry</PER>'s lightning scar and <PER>Harry</PER> saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind firmly.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though he had gone mad.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — ” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was cut off by Griphook.
“It belongs to the Lestranges.” <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer.
“Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years?” (<PER>Ron</PER> fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s chair.)
“You can’t want You- Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!” The goblin gazed at <PER>Hermione</PER> with the same curiosity he had shown <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But — ” <PER>Ron</PER> started angrily; <PER>Hermione</PER> nudged him in the ribs.
Griphook did not protest, but <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him.
“He’s enjoying keeping us hanging.” “<PER>Harry</PER>,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the still-dark landing, “are you saying what I think you’re saying?
<PER>Harry</PER> was emaciated, the bones of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down on the empty bed, beside <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He knew, He was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to beat <PER>Voldemort</PER> to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s goal, or else to attempt to thwart him.
<PER>Harry</PER> took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck.
Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished, and did not look away until <PER>Harry</PER> had taken from <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket the two wands he had brought from the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’.
“I took this wand from <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> by force,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And <PER>Voldemort</PER> is interested in it, isn’t <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I — how?” croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> for help.
“he wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“He can’t know that, <PER>Harry</PER>, how could He — ?” “Priori Incantatem,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’, <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a reproachful look, and said, “Let’s not worry about that now — ” But Mister Ollivander intervened.
“But how — how do you — ?” “Never mind how I know it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes momentarily as <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar burned and <PER>Harry</PER> saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther north.
They all looked up at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> appeared in the doorway, but <PER>Harry</PER> merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> behind him.
The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and <PER>Harry</PER> walked back to it, as the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head built more and more powerfully.
him must make only one more short effort, so that him could explain to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let’s go and get it before <PER>Harry</PER> does!” “It’s too late for that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help <PER>Harry</PER>, but clutched <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, trying to help it resist.
“Leave me now.” <PER>Snape</PER> bowed and set off back up the path, <PER>Snape</PER>'s black cloak billowing behind <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly, waiting for <PER>Snape</PER> ’s figure to disappear.
It would not do for <PER>Snape</PER>, or indeed anyone else, to see where <PER>Harry</PER> was going.
But there were no lights in the castle windows, and <PER>Harry</PER> could conceal <PER>Harry</PER> and in a second <PER>Harry</PER> had cast upon <PER>Harry</PER> a Disillusionment Charm that hid <PER>Harry</PER> even from <PER>Harry</PER>'s own eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s hands were folded upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s chest, and there <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s hands lay, clutched beneath them, buried with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Had he thought that <PER>Voldemort</PER> would be scared to violate <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s tomb?
Wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, Wherever <PER>Harry</PER> could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature.
Wherever <PER>Harry</PER> spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on Wherever <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
The enormity of his decision not to race <PER>Voldemort</PER> to the wand still scared <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was full of doubts, doubts that <PER>Ron</PER> could not help voicing whenever they were together.
“What if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?” “What if working out what the symbol meant made you ‘worthy’ to get the Hallows?” <PER>Harry</PER>, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know- P a g e ?
<PER>Harry</PER> could not even explain satisfactorily why <PER>Harry</PER> had decided against it: Every time <PER>Harry</PER> tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to <PER>Harry</PER>'s decision, they sounded feebler to <PER>Harry</PER>.
The odd thing was that <PER>Hermione</PER>’s support made him feel just as confused as <PER>Ron</PER>’s doubts.
“You couldn’t have broken into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s grave.” But the idea of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s corpse frightened <PER>Harry</PER> much less than the possibility that <PER>Harry</PER> might have misunderstood the living <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s intentions.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt that <PER>Harry</PER> was still groping in the dark; <PER>Harry</PER> had chosen <PER>Harry</PER>'s path but kept looking back, wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> had misread the signs, whether <PER>Harry</PER> should not have taken the other way.
From time to time, anger at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> crashed over <PER>Dumbledore</PER> again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not explained before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had found <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument.
“Yes, he is, <PER>Ron</PER>, please don’t start that again!” “Look at the facts, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, speaking across <PER>Harry</PER>, who continued to gaze at the horizon.
“There you go!” said <PER>Ron</PER> quickly, before <PER>Hermione</PER> could carry on.
“If it wasn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “I can’t — but can you explain how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sent <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to we if <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?” “I dunno, it could’ve been his ghost!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
There was little about <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sure of now, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew that much.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have gone on.” “What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could say any more, a voice behind them said, “ ’Arry?” Fleur had come out of the cottage, Fleur's long silver hair flying in the breeze.
“Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you — ” “That’s great!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, relief surging through <PER>Harry</PER>.
Behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> said, “<PER>Harry</PER>’s having a laugh.
“Okay,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> turned back to face him, “how’s this?
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well tell <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> can have the sword after <PER>Harry</PER>’s helped us get into that vault — but us’ll be careful to avoid telling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> exactly when <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> can have it.” A grin spread slowly across <PER>Ron</PER>’s face.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, we can’t — ” “<PER>Harry</PER> can have it,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on, “after we’ve used it on all of the Horcruxes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at <PER>Hermione</PER>, afraid that <PER>Hermione</PER> might give the game away.
“I have your word, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> only emerged for mealtimes.
The longer they spent together, the more <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER> did not much like the goblin.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Harry</PER>'s distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it: they needed Griphook.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt responsible: It was, after all, <PER>Harry</PER> who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that <PER>Harry</PER> could question <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER>'s fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Arthur could no longer work.
“Don’t worry about us.” And when she tried to protest he went on, “We’ll be off your hands soon too, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I.
“Luna, we told you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> called over to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Well, more of a crown, really.” <PER>Ron</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and grinned; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius.
Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to Fleur's feet, Fleur's wand pointing at the door; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> did the same.
All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: <PER>Hermione</PER> and Fleur both squealed, “Congratulations!” and <PER>Ron</PER> said, “Blimey, a baby!” as if he had never heard of such a thing before.
“M-me?” stammered <PER>Harry</PER> “You, yes, of course — Dora quite agrees, no one better — ” “I — yeah — blimey — ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was the only one who had noticed this, until <PER>Harry</PER> saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up the stairs.
“Godfather, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said Bill as “Godfather, <PER>Harry</PER>!” walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the table.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re planning something with Griphook.” It was a statement, not a question, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not bother to deny It.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised <PER>Harry</PER> in return?” “I can’t tell you that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Their plans were made, Their's preparations complete; in the smallest bedroom a single long, coarse black hair (plucked from the sweater <PER>Hermione</PER> had been wearing at <PER>Malfoy</PER> Manor) lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece.
“And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, nodding toward the walnut wand, “so I reckon you’ll be pretty convincing.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked frightened that the wand might sting or bite <PER>Hermione</PER>'s as <PER>Hermione</PER> picked it up.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been surprised, but pleased, to discover that it worked for <PER>Harry</PER> at least as well as <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s had done.
Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s problem was: <PER>Hermione</PER> had not won the walnut wand’s allegiance by taking it personally from Bellatrix.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to <PER>Harry</PER>, but regretted <PER>Harry</PER>'s action at once: <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that the goblin had noticed.
It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, <PER>Harry</PER> was impressed to learn, <PER>Hermione</PER> had protected from the Snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s sock.
It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone together for more than five minutes at a time: “He could give my mother lessons,” growled <PER>Ron</PER>, as the goblin’s long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors.
<PER>Hermione</PER> disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that <PER>Harry</PER> had given up attempting to pick <PER>Hermione</PER>'s brains on how best to do it; <PER>Ron</PER>, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than “Well just have to wing it, mate.” <PER>Harry</PER> slept badly that night.
Lying awake in the early hours, <PER>Harry</PER> thought back to the way <PER>Harry</PER> had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, almost an excitement.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> was experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts: <PER>Harry</PER> could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept telling <PER>Harry</PER> that their plan was good, that Griphook knew what their were facing, that their were well-prepared for all the difficulties their were likely to encounter, yet still <PER>Harry</PER> felt uneasy.
Once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> stir and was sure that <PER>Harry</PER> too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so <PER>Harry</PER> did not speak.
He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but <PER>Harry</PER> ached with sadness to think of leaving <PER>Harry</PER> behind.
<PER>Harry</PER> fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck, through which <PER>Harry</PER> could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which <PER>Harry</PER> had been sure <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eye.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well that it was really <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> could not suppress a shiver of loathing.
She was taller than <PER>Harry</PER> was, Shis long black hair rippling down Shis back, Shis heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then She spoke, and him heard <PER>Hermione</PER> through Bellatrix’s low voice.
“There,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “how does he look, <PER>Harry</PER>?” It was just possible to discern <PER>Ron</PER> under his disguise, but only, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, because <PER>Harry</PER> knew him so well.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s hair was now long and wavy; <PER>Ron</PER>’s had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.
“I should climb up now, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, I think?” <PER>Harry</PER> bent down and the goblin clambered onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands linked in front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not heavy, but <PER>Harry</PER> disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which <PER>Harry</PER> clung on.
The goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet found pavement and <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes on Charing Cross Road.
“Good morning,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and as <PER>Harry</PER> crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.
“Too polite,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s ear as they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard.
The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place <PER>Harry</PER> had visited before <PER>Harry</PER>'s first term at Hogwarts so many years before.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s own face glared down at <PER>Harry</PER> from posters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across <PER>Hermione</PER>'s path.
“Why, Madam Lestrange!” <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around and Griphook tightened <PER>Harry</PER>'s hold around <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck: A tall, thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them.
“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear, but at that moment <PER>Harry</PER> could not think who Travers was.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had drawn <PER>Hermione</PER> up to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fullest height and said with as much contempt as <PER>Hermione</PER> could muster: “And what do you want?” Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.
“ He’s another Death Eater\” breathed Griphook, and <PER>Harry</PER> sidled sideways to repeat the information into <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s ear.
“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly, “but if my presence is not welcome ” <PER>Harry</PER> recognized <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice now; Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house.
“No, no, not at all, Travers,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, trying to cover up <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mistake.
“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the inhabitants of <PER>Malfoy</PER> Manor were confined to the house, after the ah escape.” <PER>Harry</PER> willed <PER>Hermione</PER> to keep <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
<PER>Ron</PER> sloped along beside them, and <PER>Harry</PER> and Griphook followed.
A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side, there was no means for <PER>Harry</PER> to communicate with <PER>Hermione</PER> or <PER>Ron</PER>.
Knowing that he had only seconds; <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, “Confundo” twice.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s long black hair rippled behind <PER>Hermione</PER>'s as <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed the steps.
He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at He's companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, “Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.” <PER>Hermione</PER> swept forward, <PER>Ron</PER> by her side, <PER>Harry</PER> and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to <PER>Harry</PER>: standing on this very spot on the day that <PER>Harry</PER> had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> standing beside <PER>Harry</PER> saying, “ Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed, and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass.
<PER>Hermione</PER> allowed Travers to step ahead of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear, “the Imperius Cursel” <PER>Harry</PER> raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed the hawthorn wand at the old goblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life, “Imperiol” A curious sensation shot down <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm, a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, down the sinews and veins connecting <PER>Harry</PER> to the wand and the curse it had just cast.
“But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?” <PER>Harry</PER> acted without thinking: Pointing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at Travers, <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, “Imperiol” once more.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at Travers, who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made <PER>Harry</PER>'s decision: With a flick of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand wand made Travers come with them, walking meekly in them's wake as them reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches.
“their’re Imperiused,” he added, in response to <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank.
“What are you making him do?” “Hide,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front with Griphook, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> crammed together in the back.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks: <PER>Harry</PER> hair flew behind <PER>Harry</PER> as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but <PER>Harry</PER> kept glancing back.
They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more <PER>Harry</PER> thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised <PER>Hermione</PER> as Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix’s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it — They were deeper than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever penetrated within Gringotts; They took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of They, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track.
Water filled <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes and mouth: <PER>Harry</PER> could not see or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of the cart.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard <PER>Hermione</PER> shriek something, and felt <PER>Harry</PER> glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor.
“C-Cushioning Charm,” <PER>Hermione</PER> spluttered, as <PER>Ron</PER> pulled her to her feet, but to <PER>Harry</PER>’s horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; <PER>Ron</PER> was red-haired and beardless again.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think I can hear people coming!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the waterfall and cried, “Protego\” They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway.
<PER>Harry</PER> was trying to listen: <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> could hear something clanking and moving around nearby.
“Griphook, how much farther?” “Not far, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, not far ” And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which <PER>Harry</PER> had been prepared, but which still brought all of them to a halt.
“You know what to do,” Griphook told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see it trembling, and as they drew nearer <PER>Harry</PER> saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guessed that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers.
<PER>Harry</PER> as they all hurried inside the vault had described Hufflepuff’s cup to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know what it looked like.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had lit their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them.
“It burned me!” moaned <PER>Hermione</PER>, sucking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s blistered fingers.
“Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless — and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!” “Okay, don’t touch anything!” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, but even as <PER>Harry</PER> said it, <PER>Ron</PER> accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded into being while <PER>Ron</PER> hopped on the spot, part of <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.
“Stand still, don’t move!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, clutching at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s wandlight passed over shields and goblin- made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher <PER>Harry</PER> raised the beam, until suddenly it found an object that made <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart skip and <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand tremble.
“It’s there, It’s up there\” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> pointed their wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>.
The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and back as <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then <PER>Harry</PER> heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and saw terror in their faces.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as the clanking grew louder, “I’ve got to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it — ” She raised Shis wand, pointed it at <PER>Harry</PER>, and whispered, “Levicorpus.” Hoisted into the air by his ankle, <PER>Harry</PER> hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped space.
With screams of pain <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate.
“Impervius\” screeched <PER>Hermione</PER> in an attempt to protect herself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and the goblins from the burning metal.
Then the worst scream yet made <PER>Harry</PER> look down: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view.
“Liberacorpus\” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, and with a crash <PER>Harry</PER> and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
“Get it!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin, as Griphook clambered onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects.
One hand holding tightly to a fistful of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hair, to make sure <PER>Harry</PER> did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s reach.
The goblin still astride him, <PER>Harry</PER> dived and caught it, and although <PER>Harry</PER> could feel it scalding <PER>Harry</PER>'s flesh <PER>Harry</PER> did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist, raining down upon <PER>Harry</PER> as the entrance of the vault opened up again and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> into the outer chamber.
Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure, <PER>Harry</PER> shoved the cup into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone.
Sliding from <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulders the moment he could, <PER>Harry</PER> had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, “Thieves!
Slipping on the hot metal, <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and knew that the only way out was through.
“Stupefyl” he bellowed, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw several wizard guards running around the corner.
Pointing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “Relashiol” The cuffs broke open with loud bangs.
“This way!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing goblins, <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted toward the blind dragon.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — what are you doing?” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Get up, climb up, come on — ” The dragon had not realized that The dragon was free: <PER>Harry</PER>’s foot found the crook of The dragon hind leg and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> up onto the crook of its hind leg back.
<PER>Harry</PER> stretched out an arm; <PER>Hermione</PER> hoisted herself up; <PER>Ron</PER> climbed on behind them, and a second later the dragon became aware that it was untethered.
With a roar it reared: <PER>Harry</PER> dug in <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, clutching as tightly as <PER>Harry</PER> could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, flat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crashing of rock and the dragon’s roars, <PER>Harry</PER> could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> yelling, “Defodiol” <PER>Hermione</PER> was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as the ceiling struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins: <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> copied <PER>Hermione</PER>, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells.
Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally dragon had room to stretch the dragon wings: Turning finally dragon horned head toward finally dragon could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> still clinging to its back, its forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from them's hinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky.
Crouching low over the beast’s neck, <PER>Harry</PER> clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s burned and blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill.
Behind <PER>Harry</PER>, whether from delight or fear <PER>Harry</PER> could not tell, <PER>Ron</PER> kept swearing at the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be sobbing.
After five minutes or so, <PER>Harry</PER> lost some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from the dragon underground prison as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced around constantly, imagining that <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar prickling.
<PER>Harry</PER> hands were numb with cold but <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare attempt to shift <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip.
“Is it my imagination,” shouted <PER>Ron</PER> after a considerable stretch of silence, “or are we losing height?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset.
The landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as <PER>Harry</PER> squinted over the side of the dragon, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight.
“Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!” They agreed, <PER>Hermione</PER> a little faintly, and now <PER>Harry</PER> could see the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water.
<PER>Harry</PER> slithered over the side of the dragon’s and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than <PER>Harry</PER> had estimated and <PER>Harry</PER> hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, reed-filled world.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had fallen.
As <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of the lake, The dragon flew on, the dragon wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant bank.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> struck out for the opposite shore.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> could have happily lain down and slept, <PER>Harry</PER> staggered to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, drew out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and started casting the usual protective spells around them.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, <PER>Harry</PER> joined the others.
<PER>Hermione</PER> handed <PER>Harry</PER> the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice <PER>Hermione</PER> had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them.
“That double-crossing little scab ” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket <PER>Harry</PER> had just taken off and set the Horcrux down on the grass in front of them.
“Will it be all right?” “You sound like <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s ribs ached, <PER>Harry</PER> felt lightheaded with hunger, but <PER>Harry</PER> lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat was raw.
“What are we going to do, though?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> finally, hiccuping <PER>Hermione</PER> back to seriousness.
“Maybe they’ll cover up — ” The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice were extinguished: Pain cleaved <PER>Harry</PER>’s head like a sword stroke.
<PER>Harry</PER> was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced <PER>Harry</PER>, and on the floor at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet knelt a small, quaking figure.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had always suspected him; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, dead on his orders; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, whose wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy — But surely if the boy had destroyed any of the boy's Horcruxes, he, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, would have known, would have felt it?
He, the greatest wizard of them all; He, the most powerful; he, the killer of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and of how many other worthless, nameless men: How could Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> not have known, if Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated?
True, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had thought that was because Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had no body to feel, being less than ghost.
Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hiding places, it was there that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would go first.
The lake, surely impossible though was there a slight possibility that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might have known some of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s past misdeeds, through the orphanage.
To tell <PER>Snape</PER> why the boy might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and <PER>Malfoy</PER>: Didn’t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes flew open as <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched <PER>Harry</PER> back to the present: <PER>Harry</PER> was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> knows, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s going to check where the others are, and the last one,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> was already on <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s feet, “is at Hogwarts.
“No, he was concentrating on warning <PER>Snape</PER>, he didn’t think about exactly where it is — ” “Wait, wait\” cried <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> caught up the Horcrux and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again.
“Can you imagine what <PER>Harry</PER>’s going to do once <PER>Harry</PER> realizes the ring and the locket are gone?
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> walked forward and took <PER>Hermione</PER>'s place between the other two.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains beyond the village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the heart <PER>Harry</PER>’s remembered, with piercing accuracy, how <PER>Harry</PER>’s had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; all this in a second, upon landing — and then, even as <PER>Harry</PER>’s relaxed <PER>Harry</PER>’s's grip upon <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms, it happened.
The air was rent by a scream that sounded like <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s when <PER>Voldemort</PER> had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in <PER>Harry</PER>’s body, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew immediately that their appearance had caused it.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Ron</PER>’s wrist as <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand; there were too many of them to Stun: Even attempting it would give away Stun's position.
“Disapparate now!” “Great idea,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could reply a Death Eater shouted, “We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting away!
“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> retreated down the side street, groping He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s way along the wall, trying not to make a sound.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths <PER>Harry</PER> detested, tasting despair on the air, closing in — <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand: <PER>Harry</PER> could not, would not, suffer the Dementor’s Kiss, whatever happened afterward.
It was of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> that he thought as he whispered, “Expecto Patronum).” The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight.
<PER>Harry</PER> had had no idea where they were, but now <PER>Harry</PER> saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust- strewn bar of the Hog’s Head Inn.
<PER>Harry</PER> drew the curtains tight shut, then pulled the Cloak off himself and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“How did you get this?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, walking across to Sirius’s mirror, the twin of the one <PER>Harry</PER> had broken nearly two years before.
“Right then,” said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat slumped dozily in their chairs.
“Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> rather timidly.
“Been reading <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, have you, missy?” Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that <PER>Hermione</PER> had turned red.
“Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to spare <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He met Aberforth ’s gaze, which was so strikingly like He's brother’s: The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought that Aberforth knew what <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking and despised <PER>Harry</PER> for it.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cared about <PER>Harry</PER>, very much,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low voice.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s face was wet with tears, and <PER>Ron</PER> was almost as pale as Aberforth.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt nothing but revulsion: <PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had not heard it, wished <PER>Harry</PER> could wash <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind clean of it.
“He thought He was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know He did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, remembering <PER>Dumbledore</PER> whimpering, pleading.
“Why didn’t he say to him, Take care of yourself, here’s how to survive’?” “Because,” said <PER>Harry</PER> before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer, “sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your own safety!
“Your brother knew how to finish <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> passed the knowledge on to me.
The longer <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Neville</PER>, the worse <PER>Harry</PER> appeared: One of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s general air of unkemptness suggested that <PER>Harry</PER> had been living rough.
Nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER>'s battered visage shone with happiness as <PER>Harry</PER> let go of <PER>Hermione</PER> and said again, “I knew you’d come!
“<PER>Hermione</PER> was all for keeping it as a pet — ” “Don’t exaggerate, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “But what have you been doing?
“These have been great,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, beaming at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
As <PER>Harry</PER> followed, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Neville</PER> call out to unseen people: “Look who it is!
The next moment, he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair ruffled, he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people: he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> might just have won a Quidditch final.
“Okay, okay, calm down!” <PER>Neville</PER> called, and as the crowd backed away, <PER>Harry</PER> was able to take in their surroundings.
“No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had not recognized until <PER>Harry</PER> spoke: Seamus’s face was bruised and puffy.
As <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and <PER>Harry</PER> was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s scream of fury vibrated inside <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s head.
With an enormous effort he pulled out of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and <PER>Ron</PER> holding him up.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Neville</PER> was saying.
He looked at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, trying to tell them without words that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes.
He was exercising all He's willpower to prevent He succumbing again to <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s rage: <PER>Voldemort</PER> scar was still burning.
“Well, there’s something we — <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I — need to do, and then we’ll get out of here.” Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore.
“What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?” “We haven’t come back to stay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar, trying to soothe the pain.
“Because ” In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about where they might commence their search, <PER>Harry</PER> found it difficult to gather <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> left the three of us a job,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to tell — I mean, — wanted we to do it, just the three of we.” “we’re —'s army,” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
“What we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “Then let us help!” said <PER>Neville</PER> angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart seemed to fail: <PER>Ginny</PER> was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan.
<PER>Ginny</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a radiant smile: <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how beautiful <PER>Ginny</PER> was, but <PER>Harry</PER> had never been less pleased to see <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Right behind Lee Jordan came <PER>Harry</PER>’s old girlfriend, <PER>Cho</PER> Chang.
“There isn’t one,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar was still burning so fiercely.
“You’ve got to stop this!” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> turned suddenly to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had warned <PER>Dumbledore</PER> against telling anyone but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about the Horcruxes.
But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had trusted <PER>Snape</PER>, and where had that led?
“Centuries ago, they say,” said <PER>Cho</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart sank.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s own disappointment was mirrored back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, <PER>Voldemort</PER> did not know: Either way, there was hardly any time left.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s on the move,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said quietly to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“How do we get out?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Over here.” <PER>Harry</PER> led <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase.
They were standing in a dark corridor: <PER>Harry</PER> pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map.
<PER>Harry</PER> had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on <PER>Harry</PER>'s safe passage through the place.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust <PER>Harry</PER> had seen at Luna’s house.
The sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before <PER>Harry</PER>, and even as <PER>Harry</PER> raised his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on shis forearm.
The moment shis finger touched the Mark, <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar burned savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and <PER>Harry</PER> was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing around <PER>Harry</PER> and there was triumph in <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart — They have the boy.
A loud bang brought <PER>Harry</PER> back to where <PER>Harry</PER> stood: Disoriented, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, but the witch before <PER>Harry</PER> was already falling forward; the witch before <PER>Harry</PER> hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled.
“They’re pleased!” “Yeah great ” <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind.
Then, just as <PER>Harry</PER> was wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door.
“I’ll Cruciate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it — and what’s <PER>Voldemort</PER> going to say?” ’s <PER>Voldemort</PER> shrieked, standing over ’s <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s sister and smacking ’s <PER>Voldemort</PER> on the forehead with ’s <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s fist.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Cloak off <PER>Harry</PER>, raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and said, “You shouldn’t have done that.” As Amycus spun around, <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, “Crucio\” The Death Eater was lifted off The Death Eater's feet.
“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, the blood thundering through <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain, “you need to really mean it.” “Potter!” whispered Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, clutching her heart.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s on the way.” “Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak.
“He already knows where I am.” In a distant part of <PER>Harry</PER>’s brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Voldemort</PER> sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> or Luna could act, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> rose to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s feet, pointed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wand at the groggy Death Eater, and said, “Imperio.” Amycus got up, walked over to Amycus's sister, picked up Amycus's wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and handed it over along with his own.
“Potter,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning to face him again with superb indifference to the Carrows’ predicament, “if <PER>Voldemort</PER> does indeed know that you are here — ” As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through <PER>Harry</PER>, setting <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar on fire, and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface — “Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and <PER>Harry</PER> came back: <PER>Harry</PER> was clutching Luna’s shoulder to steady <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students — ” “I know, Professor, but if <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the Death Eaters won’t be interested in anyone who’s Disapparating out of the Hog’s Head.” “There’s something in that,” she agreed.
The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and Luna hurried back down.
Along the corridors they raced, and one by one The Patronuses left them; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER>, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first: He felt in the pouch around He's neck for the Marauder’s Map, but before He could take it out, <PER>McGonagall</PER> too seemed to become aware of their company.
Hatred boiled up in <PER>Harry</PER> at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten the details of Severus <PER>Snape</PER> ’s appearance in the magnitude of <PER>Harry</PER>'s crimes, forgotten how <PER>Harry</PER>'s greasy black hair hung in curtains around <PER>Harry</PER>'s thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual black cloak, and <PER>Harry</PER> too was holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand ready for a fight.
<PER>Snape</PER> stepped nearer, and <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes flitted over Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> into the air around her, as if <PER>Snape</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was there.
<PER>Harry</PER> held <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand up too, ready to attack.
“I was under the impression,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, “that Alecto had apprehended an intruder.” “Really?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“And what gave you that impression?” <PER>Snape</PER> made a slight flexing movement of <PER>Snape</PER>'s left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into <PER>Snape</PER>'s skin.
“You Death Eaters have your own private means of communication, I forgot.” <PER>Snape</PER> pretended not to have heard <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> eyes were still probing the air all about her, and <PER>Snape</PER> was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what <PER>Snape</PER> was doing.
She brandished Shis wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of it bracket: <PER>Harry</PER>, about to curse <PER>Snape</PER>, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at <PER>Snape</PER> Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that <PER>McGonagall</PER> blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers: <PER>Snape</PER> avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast — “Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in them's nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.
<PER>Snape</PER> struggled free of the crushing arms and sent the crushing arms flying back toward <PER>Snape</PER>'s attackers: <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered.
When <PER>Harry</PER> looked up again, <PER>Snape</PER> was in full flight, <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after him: him hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, him heard <PER>McGonagall</PER> cry, “Coward!
<PER>Harry</PER> dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window.
“He jumped,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna ran into the room.
“You mean he’s dead?” <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at <PER>Harry</PER>'s sudden appearance.
“Unlike <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, he was still carrying a wand and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.” With a tingle of horror, <PER>Harry</PER> saw in the distance a huge, batlike shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.
“Professor!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands at <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, beckoning to <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna to follow her.
“Go and wake your students, Horace.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna ran after Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand.
“Now, Potter,” said <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “you and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.” They parted at the top of the next staircase, <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna running back toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement.
“That was Potter!” “ <PER>Harry</PER> Potted” “It was him, I swear, I just saw him!” But <PER>Harry</PER> did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting <PER>Harry</PER> at the foot of the stairs.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s on his way, they’re barricading the school — <PER>Snape</PER>’s run for it — What are you doing here?
“We’re fighting.” There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past he, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle.
“Why doesn’t <PER>Ginny</PER> stay here, then at least <PER>Ginny</PER>’ll be on the scene and know what’s going on, but <PER>Ginny</PER> won’t be in the middle of the fighting?” “That’s a good idea,” said Arthur firmly.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, you stay in this room, you hear me?” <PER>Ginny</PER> did not seem to like the idea much, but under <PER>Ginny</PER>'s father’s unusually stern gaze, <PER>Ginny</PER> nodded.
“Where’s <PER>Ron</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They said something about a bathroom,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, “not long after you left.” “A bathroom?” <PER>Harry</PER> strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of Requirement and checked the bathroom beyond.
However, as <PER>Harry</PER> skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, “And what if we want to stay and fight?” There was a smattering of applause.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Give me <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s voice, “and none shall be harmed.
Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found <PER>Harry</PER>, to hold <PER>Harry</PER> frozen in the glare of thousands of invisible beams.
Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with them's backs to <PER>Harry</PER>, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and <PER>Harry</PER>, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.
“Where are <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Haven’t you found — ?” began Arthur, looking worried.
“All right, leaders up here and we’ll divide up the troops!” “Potter,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, hurrying up to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, as students flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, “ Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?” “What?
Without <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to help him He could not seem to marshal He's ideas.
He could not see <PER>Ron</PER>’s or <PER>Hermione</PER>’s names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, He thought, be concealing them.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could only be one explanation: <PER>Voldemort</PER> feared that <PER>Harry</PER> already knew <PER>Harry</PER>'s Horcrux was connected to that House.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way <PER>Harry</PER> had come, now in pursuit of <PER>Harry</PER>'s one last hope.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as <PER>Harry</PER> could over the clamor.
“That’s her over there, <PER>Harry</PER>, the young woman with the long hair.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER> looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall.
Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, <PER>Harry</PER> saw shis at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from <PER>Harry</PER>.
Close to, <PER>Harry</PER> recognized Shis as a ghost <PER>Harry</PER> had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom <PER>Harry</PER> had never spoken.
“It’s about <PER>Voldemort</PER> — defeating <PER>Voldemort</PER> — or aren’t you interested in that?” her could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated as her replied, “Of course I — how dare you suggest — ?” “Well, help me, then!” her composure was slipping.
“There’s no time to explain — but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see <PER>Voldemort</PER> finished, you’ve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!” She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and a sense of hopelessness engulfed <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, you weren’t the first person <PER>Riddle</PER> wormed things out of,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
“<PER>Harry</PER> could be charming when <PER>Harry</PER> wanted.
<PER>Harry</PER> had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from the diadem hiding place, perhaps as soon as <PER>Harry</PER> left Hogwarts, before <PER>Harry</PER> even started work at Borgin and Burkes.
No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> must have put it there — “ — the night he asked for a job!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, finishing his thought.
“I beg your pardon?” “He hid the diadem in the castle, the night He asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to let <PER>Dumbledore</PER> teach!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> must’ve hidden the diadem on <PER>Harry</PER>'s way up to, or down from, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s office!
What hiding place had Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> discovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> believed would remain secret forever?
Lost in desperate speculation, <PER>Harry</PER> turned a corner, but <PER>Harry</PER> had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound’s attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet.
“I’ll see yer in a moment, there’s a good lad!” Beyond <PER>Hagrid</PER>, out in the dark night, <PER>Harry</PER> saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird, keening scream.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch: It was midnight.
“Blimey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” panted <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “this is it, eh?
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, <PER>Harry</PER> could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds.
“Where’re we goin’?” puffed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, pounding along at <PER>Harry</PER>’s heels, making the floorboards quake.
“I dunno exactly,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making another random turn, “but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> must be around here somewhere.
The shock shot through <PER>Harry</PER> with the heat of firewhisky, and <PER>Harry</PER> nearly stumbled.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for <PER>Harry</PER>.
Of course, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had strayed off the beaten track in <PER>Harry</PER>'s time at school — here at last was a secret he and <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never discovered — he was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by <PER>Neville</PER> and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.
“Mandrakes!” <PER>Neville</PER> bellowed at <PER>Harry</PER> over his shoulder as <PER>Harry</PER> ran.
“Going to lob them over the walls — they won’t like this!” <PER>Harry</PER> knew now where to go: <PER>Harry</PER> sped off, with <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Fang galloping behind him.
“It’s all righ’, Fang — it’s all righ’!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> alone.
<PER>Harry</PER> forged on through the trembling passages, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clanking along in him's armor, screaming encouragement, him's fat little pony cantering behind him.
“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels out, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, see Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels off!” <PER>Harry</PER> hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway.
“I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!” “I know, we’re evacuating,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s “ — attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah,” said Aberforth, “I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him.
Well, it was the truth, <PER>Harry</PER> thought as <PER>Harry</PER> ran on again; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had defended <PER>Snape</PER> for so long, would never have held students ransom.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury <PER>Harry</PER> saw them: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, <PER>Ron</PER> with a broomstick under his arm.
“It was <PER>Ron</PER>, all <PER>Ron</PER>’s idea!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms: great curved fangs, torn, <PER>Harry</PER> now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk.
“Show him, <PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> made a horrible strangled hissing noise.
It was empty except for three women: <PER>Ginny</PER>, Tonks, and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom <PER>Harry</PER> recognized immediately as <PER>Neville</PER>’s grandmother.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too.
<PER>Ron</PER> threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted <PER>Hermione</PER> off her feet.
“Is this the moment?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
“I know, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, “so it’s now or never, isn’t it?” “Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“D’you think you could just — just hold it in until we’ve got the diadem?” “Yeah — right — sorry — ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and he and <PER>Hermione</PER> set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.
It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the nearest window, <PER>Harry</PER> saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that <PER>Harry</PER> knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place.
Looking down, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring <PER>Harry</PER>'s displeasure.
“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: <PER>Harry</PER> turned and saw <PER>Ginny</PER> and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes.
“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw Aberforth again, <PER>Harry</PER>'s gray hair flying as <PER>Harry</PER> led a small group of students past.
<PER>Ginny</PER> turned, helpless, to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“They’ll be all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, though <PER>Harry</PER> knew They were empty words.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe — come on!” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant.
I need the place where everything is hidden, <PER>Harry</PER> begged of it inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and the door materialized on their third run past.
“Somewhere near here,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Through the small space between their leering faces he saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Not anymore,” panted <PER>Harry</PER>, tightening <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip on the hawthorn wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not hear <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> anymore.
“So how come you three aren’t with <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s Potter <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants, who cares about a die-dum?” “Potter came in here to get it,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> with ill- disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues, “so that must mean — ” “ ‘Must mean?” Crabbe turned on <PER>Malfoy</PER> with undisguised ferocity.
“STOP!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> shouted at Crabbe, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s voice echoing through the enormous room.
“But if I can, I will, <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants him dead anyway, what’s thediff— ?” A jet of scarlet light shot past <PER>Harry</PER> by inches: <PER>Hermione</PER> had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe ’s head.
“ Expelliarmusl” Goyle ’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve the spot; <PER>Malfoy</PER> jumped out of range of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s second Stunning Spell, and <PER>Ron</PER>, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking terrified; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them.
“What can we do?” “Here!” <PER>Harry</PER> seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to <PER>Ron</PER>, who pulled <PER>Hermione</PER> onto it behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see a trace of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere: <PER>Harry</PER> swooped as low as <PER>Harry</PER> dared over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed <PER>Ron</PER>, though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke.
“It’s — too — dangerous — !” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, but <PER>Harry</PER> wheeled in the air.
<PER>Harry</PER> glasses giving <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes some small protection from the smoke, <PER>Harry</PER> raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood.
And <PER>Harry</PER> saw them: <PER>Malfoy</PER> with <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and <PER>Harry</PER> dived.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> coming and raised one arm, but even as <PER>Harry</PER> grasped it <PER>Harry</PER> knew at once that it was no good: Goyle was too heavy and <PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s — roared <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and <PER>Hermione</PER> dragged Goyle onto he and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as <PER>Malfoy</PER> clambered up behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed <PER>Malfoy</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear, and <PER>Harry</PER> sped up, following <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara — “ What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s that way\” screamed <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> made a hairpin swerve and dived.
The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist — <PER>Harry</PER> swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; ] wrist — <PER>Harry</PER> soared upward and straight toward the place where, ] wrist — <PER>Harry</PER> prayed, the door stood open: <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Goyle had vanished; <PER>Malfoy</PER> was screaming and holding <PER>Harry</PER> so tightly it hurt.
Then, through the smoke, <PER>Harry</PER> saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at a rectangular patch on the wall, and moments later clean air filled <PER>Harry</PER>'s lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.
<PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious.
“C-Crabbe,” choked <PER>Malfoy</PER> as soon as <PER>Harry</PER> could speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> staggered to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all around him.
“Where’s <PER>Ginny</PER>?” Where’s <PER>Ginny</PER>?
“Shall we split up and look — ?” “No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, getting to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet too.
Suddenly <PER>Harry</PER> felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, and as it did so, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
“Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose hair, like <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, was singed, and whose face was blackened.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then the man dueling Percy's hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair — “Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort.
They had been grouped together, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> flying through the air, and all <PER>Harry</PER> could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was <PER>Harry</PER>'s one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of He's companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them — And then the world resolved the world into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack.
And <PER>Hermione</PER> was struggling to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart.
<PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood.
“Get down!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, as more curses flew through the night: <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had both grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> and pulled <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred’s body, shielding Fred’s body from further harm, and when <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, “Percy, come on, we’ve got to move!” Percy shook Percy's head.
“Percy!” <PER>Harry</PER> saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating <PER>Ron</PER>’s face as <PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s elder brother’s shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge.
Then more curses came soaring over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head, so close <PER>Harry</PER> felt the force of them blow <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair.
“Let’s move, NOW!” Pushing <PER>Hermione</PER> ahead of him with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> stooped to seize Fred’s body under the armpits.
“Here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and they placed <PER>Harry</PER> in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than <PER>Harry</PER> had to, and after making sure that the body was well hidden, <PER>Harry</PER> took off after <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, <PER>Harry</PER> saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes <PER>Harry</PER> could not tell.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, in here!” <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed.
She had pulled <PER>Ron</PER> behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second <PER>Harry</PER> thought that They were embracing again; then <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hermione</PER> was trying to restrain <PER>Ron</PER>, to stop him running after Percy.
But <PER>Harry</PER> knew how <PER>Ron</PER> felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge; <PER>Harry</PER> too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that <PER>Ginny</PER> was not — but <PER>Harry</PER> could not permit that idea to form in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind — “We will fight!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said.
“You need to find out where <PER>Voldemort</PER> is, because hell have the snake with <PER>Voldemort</PER>, won’t he?
<PER>Voldemort</PER> closed <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and the bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them.
He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem although <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s puppet had come much farther than <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had ever expected too far .
He turned: There was Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> had received after the boy’s last escape.
“Go and fetch <PER>Snape</PER>.” “<PER>Snape</PER>, m-my Lord?” <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> continued to stand there, twirling the wand between <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s fingers, staring at it.
“It is the only way, Nagini,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> whispered, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space <PER>Voldemort</PER> had made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank.
With a gasp, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled back and opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes; at the same moment <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle.
“You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as soon as I — ” “No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and — ” “Don’t even think about it,” <PER>Ron</PER> snarled at her.
Before <PER>Hermione</PER> could get farther than “<PER>Ron</PER>, I’m just as capable — ” the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open.
Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before Two masked Death Eaters's wands were fully raised, <PER>Hermione</PER> shouted, “Glisseo\” The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters’ Stunning Spells flew far over their heads.
“Duro\” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, pointing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it.
“Get back!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>, and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> flattened <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherded by a sprinting Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
As she turned the corner, they heard shis scream, “CHARGE!” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you get the Cloak on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if their cast curses.
“Argh!” A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over <PER>Ron</PER>’s head; the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair as <PER>Ron</PER> tried to shake them loose.
“LET’S GO!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
“I’m <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I’m <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I’m on your side!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death Eater.
<PER>Harry</PER> Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked around, beaming, for <PER>Harry</PER>'s savior, and <PER>Ron</PER> punched <PER>Harry</PER> from under the Cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> directed a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit <PER>Neville</PER>, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sped down the marble staircase: Glass shattered to their left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as people ran.
“NO!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>, and with a deafening blast from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly stirring body of Lavender Brown.
“How do we get out?” yelled <PER>Ron</PER> over all the screaming, but before either <PER>Harry</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer they were bowled aside: <PER>Hagrid</PER> had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing <PER>Harry</PER>'s flowery pink umbrella.
<PER>Harry</PER> forgot everything else: <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted out from under the Cloak, running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was not even halfway to <PER>Hagrid</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> saw it happen: <PER>Hagrid</PER> vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, <PER>Hagrid</PER> buried in their midst.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard someone calling <PER>Harry</PER>'s own name, whether friend or foe <PER>Harry</PER> did not care: <PER>Harry</PER> was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with the spiders's prey, and <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing of <PER>Hagrid</PER> at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as <PER>Harry</PER> made to chase after them, <PER>Harry</PER>'s way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which <PER>Harry</PER> stood shudder.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up: A giant stood before <PER>Harry</PER>, twenty feet high, A giant head hidden in shadow, nothing but A giant treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors.
With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon <PER>Harry</PER>, forcing <PER>Harry</PER> back under the shelter of the doorway.
“Oh my — !” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> caught up with <PER>Harry</PER> and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above.
“DONT!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, grabbing <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand as she raised shis wand.
“RUN!” <PER>Harry</PER> roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and <PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, <PER>Ron</PER> bringing up the rear.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not lost hope of finding and saving <PER>Hagrid</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again.
The air around them had frozen: <PER>Harry</PER>’s breath caught and solidified in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> closed in beside <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred was gone, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was surely dying or already dead.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice from a very long way away.
He saw <PER>Ron</PER>’s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; He saw <PER>Hermione</PER>’s otter twist in midair and fade; and He's own wand trembled in He's hand, and He almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling .
And then a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s heads: The dementors fell back before the creatures’ approach.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked round: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were following <PER>Harry</PER>, but the other three had vanished back into the battle.
“The Whomping Willow,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “go!” Somehow Somehow walled it all up in Somehow's mind, crammed it into a small space into which Somehow could not look now: Thoughts of Fred and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and his terror for all the people his loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, because that was, as <PER>Hermione</PER> said, the only way to end it — He sprinted, half believing He could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around He, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, He ran faster than He had ever moved in He's life, and it was He who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at the great tree roots with whiplike, slashing branches.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> caught up, <PER>Hermione</PER> so out of breath <PER>Hermione</PER> could not speak.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> wanted <PER>Harry</PER> to do this, wanted <PER>Harry</PER> to come.
Was he leading <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> into a trap?
But then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: The only way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was at the end of this tunnel.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, we’re coming, just get in there!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pushing <PER>Harry</PER> forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> went first, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came.
They moved in silence, <PER>Harry</PER>’s gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist.
<PER>Hermione</PER> tugged at <PER>Harry</PER>'s ankle.
Then <PER>Snape</PER> spoke, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart lurched: <PER>Snape</PER> was inches away from where <PER>Snape</PER> crouched, hidden. "
my Lord, their resistance is crumbling — ” “ — and it is doing so without your help,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s high, clear voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of <PER>Harry</PER> gleaming slightly in the semidarkness.
“Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?” In the silence <PER>Harry</PER> imagined <PER>Harry</PER> could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled — or was it <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s sibilant sigh lingering on the air?
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see <PER>Harry</PER>'s face: <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Snape</PER> sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure <PER>Harry</PER>'s master.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> started to move around the room: <PER>Harry</PER> lost sight of <PER>Harry</PER> for seconds as <PER>Voldemort</PER> prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” “I — I cannot answer that, my Lord.” “Can’t you?” The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through <PER>Harry</PER>’s head: He forced He's own fist into He's mouth to stop He from crying out in pain.
He closed He's eyes, and suddenly He was <PER>Voldemort</PER>, looking into <PER>Snape</PER>’s pale face.
“My Lord — let me go to the boy — ” “All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s voice barely louder than a whisper, “wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for it rightful owner and I think I have the answer.” <PER>Snape</PER> did not speak.
It did nothing to <PER>Snape</PER>, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: But then <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s intention became clear.
The snake’s cage was rolling through the air, and before <PER>Snape</PER> could do anything more than yell, The snake’s cage had encased him, head and shoulders, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> spoke in Parseltongue.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face losing the little color <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face had left; <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face whitened as <PER>Harry</PER>'s black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs pierced his neck, as his failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and himself fell to the floor.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> turned away; there was no sadness in <PER>Voldemort</PER>, no remorse.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent floated after <PER>Voldemort</PER> in its huge protective sphere.
Back in the tunnel and <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own mind, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes: <PER>Harry</PER> had drawn blood biting down on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knuckles in the effort not to shout out.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” breathed <PER>Hermione</PER> behind him, but him had already pointed him's wand at the crate blocking him's view.
<PER>Harry</PER> took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down upon the man <PER>Harry</PER> hated, whose widening black eyes found <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent over <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER> seized the front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> close.
Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew what it was, but did not know what to do — A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> lifted the silvery substance into the silvery substance with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
When the flask was full to the brim, and <PER>Snape</PER> looked as though there was no blood left in <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>'s grip on <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes slackened.
The hand holding <PER>Harry</PER> thudded to the floor, and <PER>Snape</PER> moved no more.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained kneeling at <PER>Snape</PER>’s side, simply staring down at <PER>Harry</PER>, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that <PER>Harry</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, the flask gripped tightly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, thinking that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had reentered the room.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER> was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if him stood beside them, him's breath on the back of them's necks, a deathblow away.
<PER>Harry</PER> gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what to feel, except shock at the way <PER>Snape</PER> had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done.
They crawled back through the tunnel, none of They talking, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> could still hear <PER>Voldemort</PER> ringing in their heads, as <PER>Voldemort</PER> could.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see Fred’s body, because <PER>Harry</PER>'s family surrounded him.
Without a word to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked away.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> approach <PER>Ginny</PER>, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her.
<PER>Ron</PER> joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around <PER>Ron</PER>’s shoulders.
As <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved closer to the rest of the family, <PER>Harry</PER> had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if <PER>Harry</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> up in the first place, Fred might never have died.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of <PER>Snape</PER>’s last thoughts, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not slow down until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office.
“Password?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> without thinking, because it was <PER>Harry</PER> whom <PER>Harry</PER> yearned to see, and to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase behind.
But when <PER>Harry</PER> burst into the circular office <PER>Harry</PER> found a change.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced hopelessly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it.
The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where The stone Pensieve had always been: <PER>Harry</PER> heaved The stone Pensieve onto the desk and poured <PER>Snape</PER>’s memories into the wide basin with the desk runic markings around the edge.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell headlong into sunlight, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet found warm ground.
When <PER>Harry</PER> straightened up, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> was in a nearly deserted playground.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” <PER>Snape</PER> could no longer contain <PER>Snape</PER>, but had jumped out from behind the bushes.
<PER>Snape</PER> seemed to regret <PER>Snape</PER>'s appearance.
With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, <PER>Snape</PER> lowered <PER>Snape</PER>'s voice and said, “I know what you are.” “What do you mean?” “You’re you’re a witch,” whispered <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was highly colored now, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered why <PER>Snape</PER> did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because <PER>Snape</PER> did not want to reveal the smock beneath the smock.
<PER>Snape</PER> flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like <PER>Snape</PER>'s older self.
He stood watching them as them marched through the playground gate, and <PER>Harry</PER>, the only one left to observe him, recognized <PER>Snape</PER> ’s bitter disappointment, and understood that <PER>Snape</PER> had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong .
The scene dissolved, and before <PER>Harry</PER> knew it, re- formed around <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> had removed <PER>Snape</PER>'s coat now; <PER>Snape</PER>'s odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light. "
“Definitely,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, and even with <PER>Snape</PER>'s poorly cut hair and <PER>Snape</PER>'s odd clothes, <PER>Snape</PER> struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in <PER>Snape</PER>'s destiny.
<PER>Snape</PER> picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what <PER>Snape</PER> was doing.
“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but <PER>Snape</PER> had jumped to <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around: <PER>Harry</PER> was on platform nine and three-quarters, and <PER>Snape</PER> stood beside <PER>Harry</PER>, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly resembled <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> had already changed into <PER>Snape</PER>'s school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off <PER>Snape</PER>'s dreadful Muggle clothes.
<PER>Snape</PER> glanced at <PER>Snape</PER> and then looked back out of the window.
“Slytherin?” One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or <PER>Snape</PER> until that point, looked around at the word, and <PER>Harry</PER>, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like <PER>Snape</PER>, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that <PER>Snape</PER> so conspicuously lacked.
<PER>Harry</PER> was standing right behind <PER>Snape</PER> as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces.
Then Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said, “Evans, Lily!” <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> dropped the Sorting Hat onto Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, “ Gryffindoii” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Snape</PER> let out a tiny groan.
Lily took off the hat, handed the hat back to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as Lily went Lily glanced back at <PER>Snape</PER>, and there was a sad little smile on Lily's face.
her took one look at <PER>Harry</PER>, seemed to recognize <PER>Harry</PER> from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table.
At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> called <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked with him to the stool, watched <PER>Harry</PER> place the hat upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
And Severus <PER>Snape</PER> moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted <PER>Snape</PER> on the back as <PER>Snape</PER> sat down beside <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried to catch up with Lily and <PER>Snape</PER>, to listen in.
As <PER>Harry</PER> reached them, <PER>Harry</PER> realized how much taller they both were: A few years seemed to have passed since them's Sorting. "
<PER>Harry</PER> watched again as <PER>Snape</PER> left the Great Hall after sitting <PER>Harry</PER>'s O.W.L.
But <PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s distance this time, because <PER>Harry</PER> knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; him knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again.
Distantly he heard <PER>Snape</PER> shout at <PER>Snape</PER>'s in <PER>Snape</PER>'s humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “MudbloocL.” The scene changed.
The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until <PER>Harry</PER>'s surroundings solidified again and <PER>Harry</PER> stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees.
His fear infected <PER>Harry</PER> too, even though <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> could not be harmed, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, wondering what it was that <PER>Snape</PER> was waiting for — Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: <PER>Harry</PER> thought of lightning, but <PER>Snape</PER> had dropped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.
He stood before <PER>Snape</PER> with He's robes whipping around <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER>'s face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand.
“How much did you relay to Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” “Everything — everything I heard!” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was slumped forward in a chair and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing over <PER>Snape</PER>, looking grim.
After a moment or two, <PER>Snape</PER> raised <PER>Snape</PER>'s face, and <PER>Snape</PER> looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.
“If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved Lily Evans, then your way forward is clear.” <PER>Snape</PER> seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s words appeared to take a long time to reach <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was pacing up and down in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“ — mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent — ” “You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, without raising <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today.
<PER>Snape</PER> was muttering incantations, pointing <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand his tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s throat.
“That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain That ring is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio.
The news that <PER>Snape</PER> had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to say more on the subject of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further.
Scowling, <PER>Snape</PER> said, “The Dark Lord does not expect <PER>Malfoy</PER> to succeed.
“That, I think, is <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s plan.” “Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> foresees a moment in the near future when “Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> will not need a spy at Hogwarts?” “““Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> believes the school will soon be in “Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s grasp, yes.” “And if it does fall into his grasp,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, almost, it seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students of Hogwarts?” <PER>Snape</PER> gave a stiff nod.
“Thank you, Severus ” The office disappeared, and now <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.
“Not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind means to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could <PER>Harry</PER> have the strength to do what must be done?” “But what must <PER>Harry</PER> do?” “That is between <PER>Harry</PER> and me.
“Tell him that on the night Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> tried to kill him, when Lily cast Lily's own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and a fragment of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building.
“You have kept <PER>Snape</PER> alive so that <PER>Snape</PER> can die at the right moment?” “Don’t be shocked, Severus.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> watched <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fly away, and as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s silvery glow faded <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned back to <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes were full of tears.
Now, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Snape</PER> talking to the portrait of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> behind <PER>Snape</PER>'s desk.
“You will have to give <PER>Voldemort</PER> the correct date of <PER>Harry</PER>’s departure from <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt and uncle’s,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> was flying alongside <PER>Snape</PER> on a broomstick through a clear dark night: <PER>Harry</PER> was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a <PER>Harry</PER> who was really George.
A Death Eater moved ahead of <PER>Snape</PER> and raised A Death Eater's wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back — “ Sectumsemprcd” shouted <PER>Snape</PER>.
Tears were dripping from the end of <PER>Snape</PER>'s hooked nose as <PER>Snape</PER> read the old letter from Lily.
Lots of love, Lily <PER>Snape</PER> took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and Lily <PER>Snape</PER>'s love, and tucked it inside his robes.
He approached the portrait of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and pulled at the portrait of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> side.
“And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to give Potter the sword?” said <PER>Snape</PER> as <PER>Snape</PER> swung a traveling cloak over <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later <PER>Harry</PER> lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room: <PER>Snape</PER> might just have closed the door.
Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought his was learning the secrets of victory, <PER>Harry</PER> understood at last that <PER>Harry</PER> was not supposed to survive.
Along the way, he was to dispose of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend <PER>Voldemort</PER>, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither could survive.
Of course there had been a bigger plan; <PER>Harry</PER> had simply been too foolish to see it, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that now.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never questioned <PER>Harry</PER>'s own assumption that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted <PER>Harry</PER> alive.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER>'s life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had passed the job of destroying them to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and obediently <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only <PER>Voldemort</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to life!
And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had known that <PER>Harry</PER> would not duck out, that <PER>Harry</PER> would keep going to the end, even though it was <PER>Harry</PER>'s end, because <PER>Harry</PER> had taken trouble to get to know <PER>Harry</PER>, hadn’t <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew, as <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew, that <PER>Harry</PER> would not let anyone else die for him now that him had discovered it was in his power to stop it.
But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had overestimated <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
One Horcrux remained to bind <PER>Voldemort</PER> to the earth, even after <PER>Harry</PER> had been killed.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would know what needed to be done, of course.
That would have been why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to confide in two others so that if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> fulfilled <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s true destiny a little early, they could carry on.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed a long way away, in a far- off country; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> felt as though <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had parted from them long ago.
Nearly half of the hour allotted by <PER>Voldemort</PER> for <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s surrender had elapsed.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Invisibility Cloak over <PER>Harry</PER> and descended through the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
Perhaps some tiny part of <PER>Harry</PER> hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Invisibility Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and <PER>Harry</PER> reached the front doors easily.
Then <PER>Neville</PER> nearly walked into <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced down and felt another dull blow to <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle had done.
<PER>Neville</PER> leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped <PER>Neville</PER>'s forehead with the back of <PER>Neville</PER>'s hand.
People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not see any of the people <PER>Harry</PER> loved, no hint of <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> would have given all the time remaining to <PER>Harry</PER> for just one last look at them; but then, would <PER>Harry</PER> ever have the strength to stop looking?
<PER>Harry</PER> moved toward <PER>Neville</PER>, who was bending over another body.
“<PER>Neville</PER>.” “Blimey, <PER>Harry</PER>, you nearly gave me heart failure!” <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to <PER>Harry</PER> out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re not thinking of handing yourself over?” “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied easily.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now <PER>Neville</PER> would take <PER>Harry</PER>’s place: There would still be three in the secret.
<PER>Neville</PER> patted <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder, released <PER>Harry</PER>, and walked away to look for more bodies.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung the Cloak back over <PER>Harry</PER> and walked on.
“I don’t want to fight anymore!” “I know,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>'s voice broke.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to shout out to the night, <PER>Harry</PER> wanted <PER>Ginny</PER> to know that <PER>Harry</PER> was there, <PER>Harry</PER> wanted <PER>Ginny</PER>'s to know where <PER>Harry</PER> was going.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>, the abandoned boys, had all found home here.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding <PER>Ginny</PER>'s hand.
With a huge effort <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> on.
He thought He saw <PER>Ginny</PER> look around as He passed, and wondered whether <PER>Ginny</PER> had sensed someone walking nearby, but He did not speak, and He did not look back.
All those visits to <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and <PER>Ron</PER> vomiting slugs, and <PER>Hermione</PER> helping him save Norbert him moved on, and now him reached the edge of the forest, and him stopped.
Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER> in life.
“Invisible to anyone else.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother.
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, but sure that <PER>Voldemort</PER> would find <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
The dead who walked beside his through the forest were much more real to his now than the living back at the castle: <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as his stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed them, knowing that them would lead <PER>Harry</PER> exactly where <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to go.
They had traveled on mere minutes when <PER>Harry</PER> saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that <PER>Harry</PER> knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing <PER>Harry</PER>'s long nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at the great blond Rowle's bleeding lip.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> raised <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s hand to silence She, and She did not speak another word, but eyed <PER>Voldemort</PER> in worshipful fascination.
“I thought he would come,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s high, clear voice, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s eyes on the leaping flames.
“You weren’t.” <PER>Harry</PER> said it as loudly as <PER>Harry</PER> could, with all the force <PER>Harry</PER> could muster: <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to sound afraid.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had frozen where <PER>Voldemort</PER> stood, but <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s red eyes had found <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> stared as <PER>Harry</PER> moved toward <PER>Harry</PER>, with nothing but the fire between them.
Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from <PER>Voldemort</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>, her breast heaving.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand against <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest, but <PER>Harry</PER> made no attempt to draw it.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if <PER>Harry</PER> managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first.
And still, <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each other, and now <PER>Voldemort</PER> tilted his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought inexplicably of <PER>Ginny</PER>, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his — <PER>Voldemort</PER> had raised — <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while <PER>Harry</PER> could still stand, before <PER>Harry</PER> lost control, before <PER>Harry</PER> betrayed fear — <PER>Harry</PER> saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone.
Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, <PER>Harry</PER> became conscious that <PER>Harry</PER> was naked.
Convinced as <PER>Harry</PER> was of <PER>Harry</PER>'s total solitude, this did not concern <PER>Harry</PER>, but this did intrigue <PER>Harry</PER> slightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether, as <PER>Harry</PER> could feel, <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to see.
In opening them, <PER>Harry</PER> discovered that <PER>Harry</PER> had eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist <PER>Harry</PER> had ever experienced before.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned slowly on the spot, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s surroundings seemed to invent themselves before <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was walking toward Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue.
“<PER>Harry</PER>.” Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spread Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s arms wide, and Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hands were both whole and white and undamaged.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat down in one of them, and <PER>Harry</PER> fell into the other, staring at <PER>Harry</PER>'s old headmaster’s face.
“Go on!” “So the part of his soul that was in me ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nodded still more enthusiastically, urging <PER>Harry</PER> onward, a broad smile of encouragement on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face. "
“But if <PER>Voldemort</PER> used the Killing Curse,” <PER>Harry</PER> started again, “and nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?” “I think you know,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Are you sure we can’t do anything?” “There is no help possible.” “Then explain more,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled.
“What you must understand, <PER>Harry</PER>, is that you and Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested.
“He killed me with your wand.” “He failed to kill you with your wand,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> corrected <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course,” he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.” “I feel great at the moment, though,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s clean, unblemished hands.
“Where would you say that we are?” Until <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had asked, <PER>Harry</PER> had not known.
Now, however, <PER>Harry</PER> found that <PER>Harry</PER> had an answer ready to give.
“Well?” For the first time since <PER>Harry</PER> had met <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, he looked less than an old man, much less.
“Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Not the way he did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
After all <PER>Harry</PER>'s anger at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend <PER>Dumbledore</PER> from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> closed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes for a moment and nodded.
“True.” <PER>Harry</PER> waited, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not speak, so <PER>Dumbledore</PER> prompted <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached out and was glad to find that <PER>Harry</PER> could touch <PER>Harry</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm tightly and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gradually regained control.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not ask whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had ever found out who struck Ariana dead.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to know, and even less did <PER>Harry</PER> want <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to have to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
At last <PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have seen when <PER>Harry</PER> looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over <PER>Harry</PER>.
At last <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Grindelwald tried to stop <PER>Voldemort</PER> going after the wand.
“They say <PER>Voldemort</PER> showed remorse in later years, alone in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s cell at Nurmengard.
After another short pause <PER>Harry</PER> said, “You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nodded.
“That bit didn’t work out.” The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat without talking for the longest time yet.
“I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?” “That is up to you.” “I’ve got a choice?” “Oh yes.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not dare open <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, but allowed <PER>Harry</PER>'s other senses to explore <PER>Harry</PER>'s predicament.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand was still stowed beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes because <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s pressed between <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest and the ground.
Desperate to see what was happening and why, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes by a millimeter.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> seemed to be getting to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes again and considered what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen.
“My Lord, let me — ” “I do not require assistance,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> coldly, and though <PER>Voldemort</PER> could not see it, <PER>Harry</PER> pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand.
Nobody approached <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press <PER>Harry</PER> harder into the ground, and <PER>Harry</PER> was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch.
him could only lie there, with him's heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though it was, that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was wary of approaching him, that <PER>Voldemort</PER> suspected that all had not gone to plan.
Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s shirt, down to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest, and felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s arms trembling with the force of <PER>Harry</PER>'s heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as <PER>Hagrid</PER> cradled <PER>Harry</PER> in his arms, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to <PER>Hagrid</PER> that all was not, yet, lost.
“Move,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> stumbled forward, forcing <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest.
Branches caught at <PER>Harry</PER>’s hair and robes, but <PER>Harry</PER> lay quiescent, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth lolling open, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while <PER>Hagrid</PER> sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter .
The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while <PER>Harry</PER> could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through <PER>Harry</PER>'s closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s unexpected bellow nearly forced <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes open.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered how many centaurs were watching how many centaurs's procession pass; <PER>Harry</PER> dared not open <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes to look.
“Stop.” <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Hagrid</PER> must have been forced to obey <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s command, because he lurched a little.
The fact of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own survival burned inside <PER>Harry</PER>, a talisman against them, as though his father’s stag kept guardian in his heart.
Someone passed close by <PER>Harry</PER>, and Someone knew that it was <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself because Someone spoke a moment later, Someone's voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the grounds, crashing upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s eardrums.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was so close to <PER>Voldemort</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare open <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes again.
“Come,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> move ahead, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was forced to follow.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes a fraction, and saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> striding in front of them, wearing the great snake Nagini around <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage.
But <PER>Harry</PER> had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” sobbed <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> ” <PER>Harry</PER> shut his eyes tight again.
<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> ” <PER>Harry</PER> knew that they were approaching the castle and strained <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see, even through <PER>Harry</PER>'s closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon <PER>Harry</PER> from the entrance hall.
he saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> standing a little in front of <PER>Voldemort</PER>, stroking Nagini’s head with a single white finger.
“You see?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Voldemort</PER> striding backward and forward right beside the place where <PER>Voldemort</PER> lay.
“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and there was relish in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s voice for the lie, “killed while trying to save himself — ” But <PER>Voldemort</PER> broke off: <PER>Harry</PER> heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; <PER>Voldemort</PER> opened <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s eyes an infinitesimal amount.
Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at <PER>Voldemort</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> saw the figure hit the ground, Disarmed, <PER>Voldemort</PER> throwing the challenger’s wand aside and laughing.
“But you are a pureblood, aren’t you, my brave boy?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> asked <PER>Neville</PER>, who stood facing <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s empty hands curled in fists.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold.
“Very well,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard more danger in the silkiness of <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice than in the most powerful curse.
“<PER>Neville</PER> here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and with a flick of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand, wand caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames.
Screams split the dawn, and <PER>Neville</PER> was aflame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not bear it: <PER>Harry</PER> must act — And then many things happened at the same moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, swung the Invisibility Cloak over <PER>Harry</PER>, and sprang to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, as <PER>Neville</PER> moved too.
In one swift, fluid motion, <PER>Neville</PER> broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon <PER>Neville</PER>; the flaming hat fell off <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle — The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye.
With a single stroke <PER>Neville</PER> sliced off the great snake’s head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet — Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, <PER>Harry</PER> cast a Shield Charm between <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> before the latter could raise his wand.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was in the center of the battle, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was striking and smiting all within reach.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not get a clear shot, but fought <PER>Harry</PER>'s way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced everyone who could walk's way inside.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by <PER>Hagrid</PER>, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa <PER>Malfoy</PER> running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was now dueling <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Slughorn, and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him — Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and like her master she dueled three at once: <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to their, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to <PER>Ginny</PER> that she missed death by an inch — He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than <PER>Voldemort</PER>, but before He had gone a few steps He was knocked sideways.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> turned in slow motion; <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s fury at the fall of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> raised <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand and directed it at Molly Weasley.
“Protego\” roared <PER>Harry</PER>, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> stared around for the source as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last.
The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other.
“I don’t want anyone else to try to help,” <PER>Harry</PER> said loudly, and in the total silence <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice carried like a trumpet call.
“You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was pulling the strings?” “Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
They were still moving sideways, both of They, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for <PER>Harry</PER> no face existed but <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s.
“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, “you must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?” “I believe both,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw shock flit across the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; <PER>Voldemort</PER> began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s screams; humorless and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall.
“Than I, than Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, who has performed magic that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> himself never dreamed of?” “Oh, himself dreamed of it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but himself knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.” “You mean himself was weak!” screamed <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been himself, what will be mine!” “No, himself was cleverer than you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “a better wizard, a better man.” “I brought about the death of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “You thought you did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but you were wrong.” For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> is dead\” <PER>Voldemort</PER> hurled the words at <PER>Harry</PER> as though they would cause <PER>Harry</PER> unendurable pain.
“His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and His will not return!” “Yes, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s dead,” said <PER>Harry</PER> calmly, “but you didn’t have <PER>Harry</PER> killed.
“Severus <PER>Snape</PER> wasn’t yours,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Severus <PER>Snape</PER> was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s Patronus was a doe,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “the same as my mother’s, because he loved my mother's for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children.
“It matters not whether <PER>Snape</PER> was mine or <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path!
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes whiten.
“Yes, I dare,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all.
“The true master of the Elder Wand was <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.” Blank shock showed in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s face for a moment, but then it was gone.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the high voice shriek as <PER>Harry</PER> too yelled <PER>Harry</PER>'s best hope to the heavens, pointing <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand: “Avada KedavraV’ “ Expelliarmus\ ” The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s green jet meet <PER>Harry</PER>'s own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last.
And <PER>Harry</PER>, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in <PER>Harry</PER>'s free hand as <PER>Voldemort</PER> fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was dead, killed by <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own rebounding curse, and <PER>Harry</PER> stood with two wands in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, staring down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s enemy’s shell.
The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him.
Then <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and Kingsley and <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Flitwick and Sprout, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of hundreds of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last — The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light.
They moved <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s body and laid <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s body in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him.
After a while, exhausted and drained, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> sitting on a bench beside Luna.
Everyone who heard looked around, and <PER>Harry</PER> slid the Cloak up over <PER>Harry</PER>, and got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> spotted <PER>Ginny</PER> two tables away; <PER>Ginny</PER> was sitting with <PER>Ginny</PER>'s head on <PER>Ginny</PER>'s mother’s shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk.
“Will you come with me?” They stood up at once, and together he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the Great Hall.
“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pushing open a door to let <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> through.
But first he owed an explanation to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth.
<PER>Harry</PER> had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where <PER>Harry</PER> had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made <PER>Harry</PER> cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of <PER>Voldemort</PER> But it was applause.
At last, <PER>Harry</PER> held up <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping the portraits's eyes and waiting eagerly for <PER>Harry</PER> to speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> directed <PER>Harry</PER>'s words at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, however, and chose them with enormous care.
“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> beamed.
“But of course, <PER>Harry</PER>, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!” “And then there’s this.” <PER>Harry</PER> held up the Elder Wand, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, <PER>Harry</PER> did not like to see.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> had succeeded.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion.
“I think <PER>Harry</PER>’s right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
“And quite honestly,” <PER>Harry</PER> turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for <PER>Harry</PER> in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring <PER>Harry</PER> a sandwich there, “I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.” ayue Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year.
Albus’s voice drifted back to <PER>Harry</PER> over the surrounding clamor; <PER>Harry</PER>'s sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello.
A group of four people faces only came into focus when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.
“Parked all right, then?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but no pressure.” “<PER>Ron</PER>\” Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.
“He doesn’t mean it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was no longer paying attention.
Catching <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye, Catching <PER>Harry</PER>’s nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away.
“Look who it is.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing there with <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s throat.
The new boy resembled <PER>Malfoy</PER> as much as Albus resembled <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.
“I don’t mind sharing with A1 — Teddy could have my room!” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, “you and A1 will share a room only when I want the house demolished.” <PER>Harry</PER> checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett’s.
“It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.” “Don’t forget to give <PER>Neville</PER> our love!” <PER>Ginny</PER> told James as she hugged him.
“See you at Christmas.” “Bye, Al,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER>'s son hugged him.
<PER>Harry</PER> crouched down so that Albus ’s face was slightly above <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
“Albus Severus,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quietly, so that nobody but <PER>Ginny</PER> could hear, and <PER>Ginny</PER> was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts.
The train began to move, and <PER>Harry</PER> walked alongside it, watching <PER>Harry</PER>'s son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching <PER>Harry</PER>'s son glide away from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’ll be all right,” murmured <PER>Ginny</PER>.
As <PER>Harry</PER> looked at her, <PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
