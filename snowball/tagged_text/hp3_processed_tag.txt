For another, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter really wanted to do <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved the tip of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as <PER>Harry</PER> looked for something that would help <PER>Harry</PER> write <PER>Harry</PER>'s essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.” The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph.
<PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s round glasses up the bridge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose, moved <PER>Harry</PER>'s flashlight closer to the book, and read: Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill between <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment.
The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that <PER>Harry</PER> never enjoyed <PER>Harry</PER>'s summer holidays.
For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon kept <PER>Harry</PER> as downtrodden as possible, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon would be able to squash the magic out of <PER>Harry</PER>.
The most they could do, however, was to lock away <PER>Harry</PER>’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid <PER>Harry</PER> to talk to the neighbors.
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Harry</PER>'s teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work.
One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for <PER>Harry</PER>’s least favorite teacher, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, who would be delighted to have an excuse to give <PER>Harry</PER> detention for a month.
<PER>Harry</PER> had therefore seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s chance in the first week of the holidays.
While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street would notice it too), <PER>Harry</PER> had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s books, and hidden some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s books in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> was particularly keen to avoid trouble with <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with <PER>Harry</PER>, all because he’d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation.
<PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER>, who was one of <PER>Harry</PER>’s best friends at Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards.
“Vernon Dursley speaking.” <PER>Harry</PER>, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice answer.
<PER>Ron</PER> obviously realized that he’d gotten <PER>Harry</PER> into trouble, because <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t called again.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s other best friend from Hogwarts, <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger, hadn’t been in touch either.
<PER>Harry</PER> suspected that <PER>Ron</PER> had warned <PER>Hermione</PER> not to call, which was a pity, because <PER>Hermione</PER>, the cleverest witch in <PER>Harry</PER>’s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.
So <PER>Harry</PER> had had no word from any of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wizarding friends for five long weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one.
Yet another unusual thing about <PER>Harry</PER> was how little <PER>Harry</PER> looked forward to <PER>Harry</PER>'s birthdays.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never received a birthday card in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face after a long time under the blankets.
<PER>Harry</PER>, though still rather small and skinny for <PER>Harry</PER>'s age, had grown a few inches over the last year.
<PER>Harry</PER> jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had been — stubbornly untidy, whatever <PER>Harry</PER> did to it.
The eyes behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses were bright green, and on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead, clearly visible through <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.
<PER>Harry</PER> had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead, where <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator.
But <PER>Harry</PER> had come face-to-face with <PER>Harry</PER> at Hogwarts.
Remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window, <PER>Harry</PER> had to admit <PER>Harry</PER> was lucky even to have reached <PER>Harry</PER>'s thirteenth birthday.
<PER>Harry</PER> scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring back to <PER>Harry</PER> with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise.
Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before <PER>Harry</PER> realized what <PER>Harry</PER> was seeing.
For a split second <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand on the window latch, wondering whether to slam it shut.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized the unconscious owl at once — <PER>Harry</PER>'s name was Errol, and <PER>Harry</PER> belonged to the <PER>Weasley</PER> family.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and grabbed Errol’s package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s first ever birthday card.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up the clipping, smoothed the clipping out, and read: MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE Arthur <PER>Weasley</PER>, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.
<PER>Harry</PER> scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across <PER>Harry</PER>'s face as <PER>Harry</PER> saw all nine of the <PER>Weasley</PER>s waving furiously at him, standing in front of a large pyramid.
Right in the middle of the picture was <PER>Ron</PER>, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the <PER>Weasley</PER>s, who were very nice and extremely poor.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up <PER>Ron</PER>’s letter and unfolded it.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered only too well the occasion when <PER>Ron</PER>’s old wand had snapped.
<PER>Harry</PER> now turned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s present and unwrapped it.
Bye — <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> put the Pocket Sneakoscope on Bye — <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his clock.
Dear <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon.
<PER>Harry</PER> laughed as <PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s letter aside and picked up her present.
“Wow, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.
<PER>Harry</PER> happened to be a very good Quidditch player; <PER>Harry</PER> had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams.
<PER>Harry</PER> put the leather case aside and picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s last parcel.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the Hogwarts gamekeeper.
<PER>Harry</PER> tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could unwrap it properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside the parcel snapped loudly — as though the parcel had jaws.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hagrid</PER> would never send <PER>Harry</PER> anything dangerous on purpose, but then, <PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t have a normal person’s view of what was dangerous.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached for the lamp on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, ready to strike.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> seized the rest of the wrapping paper in <PER>Harry</PER>'s other hand and pulled.
Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, <PER>Harry</PER> got down on <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and knees and reached toward it.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled around, threw <PER>Harry</PER> forward, and managed to flatten it.
Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as <PER>Harry</PER> clamped the struggling book tightly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms, hurried to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it.
The Monster Book shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so <PER>Harry</PER> threw The Monster Book down on the bed and reached for <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s card.
All the best, <PER>Hagrid</PER> It struck <PER>Harry</PER> as ominous that <PER>Hagrid</PER> thought a biting book would come in useful, but he put <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s card up next to <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, grinning more broadly than ever.
It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress <PER>Harry</PER> knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress <PER>Harry</PER> had never set foot there.
Deciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, <PER>Harry</PER> got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart <PER>Harry</PER>’d made for <PER>Harry</PER>, counting down the days left until <PER>Harry</PER>'s return to Hogwarts.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> took off <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing <PER>Harry</PER>'s three birthday cards.
Far from wishing <PER>Harry</PER> a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed <PER>Harry</PER> enter the room, but <PER>Harry</PER> was far too used to this to care.
<PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict: " The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous.
At Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked <PER>Harry</PER> around the shins with Aunt Marge's walking stick to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from beating Dudley at musical statues.
On her last visit, the year before <PER>Harry</PER> started at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER> had accidentally trodden on the tail of shis favorite dog.
Ripper had chased <PER>Harry</PER> out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call <PER>Harry</PER> off until past midnight.
“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.” “All right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly, “if she does when she’s talking to me.” “Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard <PER>Harry</PER>’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any — any funny stuff while she’s here.
“Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, choosing <PER>Harry</PER>'s words carefully, “it’ll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits — ” “St.
But <PER>Harry</PER> stood <PER>Harry</PER>'s ground.
“But if you sign my permission form,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal and everything.” <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if Uncle Vernon's teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in Uncle Vernon's temple.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back upstairs to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see the point of trying to make <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair lie flat.
Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach, knocking the wind out of <PER>Harry</PER>, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on <PER>Harry</PER>'s cheek.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge’s hugs because <PER>Harry</PER> was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.
But <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by <PER>Harry</PER>, so <PER>Harry</PER> began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged <PER>Harry</PER> to stay out of their way, which <PER>Harry</PER> was only too happy to do.
Aunt Marge, on the other hand, wanted <PER>Harry</PER> under Aunt Marge's eye at all times, so that Aunt Marge could boom out suggestions for <PER>Harry</PER>'s improvement.
Aunt Marge delighted in comparing <PER>Harry</PER> with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at <PER>Harry</PER>, as though daring <PER>Harry</PER> to ask why <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t got a present too.
“If there’s something rotten on the inside, there’s nothing anyone can do about it.” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to concentrate on <PER>Harry</PER>'s food, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands shook and <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was starting to burn with anger.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still an underage wizard, and <PER>Harry</PER> was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school.
<PER>Harry</PER> got through the next three days by forcing <PER>Harry</PER> to think about <PER>Harry</PER>'s Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him.
<PER>Harry</PER> really wanted to disappear into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom, but <PER>Harry</PER> met Uncle Vernon’s angry little eyes and knew <PER>Harry</PER> would have to sit it out.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never felt so angry in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> tore from the dining room before anyone could stop <PER>Harry</PER>, heading for the cupboard under the stairs.
“I’ve had enough.” And in the next moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving <PER>Harry</PER>'s heavy trunk behind <PER>Harry</PER>, Hedwig’s cage under <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> was several streets away before <PER>Harry</PER> collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat quite still, anger still surging through <PER>Harry</PER>, listening to the frantic thumping of <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart.
Would <PER>Harry</PER> be arrested, or would <PER>Harry</PER> simply be outlawed from the wizarding world?
Would <PER>Harry</PER> thought of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and his heart sank even lower.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure that, criminal or not, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would want to help <PER>Harry</PER> now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, <PER>Harry</PER> had no means of contacting them.
There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk, but the rest of the fortune <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents had left <PER>Harry</PER> was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak — but before <PER>Harry</PER> had found it, <PER>Harry</PER> straightened up suddenly, looking around <PER>Harry</PER> once more.
A funny prickling on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck had made <PER>Harry</PER> feel <PER>Harry</PER> was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent over <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand clenched on <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Lumos,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, and a light appeared at the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, almost dazzling <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> held it high over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them <PER>Harry</PER> saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> legs hit <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and <PER>Harry</PER> tripped.
His wand flew out of His's hand as His flung out an arm to break His's fall, and His landed, hard, in the gutter — There was a deafening BANG, and <PER>Harry</PER> threw up <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands to shield <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes against a sudden blinding light — With a yell, His rolled back onto the pavement, just in time.
They belonged, as <PER>Harry</PER> saw when <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air.
For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> wondered if <PER>Harry</PER> had been knocked silly by <PER>Harry</PER>'s fall.
<PER>Harry</PER> snatched up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand again and scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
Close up, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than <PER>Harry</PER> was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples.
One of the knees in <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans was torn, and the hand <PER>Harry</PER> had thrown out to break <PER>Harry</PER>'s fall was bleeding.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly remembered why <PER>Harry</PER> had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence.
“Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, flattening <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair over <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar.
“<PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, saying the first name that came into <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“Listen, how much would it be to get to London?” “Eleven Sickles,” said Stan, “but for firteen you get ’ot chocolate, and for fifteen you get an ’ot water bottle an’ a toofbrush in the color of your choice.” <PER>Harry</PER> rummaged once more in <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk, extracted <PER>Harry</PER>'s money bag, and shoved some gold into Stan’s hand.
There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have been able to sleep even if <PER>Harry</PER> had been traveling on a bus that didn’t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time.
<PER>Harry</PER> stomach churned as <PER>Harry</PER> fell back to wondering what was going to happen to <PER>Harry</PER>, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet.
“That man!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, forgetting <PER>Harry</PER>'s troubles for a moment.
“ ’Course ’e was on the Muggle news, <PER>Neville</PER>, where you been?” He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, removed the front page, and handed the front page to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You oughta read the papers more, <PER>Neville</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> held the paper up to the candlelight and read: BLACK STILL AT LARGE Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never met a vampire, but <PER>Harry</PER> had seen pictures of them in <PER>Harry</PER>'s Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.
“<PER>Harry</PER> murdered thirteen people?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, handing the page back to Stan, “with one curse?” “Yep,” said Stan, “in front of witnesses an’ all.
“What, <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, without thinking.
“ ’<PER>Cho</PER>o say ’is name for?” “Sorry,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily.
“Blimey, my ’eart’s goin’ that fast” “So — so Black was a supporter of <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> prompted apologetically.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t soon forget the look of terror on <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face when <PER>Harry</PER> had been told where <PER>Harry</PER> was going, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was one of the bravest people <PER>Harry</PER> knew.
The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and <PER>Harry</PER> lay, restless and miserable, on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feather bed.
After a while, Stan remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over <PER>Harry</PER>’s pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen.
“Right then, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said Stan, clapping his hands, “whereabouts in London?” “Diagon Alley,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and Hedwig’s cage onto the pavement.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> could turn, <PER>Harry</PER> felt a hand on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
“ ’Ow come you di’n’t tell us ’oo you are, eh, <PER>Neville</PER>?” said Stan, beaming at <PER>Harry</PER>, while Ernie’s owlish face peered interestedly over Stan’s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms despite the glow of the fire.
“I am <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I won’t deny that they are extremely angry, <PER>Harry</PER>, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.” <PER>Harry</PER> unstuck <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to <PER>Harry</PER> now.
“Now, have a crumpet, <PER>Harry</PER>, while I go and see if Tom’s got a room for you.” Fudge strode out of the parlor and <PER>Harry</PER> stared after him.
“No, no, I’m very sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>, but as I’m not your parent or guardian — ” “But you’re the Minister of Magic,” said <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe that <PER>Harry</PER>’d left Privet Drive only a few hours ago, that <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t expelled, and that <PER>Harry</PER> was now facing three Dursley-free weeks.
It took <PER>Harry</PER> several days to get used to <PER>Harry</PER>'s strange new freedom.
Never before had <PER>Harry</PER> been able to get up whenever <PER>Harry</PER> wanted or eat whatever <PER>Harry</PER> fancied.
<PER>Harry</PER> could even go wherever <PER>Harry</PER> pleased, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world, <PER>Harry</PER> felt no desire to break <PER>Harry</PER>'s word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.
<PER>Harry</PER> ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where <PER>Harry</PER> liked watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day’s shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast <PER>Harry</PER> would go out into the backyard, take out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where <PER>Harry</PER>'s fellow diners were showing one another fellow diners's purchases (“it’s a lunascope, old boy — no more messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (“personally, I won’t let any of the children out alone until he’s back in Azkaban”).
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have to do <PER>Harry</PER>'s homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now <PER>Harry</PER> could sit in the bright sunshine outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all <PER>Harry</PER>'s essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave <PER>Harry</PER> free sundaes every half an hour.
Once <PER>Harry</PER> had refilled <PER>Harry</PER>'s money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from <PER>Harry</PER>'s vault at Gringotts, <PER>Harry</PER> had to exercise a lot of self- control not to spend the whole lot at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to keep reminding <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player’s face when they lose a point).
<PER>Harry</PER> was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant <PER>Harry</PER> never had to take another Astronomy lesson.
But the thing that tested <PER>Harry</PER>’s resolution most appeared in <PER>Harry</PER>'s favorite shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he’d arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.
Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, <PER>Harry</PER> edged <PER>Harry</PER>'s way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most magnificent broom <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never wanted anything as much in <PER>Harry</PER>'s whole life — but <PER>Harry</PER> had never lost a Quidditch match on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when his had a very good broom already?
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t ask for the price, but <PER>Harry</PER> returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to the Apothecary to replenish <PER>Harry</PER>'s store of potions ingredients, and as He's school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, <PER>Harry</PER> visited Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones.
Most important of all, <PER>Harry</PER> had to buy <PER>Harry</PER>'s new schoolbooks, which would include those for <PER>Harry</PER>'s two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination.
<PER>Harry</PER> got a surprise as <PER>Harry</PER> looked in at the bookshop window.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s booklist out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and consulted it for the first time.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> understood why <PER>Hagrid</PER> had said it would come in useful.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt relieved; <PER>Harry</PER> had been wondering whether <PER>Hagrid</PER> wanted help with some terrifying new pet.
“Come to get your new books?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I need — ” “Get out of the way,” said the manager impatiently, brushing <PER>Harry</PER> aside.
“Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, tearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes away from the dog’s and dazedly consulting <PER>Harry</PER>'s booklist.
“Er — I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three.” <PER>Harry</PER> emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with <PER>Harry</PER>'s new books under <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing where his was going and bumping into several people.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind <PER>Harry</PER> and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER> in the mirror over the basin.
As the days slipped by, <PER>Harry</PER> started looking wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went for a sign of <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the real <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t stop to chat; <PER>Neville</PER> appeared to have mislaid <PER>Harry</PER>'s booklist and was being told off by <PER>Harry</PER>'s very formidable-looking grandmother.
<PER>Harry</PER> hoped she never found out that <PER>Harry</PER>’d pretended to be <PER>Neville</PER> while on the run from the Ministry of Magic.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that <PER>Harry</PER> would at least meet <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where He’d have lunch, when someone yelled <PER>Harry</PER>'s name and <PER>Harry</PER> turned.
“Finally!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> as he sat down.
“Did you really blow up your aunt, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a very serious voice.
“I didn’t mean to,” said <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Ron</PER> roared with laughter.
“I just — lost control.” “It’s not funny, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply.
“Honestly, I’m amazed <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t expelled.” “So am I,” admitted <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies — ” “What are you doing Muggle Studies for?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, rolling his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, while <PER>Ron</PER> sniggered.
“You could see if they’ve got anything for Scabbers, and <PER>Hermione</PER> can get <PER>Hermione</PER>'s owl.” So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie.
The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> waited, examining the cages.
Like nearly everything <PER>Ron</PER> owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to <PER>Ron</PER>’s brother Percy) and a bit battered.
“Scabbers!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, racing out of the shop after him; <PER>Harry</PER> followed.
As They reached it, <PER>Hermione</PER> came out, but <PER>Hermione</PER> wasn’t carrying an owl.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, that thing nearly scalped me!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“How are you?” “Fine, thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined Arthur with all their shopping.
Arthur put down Arthur's paper, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, who had always been very taken with <PER>Harry</PER>, seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw <PER>Harry</PER>, perhaps because <PER>Harry</PER> had saved shis life during their previous year at Hogwarts.
Percy, however, held out Percy's hand solemnly as though Percy and <PER>Harry</PER> had never met and said, “<PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>’s got other brothers to set <PER>Ginny</PER>'s an example, Mother,” said Percy loftily.
Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven <PER>Weasley</PER>s, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> ate <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s way through five delicious courses.
“Well, as we haven’t got one anymore,” said Mister <PER>Weasley</PER>, “ — and as I work there, they’re doing me a favor — ” His voice was casual, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help noticing that Arthur’s ears had gone red, just like <PER>Ron</PER>’s did when <PER>Ron</PER>’s was under pressure.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Percy were next door to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Percy had just closed and locked <PER>Ron</PER> and Percy's own trunk when <PER>Ron</PER> and Percy heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what was going on.
“I’ll get Scabbers’s stuff, I’m packed,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> went downstairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when <PER>Harry</PER> heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, not wanting them to know He’d heard them arguing, when the sound of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own name made <PER>Harry</PER> stop, then move closer to the parlor door.
“Do you really want to send <PER>Harry</PER> back to school with that hanging over <PER>Harry</PER>?
“You know what <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> are like, wandering off by themselves — themselves’ve even ended up in the Forbidden Forest!
<PER>Harry</PER> waited until <PER>Harry</PER> heard Mister and Molly’s bedroom door close, then headed back upstairs with The bottle of rat tonic.
<PER>Harry</PER> forced a laugh, went to give <PER>Ron</PER> the rat tonic, then shut <PER>Harry</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>'s room and lay down on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
He’d made <PER>Harry</PER> promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on <PER>Harry</PER>.
And <PER>Harry</PER> was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the <PER>Weasley</PER>s could look after <PER>Harry</PER> until <PER>Harry</PER> was on the train.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel more scared.
Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mister and Molly obviously thought <PER>Harry</PER> would be panic-stricken if <PER>Harry</PER> knew the truth.
But <PER>Harry</PER> happened to agree wholeheartedly with Molly that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> happened to be.
Didn’t people always say that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was the only person Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had ever been afraid of?
No, all in all, the thing that bothered <PER>Harry</PER> most was the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>'s chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero.
Nobody would want <PER>Harry</PER> to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact, <PER>Harry</PER> suspected <PER>Harry</PER>'s every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed.
Tom woke <PER>Harry</PER> the next morning with <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual toothless grin and a cup of tea.
<PER>Harry</PER> got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into Hedwig's cage when <PER>Ron</PER> banged his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.
They headed down to breakfast, where Arthur was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Molly was telling <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> about a love potion she’d made as a young girl.
“What were you saying?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> as they sat down.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no chance to speak to <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> in the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron’s narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and Hermes, Percy’s screech owl, perched on top in their cages.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come on.” Arthur marched <PER>Harry</PER> across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two old-fashioned dark green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive- looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.
<PER>Harry</PER> got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and, to <PER>Ron</PER>’s disgust, Percy.
Percy and <PER>Ginny</PER> suddenly appeared behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye, and they both turned away to hide they both's laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with Percy's chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his shiny badge.
Once the remaining <PER>Weasley</PER>s and <PER>Hermione</PER> had joined them, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> led the way to the end of the train, past packed compartments, to a carriage that looked quite empty.
Molly kissed all her children, then <PER>Hermione</PER>, and finally, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Do take care, won’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
“I’m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius Black can’t be worse than <PER>Voldemort</PER>, can <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” Arthur flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, swear to me you won’t go looking for Black.” <PER>Harry</PER> stared.
“Promise me, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Arthur, talking more quickly still, “that whatever happens — ” “Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me?” said <PER>Harry</PER> blankly.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran to the compartment door and <PER>Ron</PER> threw the compartment door open and stood back to let <PER>Harry</PER> on.
“I need to talk to you in private,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as the train picked up speed.
“Go away, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Oh, that’s nice,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> huffily, and <PER>Ginny</PER> stalked off.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off down the corridor, looking for an empty compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> checked on the threshold.
When he’d finished, <PER>Ron</PER> looked thunderstruck, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands over her mouth.
“Trouble usually finds me.” “How thick would <PER>Harry</PER> have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?” said <PER>Ron</PER> shakily.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was.
“It’s coming from your trunk, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, standing up and reaching into the luggage rack.
“It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol’s leg to send it to <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrewdly.
“In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack’s supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain — ” “ — and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you’re sucking them,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was plainly not listening to a word <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ — or we can ask Fred and George, they know every secret passage out of the castle — ” “<PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply.
“I don’t think <PER>Harry</PER> should be sneaking out of school with Black on the loose — ” “Yeah, I expect that’s what McGonagall will say when I ask for permission,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
“But if we’re with him,” said <PER>Ron</PER> spiritedly to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Black wouldn’t dare — ” “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, don’t talk rubbish,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Don’t let that thing out!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, but too late; Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched, yawned, and sprang onto <PER>Ron</PER>’s knees; the lump in <PER>Ron</PER>’s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks angrily away.
“Get out of here!” “<PER>Ron</PER>, don’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily.
Crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat, his squashed face turned toward <PER>Ron</PER>, his yellow eyes on <PER>Ron</PER>’s top pocket.
“I mean — — hasn’t died, has he?” “No, no, —’s breathing,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, taking the Cauldron Cake <PER>Harry</PER> passed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the window, they heard footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least favorite people appeared at the door: <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had been enemies ever since <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had met on <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s very first train journey to Hogwarts.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, who had a pale, pointed, sneering face, was in Slytherin House; he played Seeker on the Slytherin Quidditch team, the same position that <PER>Harry</PER> played on the Gryffindor team.
“Well, look who it is,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> in <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door.
“I heard your father finally got your father's hands on some gold this summer, <PER>Weasley</PER>,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“New teacher,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold <PER>Ron</PER> back.
“What were you saying, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s pale eyes narrowed; <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down again, <PER>Ron</PER> massaging <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>'s knuckles.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” hissed <PER>Hermione</PER>, pointing at Professor Lupin, “be careful ” But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.
“What’s going on?” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice from behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, that was my foot!” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s way back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
“D’you think we’ve broken down?” “Dunno ” There was a squeaking sound, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw the dim black outline of <PER>Ron</PER>, wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt her pass <PER>Harry</PER>, heard the door slide open again, and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.
“Who’s that?” “Who’s that?” “<PER>Ginny</PER>?” “<PER>Hermione</PER>?” “What are you doing?” “I was looking for <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “Come in and sit down — ” “Not here!” said <PER>Harry</PER> hurriedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear movements in <PER>Harry</PER>'s corner.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes darted downward, and what <PER>Harry</PER>’s saw made <PER>Harry</PER>’s's stomach contract.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s own breath catch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes rolled up into <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“W — what?” <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes; there were lanterns above <PER>Harry</PER>, and the floor was shaking — the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come back on.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were kneeling next to He, and above them He could see <PER>Neville</PER> and Professor Lupin watching.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt very sick; when <PER>Harry</PER> put up <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to push <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses back on, <PER>Harry</PER> felt cold sweat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> heaved him back onto his seat.
<PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>, both very pale.
“Here,” he said to <PER>Harry</PER>, handing <PER>Harry</PER> a particularly large piece.
“Are you sure you’re okay, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, watching <PER>Harry</PER> anxiously.
“No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking anxiously at <PER>Harry</PER> again.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t ask how Professor Lupin knew Professor Lupin's name.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned and saw the gigantic outline of <PER>Hagrid</PER> at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, <PER>Harry</PER> could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept looking at <PER>Harry</PER> sideways, as though frightened <PER>Harry</PER> might collapse again.
A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf <PER>Harry</PER> again; <PER>Harry</PER> leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes until they had passed the gates.
At last, The carriage swayed to a halt, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> got out.
As <PER>Harry</PER> stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear.
“Shove off, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose jaw was clenched.
“Did you faint as well, <PER>Weasley</PER>?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> loudly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> prodded <PER>Ron</PER> in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors.
<PER>Harry</PER> fought <PER>Harry</PER>'s way over to Shis with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall had a way of making Professor McGonagall feel Professor McGonagall must have done something wrong.
“Move along there, <PER>Weasley</PER>.” <PER>Ron</PER> stared as Professor McGonagall ushered <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor.
Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to sit down.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> going red in the face.
The thought of what <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> would say if <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had to go to the hospital wing was torture.
Professor McGonagall strode off toward Professor McGonagall's empty seat at the staff table, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gryffindor table.
He and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on either side of <PER>Ron</PER>, who had saved them seats.
<PER>Harry</PER> started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak, and <PER>Harry</PER> broke off.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was often described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn’t why <PER>Harry</PER> respected <PER>Harry</PER>.
You couldn’t help trusting Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and as <PER>Harry</PER> watched him beaming around at the students, him felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> paused again; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.
“Look at <PER>Snape</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
It was common knowledge that <PER>Snape</PER> wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even <PER>Harry</PER>, who hated <PER>Snape</PER>, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that expression only too well; it was the look <PER>Snape</PER> wore every time <PER>Harry</PER> set eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward to see <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was ruby-red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard.
“Who else would have assigned us a biting book?” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> started speaking again, they saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.
<PER>Harry</PER>, suddenly ravenous, helped <PER>Harry</PER> to everything <PER>Harry</PER> could reach and began to eat.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
It had been <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> who had cleared <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s name last year.
“Congratulations, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> squealed as they reached the teachers’ table.
<PER>Harry</PER> climbed the spiral stair with no thought in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head except how glad <PER>Harry</PER> was to be back.
They reached They's familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster beds, and <PER>Harry</PER>, looking around, felt <PER>Harry</PER> was home at last.
When <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story.
“Ignore him,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was right behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What’s up with you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “<PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sitting down on George’s other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.
“Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?” The only time <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> had faced each other in a Quidditch match, <PER>Malfoy</PER> had definitely come off worse.
Feeling slightly more cheerful, <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to sausages and fried tomatoes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was examining <PER>Hermione</PER>'s new schedule.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, “they’ve messed up your schedule.
“But — ” “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, what’s it to you if my schedule’s a bit full?” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped.
<PER>Harry</PER> was used to the subjects of Hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit one another, but <PER>Harry</PER> always enjoyed watching it.
“Aha!” he yelled, seeing <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Puffing loudly, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed the tightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew them had reached the classroom.
There were no doors off this landing, but <PER>Ron</PER> nudged <PER>Harry</PER> and pointed at the ceiling, where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.
“After you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning, so <PER>Harry</PER> climbed the ladder first.
<PER>Harry</PER> emerged into the strangest-looking classroom <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen.
<PER>Ron</PER> appeared at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> around the same round table.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to pull <PER>Harry</PER> together.
“My turn ” <PER>Ron</PER> peered into <PER>Harry</PER>’s teacup, his forehead wrinkled with effort.
“Let me see that, my dear,” she said reprovingly to <PER>Ron</PER>, sweeping over and snatching <PER>Harry</PER>’s cup from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Everybody knows about <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration.
Everyone had got to Everyone's feet, and slowly they crowded around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s table, pressing close to Professor Trelawney’s chair to get a good look at <PER>Harry</PER>’s cup.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t the only one who didn’t understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at Dean Thomas and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped Dean Thomas shrugged at Dean Thomas and Lavender Brown's hands to Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown's mouths in horror.
Everyone was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, everyone except <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor Trelawney’s chair.
“When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going to die or not!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, taking even <PER>Harry</PER> by surprise.
Even <PER>Ron</PER> was avoiding <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though <PER>Harry</PER> were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at <PER>Harry</PER>, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were about to drop dead at any moment.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Ron</PER> still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, “But what about <PER>Neville</PER>’s cup?” When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, cheer up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, pushing a dish of stew toward him.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, in a low, serious voice, “you haven’t seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?” “Yeah, I have,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone mad.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, if <PER>Harry</PER>’s seen a Grim, that’s — that’s bad,” he said.
“My — my uncle Bilius saw one and — and my uncle Bilius died twenty-four hours later!” “Coincidence,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> airily, pouring <PER>Hermione</PER> some pumpkin juice.
“You didn’t seem quite so confident when you were telling <PER>Harry</PER> it was a sheep,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> coolly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> slammed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> weren’t speaking to each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked beside them in silence as them went down the sloping lawns to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
<PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure <PER>Harry</PER> knew what they were talking about.
“That’s it — make sure yeh can see — now, firs’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books — ” “How?” said the cold, drawling voice of <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> took out <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, which <PER>Malfoy</PER> had bound shut with a length of rope.
“Look — He took <PER>Hermione</PER>’s copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound <PER>Hermione</PER>’s copy.
“Really witty, giving us books that try and rip us hands off!” “Shut up, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was looking downcast and <PER>Harry</PER> wanted <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s first lesson to be a success.
“That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a fit when I tell him — ” “Shut up, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated.
“Beau’iful, aren’ they?” <PER>Harry</PER> could sort of see what <PER>Hagrid</PER> meant.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, approached the fence cautiously.
Even <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had misgivings.
There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and Parvati whispered, “Oooh, no, <PER>Harry</PER>, remember your tea leaves!” <PER>Harry</PER> ignored them.
“Good man, <PER>Harry</PER>!” roared <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Easy, now, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> quietly.
“Tha’s it, <PER>Harry</PER> now, bow <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel much like exposing the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck to Buckbeak, but <PER>Harry</PER> did as <PER>Harry</PER> was told.
“Right — back away, now, <PER>Harry</PER>, easy does it — ” But then, to <PER>Harry</PER>’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent the hippogriff scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.
“Well done, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, ecstatic.
“Righ’ then, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was used to a broomstick; but <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything in front of <PER>Harry</PER> was covered with feathers.
Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before <PER>Harry</PER> was soaring upward.
It was nothing like a broomstick, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew which one <PER>Harry</PER> preferred; the hippogriff’s wings beat uncomfortably on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>, catching him under <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs and making <PER>Harry</PER> feel <PER>Harry</PER> was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand, <PER>Harry</PER> now felt <PER>Harry</PER> rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.
Buckbeak flew <PER>Harry</PER> once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit <PER>Harry</PER> had been dreading; <PER>Harry</PER> leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling <PER>Harry</PER> was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill- assorted feet hit the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> just managed to hold on and push <PER>Harry</PER> straight again.
“Good work, <PER>Harry</PER>!” roared <PER>Hagrid</PER> as everyone except <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered.
<PER>Neville</PER> ran repeatedly backward from <PER>Neville</PER>, which didn’t seem to want to bend its knees.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> practiced on the chestnut, while <PER>Harry</PER> watched.
“This is very easy,” <PER>Malfoy</PER> drawled, loud enough for <PER>Harry</PER> to hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you, you great ugly brute?” It happened in a flash of steely talons; <PER>Malfoy</PER> let out a high-pitched scream and next moment, <PER>Hagrid</PER> was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as his strained to get at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.
“Someone help me — gotta get him outta here — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> ran to hold open the gate as <PER>Hagrid</PER> lifted <PER>Malfoy</PER> easily.
As they passed, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that there was a long, deep gash on <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s arm; blood splattered the grass and <PER>Hagrid</PER> ran with <PER>Harry</PER>, up the slope toward the castle.
The Slytherins, still muttering about <PER>Hagrid</PER>, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.
“That was a really bad thing to happen in <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s first class, though, wasn’t it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking worried.
“Trust <PER>Malfoy</PER> to mess things up for Trust <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“They wouldn’t fire him, would They?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously, not touching <PER>Hermione</PER>'s steak-and-kidney pudding.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure they were cooking up their own version of how <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been injured.
“There’s a light on in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s window,” <PER>Harry</PER> said suddenly.
When they reached <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, “C’min.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s lap.
“Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a teacher who lasted on’y a day before.” “You haven’t been fired, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But ’s only a matter o’ time, i’n’t it, after <PER>Malfoy</PER> ” “How is he?” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they all sat down.
“It wasn’t serious, was it?” “Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> dully, “but he’s sayin’ it’s still agony covered in bandages moanin’ ” “He’s faking it,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
He grabbed both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.
“I think you’ve had enough to drink, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> firmly.
“Ar, maybe <PER>Hermione</PER>’s right,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, letting go of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> heaved himself out of his chair and followed <PER>Hermione</PER> unsteadily outside.
“What’s he done?” said <PER>Harry</PER> nervously as <PER>Hermione</PER> came back in with the empty tankard.
“Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an’ see me, I really — ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> stopped dead, staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d only just realized <PER>Harry</PER> was there.
He swaggered into the dungeon, He's right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle.
But <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> scowled at each other; Professor <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn’t have said “settle down” if they’d walked in late, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’d have given they detention.
But <PER>Malfoy</PER> had always been able to get away with anything in <PER>Snape</PER> ’s classes; <PER>Snape</PER> was head of Slytherin House, and generally favored his own students above all others.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> set up his cauldron right next to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table.
“Sir,” <PER>Malfoy</PER> called, “sir, I’ll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm — ” “<PER>Weasley</PER>, cut up <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s roots for him,” said <PER>Snape</PER> without looking up.
“<PER>Weasley</PER>, you heard Professor <PER>Snape</PER>; cut up these roots.” <PER>Ron</PER> seized his knife, pulled <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s roots toward him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.
“Professor,” drawled <PER>Malfoy</PER>, “<PER>Weasley</PER>’s mutilating my roots, sir.” <PER>Snape</PER> approached their table, stared down <PER>Weasley</PER>’s's hooked nose at the roots, then gave <PER>Ron</PER> an unpleasant smile from beneath <PER>Weasley</PER>’s's long, greasy black hair.
“Change roots with <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Weasley</PER>.” “But, sir — !” <PER>Ron</PER> had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.
<PER>Ron</PER> shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, then took up the knife again.
“Potter, you can skin <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s shrivelfig,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, giving <PER>Harry</PER> the look of loathing <PER>Harry</PER> always reserved just for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s shrivelfig as <PER>Ron</PER> began trying to repair the damage to the roots <PER>Harry</PER> now had to use.
<PER>Harry</PER> skinned <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s shrivelfig as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could and flung the shrivelfig back across the table at <PER>Malfoy</PER> without speaking.
“Father’s not very happy about my injury — ” “Keep talking, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and I’ll give you a real injury,” snarled <PER>Ron</PER>.
“To try to get <PER>Hagrid</PER> fired.” “Well,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, lowering his voice to a whisper, “ partly , Potter.
<PER>Neville</PER> regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was <PER>Neville</PER>'s worst subject, and <PER>Neville</PER>'s great fear of Professor <PER>Snape</PER> made things ten times worse.
Professor <PER>Snape</PER> potion, which was supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned — “Orange, Longbottom,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, ladling some up and allowing it to splash back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see.
“Please, sir,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “please, I could help <PER>Neville</PER> put it right — ” “I don’t remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went as pink as <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow <PER>Harry</PER>’s brass scales, “have you heard?
<PER>Hermione</PER> was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth, so that <PER>Snape</PER> wouldn’t see.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner.
“What did <PER>Malfoy</PER> mean?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle’s mouth.
<PER>Snape</PER> picked up Trevor the toad in <PER>Snape</PER>'s left hand and dipped a small spoon into <PER>Neville</PER>’s potion, which was now green.
<PER>Snape</PER>, looking sour, pulled a small bottle from the pocket of <PER>Snape</PER>'s robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor, and <PER>Snape</PER> reappeared suddenly, fully grown.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still thinking about what <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said, while <PER>Ron</PER> was seething about <PER>Snape</PER>.
“There <PER>Hermione</PER> is,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t surprised; <PER>Harry</PER> could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.
“D’you get the feeling <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s not telling us something?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>Snape</PER> was sitting in a low armchair, and Professor <PER>Snape</PER> looked around as the class filed in.
Professor <PER>Snape</PER> eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s mouth.
<PER>Harry</PER> glared at <PER>Snape</PER>; it was bad enough that <PER>Harry</PER> bullied <PER>Neville</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own classes, let alone doing it in front of other teachers.
“I was hoping that <PER>Neville</PER> would assist me with the first stage of the operation,” he said, “and I am sure he will perform it admirably.” <PER>Neville</PER>’s face went, if possible, even redder.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s lip curled, but <PER>Snape</PER> left, shutting the door with a snap.
“Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know what shape it should be?” “Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and <PER>Hermione</PER> put <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand down, looking a little disappointed.
<PER>Neville</PER> looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor <PER>Snape</PER>.” Nearly everyone laughed.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> hmmm <PER>Neville</PER>, I believe you live with your grandmother?” “Er — yes,” said <PER>Neville</PER> nervously.
“When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, <PER>Neville</PER>, and sees you, it will assume the form of Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,” said Lupin.
<PER>Harry</PER> first thought was Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> — a <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned to full strength.
But before Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart - <PER>Voldemort</PER>, a horrible image came floating to the surface of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s mind.
<PER>Ron</PER> was muttering to himself, “Take its legs off.” <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> knew what that was about.
Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor <PER>Snape</PER> stepped out, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes flashing at <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER> backed away, <PER>Neville</PER>'s wand up, mouthing wordlessly.
<PER>Snape</PER> was bearing down upon <PER>Snape</PER>, reaching inside <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Ron</PER> had frozen.
Then — “RiddikulusV’ bellowed <PER>Ron</PER>, and the spider’s legs vanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of it way and it came to a halt at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet.
“RiddikulusV’ he shouted, and they had a split second’s view of <PER>Snape</PER> in <PER>Snape</PER>'s lacy dress before <PER>Neville</PER> let out a great “Ha!” of laughter, and the boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was gone.
“You and <PER>Hermione</PER> answered my questions correctly at the start of the class, <PER>Harry</PER>,” Lupin said lightly.
Only <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.
<PER>Harry</PER> only wished <PER>Harry</PER> was as happy with some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s other classes.
The story of the boggart assuming <PER>Snape</PER>’s shape, and the way that <PER>Neville</PER> had dressed it in his grandmother’s clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire.
<PER>Snape</PER> eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of Professor Lupin’s name, and <PER>Snape</PER> was bullying <PER>Neville</PER> worse than ever.
<PER>Harry</PER> was also growing to dread the hours <PER>Harry</PER> spent in Professor Trelawney’s stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney’s enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
their had also started using hushed voices whenever their spoke to <PER>Harry</PER>, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were on <PER>Harry</PER>'s deathbed.
At the start of October, however, <PER>Harry</PER> had something else to occupy <PER>Harry</PER>, something so enjoyable it more than made up for <PER>Harry</PER>'s unsatisfactory classes.
“What’s happened?” he asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for Astronomy.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s supposed to stay in school — ” “<PER>Harry</PER> can’t be the only third year left behind,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Ask McGonagall, go on, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “Yeah, I think I will,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making up <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
<PER>Hermione</PER> opened <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lap.
<PER>Harry</PER> really wanted to go to bed, but <PER>Harry</PER> still had <PER>Harry</PER>'s own star chart to complete.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag toward <PER>Harry</PER>, took out parchment, ink, and quill, and started work.
“You can copy mine, if you like,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, don’t hurt him!” squealed <PER>Hermione</PER>; the whole common room was watching; <PER>Ron</PER> whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers came flying out of the top — “CATCH THAT CAT!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the terrified Scabbers.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried over; <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed Crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away; <PER>Ron</PER> threw him onto his stomach and, with great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.
“All cats chase rats, <PER>Ron</PER>!” “There’s something funny about that animal!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket.
“Crookshanks could smell him, <PER>Ron</PER>, how else d’you think — ” “That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, ignoring the people around him, who were starting to giggle.
<PER>Ron</PER> was still in a bad mood with <PER>Hermione</PER> next day.
He barely talked to her all through Herbology, even though he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were working together on the same puffapod.
“What’s the matter, Lavender?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously as she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> went to join the group.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hesitated; then <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “You — you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?” “Well, not necessarily by a fox,” said Lavender, looking up at <PER>Hermione</PER> with streaming eyes, “but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn’t I?” “Oh,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“ — and she can’t have been dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock — ” “Don’t mind <PER>Hermione</PER>, Lavender,” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, “she doesn’t think other people’s pets matter very much.” Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was perhaps lucky; <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were looking daggers at each other, and when <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> got into class, <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> seated <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> on either side of <PER>Harry</PER> and didn’t talk to each other for the whole class.
<PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t decided what <PER>Harry</PER> was going to say to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.
“Go for it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> stubbornly.
<PER>Ron</PER> called Professor McGonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed <PER>Hermione</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> assumed an “all-for-the-best” expression that made <PER>Ron</PER> even angrier, and <PER>Harry</PER> had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade.
“There’s always the feast,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, in an effort to cheer <PER>Harry</PER> up.
<PER>Ron</PER> halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but <PER>Hermione</PER> stamped on that one, reminding <PER>Ron</PER> what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told them about the dementors being able to see through them.
“All right, the sweetshop’s rather good, and Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dangerous, and yes, the Shrieking Shack’s always worth a visit, but really, <PER>Harry</PER>, apart from that, you’re not missing anything.” On Halloween morning, <PER>Harry</PER> awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing <PER>Harry</PER>'s best to act normally.
He and <PER>Hermione</PER> had finally forgotten He and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s squabble about Crookshanks in the face of <PER>Harry</PER>’s difficulties.
“Don’t worry about me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in what <PER>Harry</PER> hoped was an offhand voice, “I’ll see you at the feast.
“Scared of passing the dementors?” <PER>Harry</PER> ignored <PER>Harry</PER> and made <PER>Harry</PER>'s solitary way up the marble staircase, through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.
<PER>Harry</PER> wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there <PER>Harry</PER> changed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind; <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel like working.
But <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t go back to the common room; <PER>Harry</PER> climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said, “<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin, looking around <PER>Harry</PER>'s office door.
“Where are <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Hogsmeade,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, in a would-be casual voice.
“I’ve only got teabags, I’m afraid — but I daresay you’ve had enough of tea leaves?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want Lupin to think <PER>Harry</PER> was a coward, especially since Lupin already seemed to think <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t cope with a boggart.
Something of <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts seemed to have shown on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, because Lupin said, “Anything worrying you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied.
<PER>Harry</PER> drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> said suddenly, putting <PER>Harry</PER>'s tea down on Lupin’s desk.
“Well,” said Lupin, frowning slightly, “I assumed that if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> stared.
The only person <PER>Harry</PER> had ever heard say the name aloud (apart from <PER>Harry</PER>) was Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>'s black eyes narrowing.
It was dusk, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they’d had the time of their lives.
“But if he — you know” — <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped — <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice, glancing nervously around — “if he was trying to — to poison Lupin — he wouldn’t have done it in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Yeah, maybe,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall.
The food was delicious; even <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes along the table, to the place where <PER>Snape</PER> sat.
Was <PER>Snape</PER> imagining it, or were <PER>Snape</PER> ’s eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?
It had been such a pleasant evening that <PER>Harry</PER>’s good mood couldn’t even be spoiled by <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall, “The dementors send their love, Potter!” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students.
<PER>Harry</PER> peered over the heads in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
A moment later, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> through, and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved closer to see what the trouble was.
“Oh, my — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and <PER>Snape</PER> hurrying toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t dare taunt <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Instead <PER>Dumbledore</PER> adopted an oily voice that was no better than <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s cackle.
“Send word with one of the ghosts.” Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> paused, about to leave the hall, and said, “Oh, yes, you’ll be needing ” One casual wave of Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.
“Sleep well,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, closing the door behind Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> obviously thinks he might be,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Honestly, am I the only person who’s ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A History?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> crossly to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
What with that, and the whispering that still filled the hall, <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> were sleeping outdoors in a light wind.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping bags, telling people off for talking.
Percy was only a short way away from <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who quickly pretended to be asleep as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s footsteps drew nearer.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head very slightly off <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms to free his other ear.
“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.” <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s back was to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could see Percy’s face, rapt with attention, and <PER>Snape</PER> ’s profile, which looked angry.
<PER>Snape</PER> stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on <PER>Snape</PER>'s face; then <PER>Snape</PER> too left.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with He, and Percy <PER>Weasley</PER> (acting, <PER>Harry</PER> suspected, on his mother’s orders) was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog.
To cap it all, Professor McGonagall summoned <PER>Harry</PER> into her office, with such a somber expression on her face <PER>Harry</PER> thought someone must have died.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor team’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d suggested <PER>Harry</PER> as Seeker in the first place.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited, holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath.
“There’s nothing wrong with <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s arm!” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no room in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow.
The third time this happened, Oliver Wood talked for so long that <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized <PER>Harry</PER> was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, “Diggory’s got a very fast swerve, <PER>Harry</PER>, so you might want to try looping him — ” <PER>Harry</PER> skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.
“I believe I told you to sit down?” But <PER>Harry</PER> stayed where <PER>Harry</PER> was.
“Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be fifty.” <PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat and sat down.
“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far — ” “Please, sir, we’ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, “and we’re just about to start — ” “Be quiet,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly.
“But, sir,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, seemingly unable to restrain <PER>Hermione</PER>, “we’re not supposed to do werewolves yet, we’re due to start hinkypunks — ” “Miss Granger,” said <PER>Snape</PER> in a voice of deadly calm, “I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you.
“Anyone?” <PER>Snape</PER> said, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.” <PER>Hermione</PER> went very red, put down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand, and stared at the floor with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes full of tears.
It was a mark of how much the class loathed <PER>Snape</PER> that they were all glaring at him, because every one of they had called <PER>Hermione</PER> a know-it-all at least once, and <PER>Ron</PER>, who told <PER>Hermione</PER> she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, “You asked us a question and she knows the answer!
<PER>Snape</PER> advanced on <PER>Ron</PER> slowly, and the room held its breath.
“Detention, <PER>Weasley</PER>,” <PER>Snape</PER> said silkily, his face very close to <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
“<PER>Snape</PER> ’s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“D’you know what that — ” (he called <PER>Snape</PER> something that made <PER>Hermione</PER> say “<PER>Ron</PER>\”) “ — is making me do?
<PER>Harry</PER> fumbled for <PER>Harry</PER>'s alarm clock and looked at his alarm clock.
“You know, I reckon <PER>Ron</PER> was right about you,” <PER>Harry</PER> told Crookshanks suspiciously.
At long last <PER>Harry</PER> thought it must be time for breakfast, so <PER>Harry</PER> headed through the portrait hole alone.
Just before he entered the locker room, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.
<PER>Harry</PER> rose fast, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind.
Within five minutes <PER>Harry</PER> was soaked to <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin and frozen, hardly able to see <PER>Harry</PER>'s teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch.
Twice <PER>Harry</PER> came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; Twice <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses his hadn’t seen them coming.
Twice <PER>Harry</PER> nearly hit another player, without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly tell them apart.
With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch’s whistle; <PER>Harry</PER> could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing <PER>Harry</PER> to the ground.
“Come on, under here — ” They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; <PER>Harry</PER> took off <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and wiped They hurriedly on <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
At that very moment, <PER>Hermione</PER> appeared at his shoulder; <PER>Hermione</PER> was holding <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cloak over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head and was, inexplicably, beaming.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still numb with cold, still wetter than he’d ever been in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, but <PER>Harry</PER> could see.
Full of fresh determination, <PER>Harry</PER> urged <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom through the turbulent air, staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction.
<PER>Harry</PER> needed to get the Snitch quickly — <PER>Harry</PER> turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw something that distracted <PER>Harry</PER> completely — the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s numb hands slipped on the broom handle and <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus dropped a few feet.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, behind you!” <PER>Harry</PER> looked wildly around.
Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them — With a jolt of panic, <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> flat to the broom-handle and zoomed toward the Snitch.
Before he’d had time to think, <PER>Harry</PER> had taken <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes off the Snitch and looked down.
At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at <PER>Harry</PER>, were standing beneath <PER>Harry</PER>.
Someone was screaming, screaming inside Someone's head a woman “Not <PER>Harry</PER>, not <PER>Harry</PER>, please not <PER>Harry</PER>\” “ Stand aside, you silly girl stand aside, now.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have a clue where <PER>Harry</PER> was, or how He’d got there, or what He’d been doing before <PER>Harry</PER> got there.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that every inch of <PER>Harry</PER> was aching as though it had been beaten.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were also there, looking as though they’d just climbed out of a swimming pool.
“We think he’s trying to drown he.” <PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s face to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, his hands gripping his hair.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved nearer to <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was really angry,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said in a quaking voice.
He looked up and saw <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.
“Did someone get my Nimbus?” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked quickly at each other.
“And?” “And it hit — it hit — oh, <PER>Harry</PER> — it hit the Whomping Willow.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides lurched.
Slowly, <PER>Hermione</PER> reached down for a bag at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of <PER>Harry</PER>’s faithful, finally beaten broomstick.
He knew He was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help the Nimbus was beyond repair; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d lost one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s best friends.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and <PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER>, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had made she, which sang shrilly unless <PER>Harry</PER> kept it shut under his bowl of fruit.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedside only at night.
But nothing anyone said or did could make <PER>Harry</PER> feel any better, because they knew only half of what was troubling <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t told anyone about the Grim, not even <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, because he knew <PER>Ron</PER> would panic and <PER>Hermione</PER> would scoff.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt sick and humiliated every time <PER>Harry</PER> thought of them.
<PER>Harry</PER> had heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while <PER>Harry</PER> lay awake, staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling.
When the dementors approached <PER>Harry</PER>, the dementors heard the last moments of the dementors's mother’s life, her attempts to protect him, <PER>Harry</PER>, from Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s laughter before <PER>Voldemort</PER> murdered her .
<PER>Harry</PER> dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s voice.
It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, even if he had to endure <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s taunting.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was almost beside <PER>Malfoy</PER> with glee at Gryffindor’s defeat.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> had finally taken off <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s bandages, and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of <PER>Harry</PER> falling off He's broom.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> spent much of their next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; <PER>Ron</PER> finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, which hit him in the face and caused <PER>Snape</PER> to take fifty points from Gryffindor.
“If <PER>Snape</PER>’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I’m skiving off,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they headed toward Lupin’s classroom after lunch.
“Check who’s in there, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” <PER>Hermione</PER> peered around the classroom door.
It certainly looked as though he had been ill. he old robes were hanging more loosely on he and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about <PER>Snape</PER>’s behavior while Professor Lupin had been ill. “It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?” “us don’t know anything about werewolves — ” “ — two rolls of parchment!” “Did you tell Professor <PER>Snape</PER> us haven’t covered them yet?” Professor Lupin asked, frowning slightly.
When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door, <PER>Harry</PER> among them, but — “Wait a moment, <PER>Harry</PER>,” Lupin called.
“I can hear <PER>Voldemort</PER> murdering my mum.” Lupin made a sudden motion with <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm as though to grip <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, but thought better of it.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though <PER>Ron</PER> said it was because he couldn’t stand two weeks with Percy, and <PER>Hermione</PER> insisted <PER>Hermione</PER> needed to use the library, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t fooled; they were doing it to keep <PER>Harry</PER> company, and <PER>Harry</PER> was very grateful.
“Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!” Resigned to the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> would be the only third year staying behind again, <PER>Harry</PER> borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very slow and jerky; <PER>Harry</PER> definitely needed a new broom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, <PER>Harry</PER> bid good-bye to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the marble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower.
“A bit of old parchment!” said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as though <PER>Harry</PER> had mortally offended <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Explain, George.” “Well when we were in we first year, <PER>Harry</PER> — young, carefree, and innocent — ” <PER>Harry</PER> snorted.
A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was pacing Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s study; the caretaker’s cat, Mistress Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room.
And as <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed something else.
But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something <PER>Harry</PER> had once heard Arthur say came floating out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s memory.
Aids for Magical Mischief-Makers but then, <PER>Harry</PER> reasoned, <PER>Harry</PER> only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn’t as though <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to steal anything or attack anyone and Fred and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening.
<PER>Harry</PER> traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with <PER>Harry</PER>'s finger.
Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, <PER>Harry</PER> rolled up the map, stuffed it inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with <PER>Harry</PER> little ink self's minute wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly took out <PER>Harry</PER>'s real wand and tapped the statue.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted <PER>Harry</PER> into the hole headfirst, and pushed <PER>Harry</PER> forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand out in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
It took ages, but <PER>Harry</PER> had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain <PER>Harry</PER>.
Panting, <PER>Harry</PER> sped up, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face hot, <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet very cold.
Ten minutes later, <PER>Harry</PER> came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which rose out of sight above <PER>Harry</PER>.
A hundred steps, two hundred steps, <PER>Harry</PER> lost count as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed, watching <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood there, massaging the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, listening.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t hear any sounds above <PER>Harry</PER>.
Wondering what <PER>Harry</PER> ought to do, <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> might not get another chance — Quickly and silently, <PER>Harry</PER> dodged out from <PER>Harry</PER>'s hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back, <PER>Harry</PER> saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head, buried in a box.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached the door at the top of the stairs, slipped through the door, and found <PER>Harry</PER> behind the counter of Honeydukes <PER>Harry</PER> ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.
<PER>Harry</PER> squeezed <PER>Harry</PER> through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES).
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored lollipops.
“Ugh, no, <PER>Harry</PER> won’t want one of those, they’re for vampires, I expect,” <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying.
“How about these?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shoving ajar of Cockroach Clusters under <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s nose.
“<PER>Harry</PER>\” squealed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m their brother!” “But <PER>Harry</PER> isn’t going to keep it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as though the idea were ludicrous.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “No, I’m not!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you mad?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, goggling at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh — of course not — but honestly, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel.
“Reckon Fred’d take a bit of Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?” When <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had paid for all their sweets, the three of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside.
<PER>Harry</PER> shivered; unlike the other two, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak.
They headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shouting through their scarves.
“That’s the post office — ” “Zonko’s is up there — ” “We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — ” “Tell you what,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his teeth chattering, “shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?” <PER>Harry</PER> was more than willing; the wind was fierce and <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands were freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s way to the back of the room, where there was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas tree, which stood next to the fireplace.
It was the most delicious thing <PER>Harry</PER>’d ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of <PER>Harry</PER> from the inside.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over the rim of <PER>Harry</PER>'s tankard and choked.
Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak — <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge, Minister of Magic.
In an instant, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had both placed hands on the top of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head and forced him off his stool and under the table.
Dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, <PER>Harry</PER> clutched <PER>Harry</PER>'s empty tankard and watched the teachers’ and Fudge’s feet move toward the bar, pause, then turn and walk right toward him.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw the lower part of Fudge’s thick body twist in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair as though <PER>Harry</PER> were checking for eavesdroppers.
“Fred and George <PER>Weasley</PER> could give ’em a run fer Fred and George <PER>Weasley</PER>'s money.” “You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!” chimed in Professor Flitwick.
“James Potter told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself and yet, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> remained worried.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s faces appeared under the table.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have a very clear idea of how <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to get back into the Honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle once more.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, Arthur, <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge why hadn’t anyone ever mentioned the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>’s parents had died because their best friend had betrayed their?
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> nervously all through dinner, not daring to talk about what they’d overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them.
Their best man <PER>Harry</PER> had never given Their best man <PER>Harry</PER> a thought before.
Did <PER>Harry</PER> realize <PER>Harry</PER> was facing twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make <PER>Harry</PER> unrecognizable?
But the dementors don’t affect <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, staring into the handsome, laughing face.
<PER>Harry</PER> doesn’t have to hear my mum screaming if they get too close — <PER>Harry</PER> slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into — <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabinet, took off — <PER>Harry</PER>'s robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings were hiding him from view.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice uncertainly.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> leave again, and rolled over on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes wide open.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you — you look terrible.” <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t gotten to sleep until daybreak.
<PER>Harry</PER> had awoken to find the dormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for <PER>Ron</PER>, who was eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had spread her homework over three tables.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, listen,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, exchanging a look with <PER>Ron</PER>, “you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while <PER>Harry</PER> had been asleep.
“You won’t, will you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“D’you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> shook their heads, looking apprehensive.
“<PER>Harry</PER> doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” Again, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t answer.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know what <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to do.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more than <PER>Harry</PER> could stand.
“He was right in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s inner circle — ” “ Say You-Knotu-Who, will you?” interjected <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
“ — so obviously, the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s knew Black was working for <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “ — and <PER>Malfoy</PER>’d love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like Pettigrew!
“<PER>Harry</PER> isn’t supposed to leave the castle, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “Yeah, let’s go,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting up, “and I can ask <PER>Harry</PER> how come <PER>Harry</PER> never mentioned Black when <PER>Harry</PER> told me all about my parents!” Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn’t what <PER>Ron</PER> had had in mind.
“Listen — is that Fang?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> put their ears to the door too.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” called <PER>Harry</PER>, thumping the door.
<PER>Harry</PER>, about to collapse under <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s weight, was rescued by <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who each seized <PER>Hagrid</PER> under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what is it?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, aghast.
“What’s this, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s sobs redoubled, but <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s shoved the letter toward <PER>Harry</PER>, who picked it up and read aloud: Dear Mister <PER>Hagrid</PER>, Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class, our have accepted the assurances of Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.
“Well, that’s okay then, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, clapping <PER>Hagrid</PER> on the shoulder.
But <PER>Hagrid</PER> continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting <PER>Harry</PER> to read on.
We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mister <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.
“They’ve got it in fer interestin’ creatures!” A sudden sound from the corner of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin made <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> whip around.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sitting down and laying a hand on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s massive forearm.
“Them Disposal devils, Them Disposal’re all in <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s pocket!
“What about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Got enough on his plate what with keepin’ them dementors outta the castle, an’ Sirius Black lurkin’ around — ” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked quickly at <PER>Harry</PER>, as though expecting him to start berating <PER>Hagrid</PER> for not telling him the truth about Black.
But <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t bring <PER>Harry</PER> to do it, not now that <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> so miserable and scared.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER> to help them.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched him breathlessly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had never heard <PER>Hagrid</PER> talk about his brief spell in Azkaban before.
After a pause, <PER>Hermione</PER> said timidly, “Is it awful in there, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “Yeh’ve no idea,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> quietly.
“I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.” The trip to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the effect <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had hoped.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> had by no means forgotten about Black, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t brood constantly on revenge if <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to help <PER>Hagrid</PER> win his case against the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak.
On Christmas morning, <PER>Harry</PER> was woken by <PER>Ron</PER> throwing <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillow at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Dunno ” <PER>Harry</PER> ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedspread.
“ Who — ?” “I know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, controlling himself, “I know who it could’ve been — Lupin!” “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, now starting to laugh himself.
“I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from <PER>Snape</PER>, remember?” <PER>Harry</PER> frowned at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I can’t see Lupin affording something like this.” “What ’re you two laughing about?” <PER>Hermione</PER> had just come in, wearing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>\ Who sent you that?” “No idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
On the contrary, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face fell, and <PER>Hermione</PER> bit <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip.
“Well who’d send <PER>Harry</PER> something as expensive as that, and not even tell <PER>Harry</PER> they’d sent it?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at her.
“What d’you think <PER>Harry</PER>’s going to do with it — sweep the floor?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
But before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus’s bed, right at <PER>Ron</PER>’s chest.
<PER>Ron</PER> seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed, knocking it over and causing <PER>Ron</PER> to hop up and down, howling with pain.
“You’d better take that cat out of here, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> furiously, sitting on <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed nursing <PER>Harry</PER>'s toe.
“Can’t you shut that thing up?” he added to <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Hermione</PER> strode out of the room, Crookshanks ’s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on <PER>Ron</PER>.
It had been a while since <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER> out of <PER>Ron</PER>’s pocket, and <PER>Harry</PER> was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too.
And despite <PER>Ron</PER>’s frequent complaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure <PER>Ron</PER> would be very miserable if Scabbers died.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had shut Crookshanks in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s dormitory, but was furious with <PER>Ron</PER> for trying to kick him; <PER>Ron</PER> was still fuming about Crookshanks ’s fresh attempt to eat Scabbers.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted <PER>Harry</PER> to examining the Firebolt, which <PER>Harry</PER> had brought down to the common room with <PER>Harry</PER>.
For some reason this seemed to annoy <PER>Hermione</PER> as well; <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t say anything, but <PER>Hermione</PER> kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cat.
Professors <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, McGonagall, <PER>Snape</PER>, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat.
“Merry Christmas!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> approached the table.
“Crackers!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> enthusiastically, offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to <PER>Snape</PER>, who took it reluctantly and tugged.
<PER>Harry</PER>, remembering the boggart, caught <PER>Ron</PER>’s eye and they both grinned; <PER>Snape</PER> ’s mouth thinned and <PER>Snape</PER> pushed the hat toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who swapped it for <PER>Snape</PER>'s wizard’s hat at once.
As <PER>Harry</PER> was helping <PER>Harry</PER> to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great Hall opened again.
Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still wearing their party hats, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly.
“Coming?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“No,” <PER>Hermione</PER> muttered, “I want a quick word with Professor McGonagall.” “Probably trying to see if she can take any more classes,” yawned <PER>Ron</PER> as they made their way into the entrance hall, which was completely devoid of mad axe-men.
<PER>Harry</PER> went straight up to the dormitory, collected the Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> for <PER>Harry</PER>'s birthday, brought them downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and <PER>Hermione</PER> came in, accompanied by Professor McGonagall.
<PER>Hermione</PER> walked around them, sat down, picked up the nearest book, and hid <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face behind it.
“Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked around at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Well, I’m afraid I will have to take this, Potter.” “W — what?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, scrambling to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.” “There’s nothing wrong with it!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice shaking slightly.
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, rounded on <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced <PER>Ron</PER> defiantly.
“Because I thought — and Professor McGonagall agrees with me — that that broom was probably sent to <PER>Harry</PER> by Sirius Black!” <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hermione</PER> had meant well, but that didn’t stop <PER>Harry</PER> from being angry with <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know whether <PER>Harry</PER> would ever see it again.
<PER>Ron</PER> was furious with <PER>Hermione</PER> too.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didn’t try to persuade shis to come back.
The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had the shortest life line she had ever seen.
It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that <PER>Harry</PER> was keen to get to; after <PER>Harry</PER>'s conversation with Wood, <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to get started on <PER>Harry</PER>'s anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible.
“Ah yes,” said Lupin, when <PER>Harry</PER> reminded him of <PER>Harry</PER>'s promise at the end of class.
“Fine,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> haughtily, and <PER>Hermione</PER> marched off.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> doesn’t know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, staring resentfully after <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>’s just trying to get us to talk to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s again.” At eight o’clock on Thursday evening, <PER>Harry</PER> left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom.
It was dark and empty when <PER>Harry</PER> arrived, but <PER>Harry</PER> lit the lamps with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and had waited only five minutes when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which Professor Lupin heaved onto Professor Binns’ desk.
“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin, “which is a kind of anti- dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.” <PER>Harry</PER> had a sudden vision of <PER>Harry</PER> crouching behind a <PER>Hagrid</PER>-sized figure holding a large club.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.” “And how do you conjure it?” “With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.” <PER>Harry</PER> cast <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind about for a happy memory.
“Expecto patronum).” “Expecto patronum,” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated under his breath, “expecto patronum.” “Concentrating hard on your happy memory?” “Oh — yeah — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, quickly forcing <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts back to that first broom ride.
“Right, then — ready to try it on a dementor?” “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, gripping <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind on flying, but something else kept intruding .
Any second now, <PER>Harry</PER> might hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother again but <PER>Harry</PER> shouldn’t think that, or <PER>Harry</PER> would hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother's again, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to or did <PER>Harry</PER>?
A wave of piercing cold broke over <PER>Harry</PER> — “Expecto patronurrd” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
<PER>Harry</PER> was falling again through thick white fog, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s voice was louder than ever, echoing inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s head — “ Not <PER>Harry</PER>\ Not <PER>Harry</PER>\ Please — I’ll do anything — ” “Stand aside.
<PER>Harry</PER> was lying flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on the floor.
“Yes ” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> up on one of the desks and leaned against it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than understand — ” “I do!” said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely, stuffing the rest of the <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog into <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
“Ready,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying hard to fill <PER>Harry</PER>'s head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened.
The dementor glided forward, drawing The dementor breath; one rotting hand was extending toward <PER>Harry</PER> — “Expecto patronum).” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
This time it was a minute before <PER>Harry</PER> understood why <PER>Harry</PER> was lying on a dusty classroom floor.
Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he’d realized he’d be leaving Privet Drive, <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and faced the packing case once more.
“ EXPECTO PATRONUM EXPECTO PATRONUM ” The screaming inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head had started again — except this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and louder and softer again — and he could still see the dementor — it had halted — and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, to hover between <PER>Harry</PER> and the dementor, and though <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs felt like water, <PER>Harry</PER> was still on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet — though for how much longer, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure — “ RiddikulusV’ roared Lupin, springing forward.
Then <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts wandered back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother and father.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt drained and strangely empty, even though <PER>Harry</PER> was so full of chocolate.
Terrible though it was to hear his parents’ last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times <PER>Harry</PER> had heard these's voices since <PER>Harry</PER> was a very small child.
This meant that with Lupin’s anti- dementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, <PER>Harry</PER> had just one night a week to do all <PER>Harry</PER>'s homework.
Even so, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t showing the strain nearly as much as <PER>Hermione</PER>, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her.
Every night, without fail, <PER>Hermione</PER> was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; <PER>Hermione</PER> barely spoke to anybody and snapped when <PER>Hermione</PER> was interrupted.
“How’s <PER>Hermione</PER> doing it?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> one evening as <PER>Harry</PER> sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, <PER>Ron</PER> standing hopefully at his shoulder, <PER>Hermione</PER> rushing past with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face averted.
All it did was hover, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining <PER>Harry</PER> of energy as <PER>Harry</PER> fought to keep it there.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt angry with <PER>Harry</PER>, guilty about <PER>Harry</PER>'s secret desire to hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ voices again.
“Oh — <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> brought me some back from Hogsmeade,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied quickly.
<PER>Harry</PER> half wished that <PER>Harry</PER> half hadn’t asked what was under a dementor’s hood, the answer had been so horrible, and <PER>Harry</PER> half was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that <PER>Harry</PER> half walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.
“She’s in the common room now — working, for a change — ” They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom entrance.
Then, spotting <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>: “Good even, my fine young yeomen!
“I made <PER>Neville</PER> tell me what passwords <PER>Neville</PER> was going to use this week, because <PER>Neville</PER> keeps changing what passwords, and now I don’t know what I’ve done with what passwords!” “Oddsbodikins,” said <PER>Harry</PER> to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room.
There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was surrounded by people exclaiming over <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt.
“Where ’d you get it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Will you let me have a go?” “Have you ridden it yet, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Ravenclaw’ll have no chance, they’re all on Cleansweep Sevens!” “Can I just hold it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had a clear view of <PER>Hermione</PER>, the only person who hadn’t rushed over to them, bent over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s work and carefully avoiding them's eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> approached her table and at last, she looked up.
“Can I sit down, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (“Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity”) and at the rune translation <PER>Hermione</PER> was now poring over.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the sheet <PER>Ron</PER> was holding.
<PER>Ron</PER> threw something down onto <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s rune translation.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward.
It looked like the end of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s friendship.
<PER>Ron</PER> was enraged that <PER>Hermione</PER> had never taken Crookshanks’s attempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn’t bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that <PER>Ron</PER> look for Scabbers under all the boys’ beds.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that <PER>Ron</PER> had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that <PER>Ron</PER> had been prejudiced against <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on <PER>Ron</PER>’s head in the Magical Menagerie.
Personally, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when <PER>Harry</PER> tried to point out to <PER>Hermione</PER> that the evidence all pointed that way, <PER>Hermione</PER> lost <PER>Hermione</PER>'s temper with <PER>Harry</PER> too.
“Remember, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yeah, that’s true,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’ll sit over here with <PER>Weasley</PER> ” She and <PER>Ron</PER> left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow’s match.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; <PER>Harry</PER> outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute’s head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; <PER>Harry</PER> spotted it lurking near Katie Bell’s knee, looped Katie Bell’s's easily, and caught it again.
“Not unless — <PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve sorted out your dementor problem, haven’t you?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking of <PER>Harry</PER>'s feeble Patronus and wishing it were stronger.
“Here you go,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, handing <PER>Ron</PER> the Firebolt.
<PER>Ron</PER>, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while <PER>Harry</PER> walked around the edge of the field, watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> off for not waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle.
<PER>Harry</PER> shouldered the Firebolt and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt’s superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning.
They were halfway toward the castle when <PER>Harry</PER>, glancing to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left, saw something that made <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart turn over — a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped dead, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart banging against <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs.
Slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t say anything to <PER>Ron</PER> — nor did <PER>Ron</PER> — look left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor.
“Did you see his face?” said <PER>Ron</PER> gleefully, looking back at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Goyle right behind him.
“Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s pale eyes narrowed, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> stalked away.
They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put They's heads together, no doubt asking <PER>Malfoy</PER> whether <PER>Harry</PER>’s broom really was a Firebolt.
<PER>Harry</PER> took off <PER>Harry</PER>'s black school robes, removed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes.
She was shorter than <PER>Harry</PER> by about a head, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help noticing, nervous as <PER>Harry</PER> was, that She was extremely pretty.
She smiled at <PER>Harry</PER> as the teams faced each other behind the teams's captains, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt a slight lurch in the region of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach that <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t think had anything to do with nerves.
“Mount your brooms on my whistle three — two — one — ” <PER>Harry</PER> kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; <PER>Harry</PER> soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the <PER>Weasley</PER> twins’ friend Lee Jordan.
“Right you are, Professor — just giving a bit of background information — the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and — ” “Jordan!” “Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor heading for goal ” <PER>Harry</PER> streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that <PER>Cho</PER> Chang was tailing him closely.
<PER>Harry</PER> urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and <PER>Cho</PER> fell behind.
<PER>Harry</PER> dived; <PER>Cho</PER> saw what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing and tore after <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were <PER>Harry</PER>'s speciality, <PER>Harry</PER> was ten feet away — Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of nowhere; <PER>Harry</PER> veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.
George <PER>Weasley</PER> vented George <PER>Weasley</PER>'s feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically — a glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings — the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post — <PER>Harry</PER> accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead — but just then, <PER>Cho</PER> appeared out of thin air, blocking <PER>Cho</PER> — “<PER>Harry</PER>, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!” Wood roared as <PER>Harry</PER> swerved to avoid a collision.
“KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!” <PER>Harry</PER> turned and caught sight of <PER>Cho</PER>; <PER>Cho</PER> was grinning.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game.
him dived again, and <PER>Cho</PER>, thinking He’d seen the Snitch, tried to follow; <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; <PER>Harry</PER> rose fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time — the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.
Plunging a hand down the neck of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, <PER>Harry</PER> whipped out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and roared, “Expecto patronum).” Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on <PER>Harry</PER>; next moment, the whole team was hugging <PER>Harry</PER> so hard <PER>Harry</PER> was nearly pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all kissed <PER>Harry</PER>; Fred had <PER>Harry</PER> in a grip so tight <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s head would come off.
<PER>Harry</PER> got off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom and looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, <PER>Ron</PER> in the lead.
“Yes!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, yanking <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm into the air.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who had fought his way through to <PER>Harry</PER>’s side, doubled up with laughter as they watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> fighting to extricate himself from the robe, Goyle’s head still stuck inside it.
<PER>Harry</PER> broke away from the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And I’m very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.” “Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>, come and have some food,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking over at <PER>Ron</PER> and wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.
“Can’t you give shis a break?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match.
At last, exhausted, <PER>Harry</PER> climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep.
<PER>Harry</PER> broke into a run, and ahead <PER>Harry</PER> heard hooves gathering speed.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> was running flat out, and ahead <PER>Harry</PER> could hear galloping.
Disoriented in the total darkness, <PER>Harry</PER> fumbled with his hangings — <PER>Harry</PER> could hear movements around <PER>Harry</PER>, and Seamus Finnigan’s voice from the other side of the room: “What’s going on?” <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard the dormitory door slam.
At last finding the divide in <PER>Harry</PER>'s curtains, <PER>Harry</PER> ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit Dean Thomas's lamp.
“Don’t be ridiculous, <PER>Weasley</PER>, how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole?” “Ask he!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir Cadogan’s picture.
<PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy-slippered toes, raised <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom's hand slowly into the air.
It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they — and now <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> — were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it.
“D’you reckon we should tell someone?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“We know he’s not coming in through Honey duke’s,” said <PER>Ron</PER> dismissively “We’d’ve heard if the shop had been broken into.” <PER>Harry</PER> was glad <PER>Ron</PER> took this view.
For the first time in his life, people were paying more attention to his than to <PER>Harry</PER>, and it was clear that <PER>Ron</PER> was rather enjoying the experience.
“Why, though?” <PER>Ron</PER> added to <PER>Harry</PER> as the group of second-year girls who had been listening to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chilling tale departed.
Why had Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced <PER>Ron</PER> and proceeded to <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who were sitting opposite him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once — <PER>Ron</PER> had got one from — <PER>Ron</PER>'s mother the year before.
“Run for it, <PER>Neville</PER>,” — <PER>Ron</PER> advised.
<PER>Neville</PER> seized the envelope, and holding the envelope before <PER>Neville</PER> like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of He.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too busy feeling sorry for <PER>Neville</PER> to notice immediately that <PER>Harry</PER> had a letter too.
The note inside said: Dear <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, How about having tea with me this afternoon ’round six?
WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN Cheers, <PER>Hagrid</PER> “He probably wants to hear all about Black!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
So at six o’clock that afternoon, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> left Gryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance hall.
“All right, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
The first thing they saw on entering <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets.
Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, <PER>Harry</PER> saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s wardrobe door.
“What are they for, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns, but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cooking.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“I’m not blamin’ yeh!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, waving <PER>Harry</PER>’s apology aside.
<PER>Harry</PER> started and looked around at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, if you go into Hogsmeade again I’ll tell Professor McGonagall about that map!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Can you hear someone talking, <PER>Harry</PER>?” growled <PER>Ron</PER>, not looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Haven’t you done enough damage this year?” <PER>Hermione</PER> opened <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap.
<PER>Hermione</PER> took one frightened look at the expression on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the girls’ dormitories.
“So how about it?” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER> as though there had been no interruption.
“But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.” On Saturday morning, <PER>Harry</PER> packed <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder’s Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone else.
<PER>Hermione</PER> kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him, but him avoided <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eye and was careful to let <PER>Hermione</PER>'s see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors.
“ ’Bye!” <PER>Harry</PER> called to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder’s Map out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket as <PER>Harry</PER> went.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, muttered, “ Dissendium).” and shoved <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag into the statue, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could climb in <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER> came around the corner.
<PER>Neville</PER> took a quick step behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“An odd place to meet — ” To <PER>Harry</PER>’s immense disquiet, <PER>Snape</PER>’s black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.
<PER>Snape</PER> was running one of <PER>Snape</PER>'s hands over the one-eyed witch’s head, examining it closely.
<PER>Harry</PER> managed to shake <PER>Neville</PER> off at the Fat Lady by telling <PER>Harry</PER> the password, then pretending <PER>Harry</PER>’d left <PER>Harry</PER>'s vampire essay in the library and doubling back.
<PER>Harry</PER> scanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus <PER>Snape</PER> was now back in its office.
<PER>Harry</PER> sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved <PER>Harry</PER> inside, and slid down to meet <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag at the bottom of the stone chute.
<PER>Harry</PER>, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded <PER>Ron</PER> in the back.
“Where are you?” <PER>Ron</PER> kept muttering out of the corner of <PER>Snape</PER>'s mouth.
There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s wildest dreams; <PER>Harry</PER> gave <PER>Ron</PER> whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak.
“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend he There’s no ’arm in ’im, ’onest — ’ that hippogriff’s as good as dead — ” <PER>Malfoy</PER> suddenly caught sight of <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What are you doing, <PER>Weasley</PER>?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked up at the crumbling house behind <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> crept silently around behind <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path.
“We were just discussing your friend <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Malfoy</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly around, <PER>Malfoy</PER> trying to wipe his hair clean.
“It came from over there!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, wiping <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s face, and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of <PER>Harry</PER>.
As <PER>Ron</PER> was the only person Crabbe could see, it was <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> started toward, but <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> stuck out <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg.
Crabbe stumbled — and Crabbe's huge, flat foot caught the hem of <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a great tug, then cloak slid off <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
For a split second, <PER>Malfoy</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where <PER>Harry</PER> had disappeared, “you’d better run for it!
<PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach turned over — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would know exactly what had happened, if <PER>Malfoy</PER> said anything — Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone floor, through the trapdoor — <PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the cloak, tucked the cloak under — <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> would get back first how long would it take <PER>Malfoy</PER> to find a teacher?
Panting, a sharp pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s side, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t slow down until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the stone slide.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was too much of a giveaway in case <PER>Malfoy</PER> had tipped off a teacher <PER>Harry</PER> hid it in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could, <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached the inside of the witch’s hump, tapped it with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, stuck <PER>Harry</PER>'s head through, and hoisted <PER>Harry</PER> out; the hump closed, and just as <PER>Harry</PER> jumped out from behind the statue, <PER>Harry</PER> heard quick footsteps approaching.
He approached <PER>Harry</PER> at a swift walk, <PER>Harry</PER>'s black robes swishing, then stopped in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to look innocent, all too aware of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweaty face and <PER>Harry</PER>'s muddy hands, which <PER>Harry</PER> quickly hid in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pockets.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed him downstairs, trying to wipe <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands clean on the inside of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes without <PER>Snape</PER> noticing.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been in here only once before, and <PER>Harry</PER> had been in very serious trouble then too.
<PER>Snape</PER> had acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind <PER>Snape</PER>'s desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.
“Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> tells me that <PER>Harry</PER> was up by the Shrieking Shack when <PER>Harry</PER> ran into <PER>Weasley</PER> — apparently alone.” Still, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t speak.
“Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> states that Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing talking to <PER>Weasley</PER>, when a large amount of mud hit Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the back of the head.
“I don’t know, Professor.” <PER>Snape</PER>’s eyes were boring into <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
“It sounds like <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s having hallucin — ” <PER>Malfoy</PER> is not having hallucinations,” snarled <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> bent down, a hand on each arm of <PER>Harry</PER>’s chair, so that their faces were a foot apart.
<PER>Snape</PER> was trying to provoke <PER>Snape</PER> into telling the truth.
“How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,” <PER>Snape</PER> said suddenly, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes glinting.
“And neither do I.” “Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,” <PER>Snape</PER> went on, pressing <PER>Snape</PER>'s advantage, <PER>Snape</PER>'s thin face full of malice.
“Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter’s delicate ears?” <PER>Harry</PER> bit <PER>Harry</PER>'s lip.
“<PER>Ron</PER> gave them to me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, praying <PER>Harry</PER>’d get a chance to tip <PER>Ron</PER> off before <PER>Snape</PER> saw him.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s face impassive.
<PER>Snape</PER> turned it over, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> clenched <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands to stop them from shaking.
“Professor Severus <PER>Snape</PER>, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!” <PER>Snape</PER> said, hitting the map with <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand.
“Mister Moony presents his compliments to Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people’s business.” <PER>Snape</PER> froze.
“Mister Padfoot would like to register Mister Padfoot's astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.” <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes in horror.
“Mister Wormtail bids Professor <PER>Snape</PER> good day, and advises him to wash him's hair, the slimeball.” <PER>Harry</PER> waited for the blow to fall.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, do you know any of these men?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay — excuse us, Severus — ” <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t dare look at <PER>Snape</PER> as they left <PER>Snape</PER>'s office.
As <PER>Harry</PER> passed the one-eyed witch, he and <PER>Ron</PER> remembered the Invisibility Cloak — it was still down there, but he and <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Ron</PER> didn’t dare go and get it.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was holding a letter in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip was trembling.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> “They can’t do this,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, I’m really, really sorry about Scabbers ,” <PER>Hermione</PER> sobbed.
“S’no good, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> sadly as they reached the castle steps.
“That Committee’s in <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s pocket.
“And he’s supposed to be our teacher!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both made furious moves toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> got there first — SMACK!
<PER>Hermione</PER> had slapped <PER>Malfoy</PER> across the face with all the strength <PER>Hermione</PER> could muster.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as <PER>Hermione</PER> raised her hand again.
“Don’t you dare call <PER>Hagrid</PER> pathetic, you foul — you evil — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> weakly, and “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” tried to grab her hand as her swung her hand back.
“Get off, <PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>l” <PER>Ron</PER> said again, sounding both stunned and impressed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’d better beat <PER>Harry</PER> in the Quidditch final!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said shrilly.
“You just better had, because I can’t stand it if Slytherin wins!” “We’re due in Charms,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, still goggling at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Come along, quickly, wands out, we’re experimenting with Cheering Charms today, we’ve already divided into pairs — ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags.
“Where’s <PER>Hermione</PER> gone?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around too.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t entered the classroom, yet <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Hermione</PER> had been right next to <PER>Harry</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> had opened the door.
“That’s weird,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> could’ve done with a Cheering Charm on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s too,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly — the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment.
By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had started to get slightly worried.
“You don’t think <PER>Malfoy</PER> did something to <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting at a table, fast asleep, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head resting on an open Arithmancy book.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down together at the same rickety table.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> choked back laughs.
<PER>Harry</PER>, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind empty when thoughts such as “this is stupid” kept drifting across this.
It didn’t help that <PER>Ron</PER> kept breaking into silent giggles and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept tutting.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart sinking.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was coming — “There is something here!” Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering Professor Trelawney's face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in Professor Trelawney's huge glasses.
“Something moving but what is it?” <PER>Harry</PER> was prepared to bet everything <PER>Harry</PER> owned, including <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt, that it wasn’t good news, whatever it was.
Then — “Fine!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag.
“Fine!” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated, swinging the bag over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoulder and almost knocking <PER>Ron</PER> off his chair.
Professor Trelawney turned abruptly from <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s table, breathing rather heavily as Professor Trelawney tugged Professor Trelawney's gauzy shawl more closely to Professor Trelawney.
“Some day <PER>Hermione</PER>’s having, eh?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, looking awed.
<PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom wasn’t the only one.
<PER>Harry</PER>, meanwhile, had to fit in <PER>Harry</PER>'s homework around Quidditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood.
Gryffindor hadn’t won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie <PER>Weasley</PER> (<PER>Ron</PER>’s second oldest brother) had been Seeker.
But <PER>Harry</PER> doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as <PER>Harry</PER> did.
The enmity between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> was at its highest point ever.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that <PER>Harry</PER> had somehow wormed <PER>Harry</PER>'s way out of punishment.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t forgotten <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s attempt to sabotage <PER>Harry</PER> in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made <PER>Harry</PER> most determined to beat <PER>Malfoy</PER> in front of the entire school.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip <PER>Harry</PER> up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went, and slouching away looking disappointed when Crabbe and Goyle saw <PER>Harry</PER> surrounded by people.
Wood had given instructions that <PER>Harry</PER> should be accompanied everywhere <PER>Harry</PER> went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action.
The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for <PER>Harry</PER> to get to classes on time because <PER>Harry</PER> was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd.
<PER>Harry</PER> was more concerned for <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt’s safety than <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
When <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t flying it, <PER>Harry</PER> locked it securely in <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still there.
Even <PER>Hermione</PER> had put down Even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s books.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time <PER>Harry</PER> did, <PER>Harry</PER> had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
“You’re going to be fine,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> looked positively terrified.
It was a few seconds before <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that the match hadn’t taken place yet, that <PER>Harry</PER> was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn’t be allowed to play on dragons.
Quietly as <PER>Harry</PER> could, <PER>Harry</PER> got out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s four- poster and went to pour he some water from the silver jug beneath the window.
<PER>Harry</PER> set down <PER>Harry</PER>'s goblet and was about to turn back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed when something caught <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye.
<PER>Harry</PER> dashed to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, snatched up <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window.
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched the window ledge in relief as <PER>Harry</PER> recognized the bottlebrush tail.
<PER>Harry</PER> squinted, pressing <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose flat against the glass.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help grinning broadly as <PER>Harry</PER> saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding them too.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked even paler than usual.
“Good luck, <PER>Harry</PER>!” called <PER>Cho</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> blushing.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered if they were feeling like <PER>Harry</PER> was: as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast.
“Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, <PER>Weasley</PER>, <PER>Weasley</PER>, and Wood.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair fly back off <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead; his nerves left his in the thrill of the flight; his glanced around, saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.
He had seen the Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts — but He mustn’t catch it yet — and if <PER>Malfoy</PER> saw it — Faking a look of sudden concentration, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end — it worked.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> went haring after <PER>Harry</PER>, clearly thinking <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the Snitch there.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward <PER>Harry</PER>, clubs raised — <PER>Harry</PER> turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was still keeping close to <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> soared over the match, looking around for it — once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead — Katie scored.
Moments later, Fred <PER>Weasley</PER> pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle out of Fred <PER>Weasley</PER>'s hands; Alicia seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal — seventy-ten.
<PER>Harry</PER> could almost feel hundreds of eyes following <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with <PER>Malfoy</PER> speeding along behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears; <PER>Harry</PER> stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down — Horrified, he looked around.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> had thrown <PER>Malfoy</PER> forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt’s tail, and was pulling it back.
“You — ” <PER>Harry</PER> was angry enough to hit <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but couldn’t reach — <PER>Malfoy</PER> was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes were sparkling maliciously.
The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s foul on <PER>Harry</PER>, were being spurred on to greater heights.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t going to let <PER>Malfoy</PER> anywhere near the Snitch.
“Get out of it, Potter!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found <PER>Harry</PER> blocking him.
Every single Slytherin player apart from <PER>Malfoy</PER> was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — <PER>Harry</PER> wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low <PER>Harry</PER> was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was diving, a look of triumph on his face — there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer — <PER>Harry</PER> urged the Firebolt downward, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> was miles ahead — “Go!
He was gaining on <PER>Malfoy</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> flattened He to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at He — He was at <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s ankles — He was level — <PER>Harry</PER> threw — <PER>Harry</PER> forward, took both hands off — <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
<PER>Harry</PER> soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; him seized <PER>Harry</PER> around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on <PER>Harry</PER>.
Thrust into the light, he saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>, plastered with crimson rosettes — “Yeh beat ’em, <PER>Harry</PER>, Yeh beat ’em!
Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping Professor McGonagall's eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way toward <PER>Harry</PER>, were <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
them simply beamed as <PER>Harry</PER> was borne toward the stands, where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.
As a sobbing Wood passed <PER>Harry</PER> the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> could have produced the world’s best Patronus.
Even Fred and George <PER>Weasley</PER> had been spotted working; Even Fred and George <PER>Weasley</PER> were about to take Even Fred and George <PER>Weasley</PER>'s O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels).
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had given up asking her how her was managing to attend several classes at once, but they couldn’t restrain they when they saw the exam schedule her had drawn up for her.
The first column read: Monday 9 o’clock, Arithmancy 9 o’clock, Transfiguration Lunch 1 o’clock, Charms 1 o’clock, Ancient Runes “<PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days.
<PER>Hermione</PER> started shifting heaps of parchment around on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s table, looking for the book.
“It’s from <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ripping the note open.
“I’ve spent ages reading up on stuff for him; they can’t just ignore it all!” But <PER>Harry</PER> had a horrible feeling that the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had had its mind made up for it by Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
From sneering comments <PER>Harry</PER> overheard, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was certain Buckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed thoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about.
It was all <PER>Harry</PER> could do to stop <PER>Harry</PER> imitating <PER>Hermione</PER> and hitting <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the face on these occasions.
And the worst thing of all was that they had no time or opportunity to go and see <PER>Hagrid</PER>, because the strict new security measures had not been lifted, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t dare retrieve <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak from below the one-eyed witch.
<PER>Hermione</PER> irritated the rest by fussing about how <PER>Hermione</PER>'s tortoise had looked more like a turtle, which was the least of everyone else’s worries.
<PER>Harry</PER> slightly overdid <PER>Harry</PER>'s out of nerves and <PER>Ron</PER>, who was partnering him, ended up in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to perform the charm himself.
As flobberworms flourished best if left to their own devices, it was the easiest exam any of them had ever taken, and also gave <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> plenty of opportunity to speak to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> told them, bending low on the pretense of checking that <PER>Harry</PER>’s flobberworm was still alive.
Try as <PER>Harry</PER> might, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t get <PER>Harry</PER>'s Confusing Concoction to thicken, and <PER>Snape</PER>, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away.
Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which <PER>Harry</PER> scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told <PER>Harry</PER> about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing <PER>Harry</PER> could have had one of Fortescue ’s choco- nut sundaes with <PER>Harry</PER> in the stifling classroom.
“Excellent, <PER>Harry</PER>,” Lupin muttered as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed out of the trunk, grinning.
“Full marks.” Flushed with his success, <PER>Harry</PER> hung around to watch <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> did everything perfectly until <PER>Hermione</PER> reached the trunk with the boggart in it.
“Sh — <PER>Hermione</PER> said I’d failed everything!” It took a little while to calm — <PER>Hermione</PER> down.
When at last — <PER>Hermione</PER> had regained a grip on — <PER>Hermione</PER>, — <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> went back to the castle.
<PER>Ron</PER> was still slightly inclined to laugh at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.
<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge, sweating slightly in <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge's pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.
<PER>Harry</PER> gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard squinted toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin and said in a feeble voice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this.
<PER>Ron</PER> opened his mouth to say something, but <PER>Hermione</PER> nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head toward the entrance hall.
All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate people's lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, lost in worry about <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Buckbeak, didn’t join in.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s last exam was Divination; <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, Muggle Studies.
They walked up the marble staircase together; <PER>Hermione</PER> left They on the first floor and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> proceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney’s classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute studying.
“she says the crystal ball’s told shis that if I tell you, I’ll have a horrible accident!” squeaked <PER>Neville</PER> as he clambered back down the ladder toward <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had now reached the landing.
“You know, I’m starting to think <PER>Hermione</PER> was right about <PER>Hermione</PER>” — he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead — “<PER>Hermione</PER>’s a right old fraud.” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own watch.
“She says I’ve got all the makings of a true Seer,” She informed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>ald <PER>Weasley</PER>,” said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads.
<PER>Ron</PER> grimaced at <PER>Harry</PER> and climbed the silver ladder out of sight.
<PER>Harry</PER> settled <PER>Harry</PER> on the floor with <PER>Harry</PER>'s back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind across the grounds with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Think, now ” <PER>Harry</PER> cast <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.
Over in the corner, however, sat <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s just sent this.” <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as his wrote that it was hardly legible.
I don’t want you to see it <PER>Hagrid</PER> “We’ve got to go,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
“<PER>Harry</PER> can’t just sit there on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, waiting for the executioner!” “Sunset, though,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who was staring out the window in a glazed sort of way.
if <PER>Snape</PER> sees me anywhere near there again, I’m in serious trouble,” <PER>Snape</PER> finished.
“That’s true,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, getting to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet.
“But — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t wait for the rest of his sentence; <PER>Hermione</PER> strode across the room, pushed open the Fat Lady’s portrait and vanished from sight.
<PER>Hermione</PER> returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I don’t know what’s gotten into you lately!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, astounded.
“First you hit <PER>Malfoy</PER>, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather flattered.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the cloak hidden down the front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes; <PER>Harry</PER> had to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms folded to hide the lump.
<PER>Hermione</PER> poked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head around the door.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s was a minute in answering, and when <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s did, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s looked all around for <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's visitor, pale-faced and trembling.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> shut the door quickly and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the cloak.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was not crying, nor did <PER>Harry</PER> throw <PER>Harry</PER> upon their necks.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked like a man who did not know where <PER>Harry</PER> was or what to do.
“Where’s Buckbeak, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hesitantly.
“I’ll do it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked back hopelessly.
“Isn’t there anything anyone can do, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked fiercely, sitting down next to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> “He’s tried,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Well stay with you too, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” she began, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> shook his shaggy head.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt strangely unreal, and even more so when <PER>Harry</PER> saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree behind <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s pumpkin patch.
“It’s okay ” He turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, we can’t — ” “Well tell them what really happened — ” “them can’t kill him — ” “Go!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> fiercely.
As <PER>Hermione</PER> threw the cloak over <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, they heard voices at the front of the cabin.
Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off silently around <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house.
“Oh, please, <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
“It’s Scabbers — he won’t — stay put — ” <PER>Ron</PER> was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink the rat's teeth into <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand.
“Scabbers, it’s me, you idiot, it<PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed.
“Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, please let’s move, they’re going to do it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> breathed.
“Okay — Scabbers, stay put — ” They walked forward; <PER>Harry</PER>, like <PER>Hermione</PER>, was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them.
“They did it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
Without thinking about what he was doing, he made to turn back, but both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seized his arms.
“What’s the matter with him?” But <PER>Harry</PER> had just seen — slinking toward them, <PER>Harry</PER>'s body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness — Crookshanks.
In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him, and before <PER>Harry</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> could stop him, <PER>Ron</PER> had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.
“<PER>Ron</PER>\” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the cloak; <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> hurtled after <PER>Ron</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.
“Gotchal Get off, you stinking cat — ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> almost fell over <PER>Ron</PER>; they skidded to a stop right in front of him.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — come on — back under the cloak — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> panted.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached for <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, but too late — the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; him keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; him felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth — But the force of its leap had carried the force of its leap too far; the force of its leap rolled off him.
Dazed, feeling as though him's ribs were broken, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to stand up; <PER>Harry</PER> could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.
As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed <PER>Harry</PER> aside; the dog’s jaws fastened instead around <PER>Ron</PER>’s outstretched arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> lunged forward, <PER>Harry</PER> seized a handful of the brute’s hair, but it was dragging <PER>Ron</PER> away as easily as though <PER>Harry</PER> were a rag doll — Then, out of nowhere, something hit <PER>Harry</PER> so hard across the face <PER>Harry</PER> was knocked off <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet again.
<PER>Harry</PER> groped for <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, blinking blood out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes — “Lumos\” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging <PER>Ron</PER> backward into a large gap in the roots — <PER>Ron</PER> was fighting furiously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight — “<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and <PER>Harry</PER> was forced backward again.
All they could see now was one of <PER>Ron</PER>’s legs, which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground — but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg had broken, and a moment later, <PER>Ron</PER>’s's foot vanished from sight.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — we’ve got to go for help — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped; she was bleeding too; the Willow had cut shis across the shoulder.
“If that dog can get in, we can,” <PER>Harry</PER> panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree’s blows.
<PER>Hermione</PER> now grasped <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm painfully hard.
<PER>Harry</PER> went next; <PER>Harry</PER> crawled forward, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel.
All <PER>Harry</PER> could think of was <PER>Ron</PER> and what the enormous dog might be doing to him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> paused, gasping for breath, edging forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked very frightened but nodded.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> out of the hole, staring around.
<PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm again.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” she whispered, “I think we’re in the Shrieking Shack.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s grip on <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm was so tight <PER>Harry</PER> was losing feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> dashed across to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — are you okay?” “Where’s the dog?” “Not a dog,” <PER>Ron</PER> moaned.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped in a petrified whisper; <PER>Ron</PER>, however, spoke to Black.
“You will damage that leg even more.” “Did you hear me?” <PER>Ron</PER> said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to <PER>Harry</PER> to stay upright.
“Why’s that?” <PER>Harry</PER> spat, trying to wrench himself free of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Be quiet!” “HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!” <PER>Harry</PER> roared, and with a huge effort <PER>Harry</PER> broke free of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s restraint and lunged forward — <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten about magic — <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten that <PER>Harry</PER> was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man — all <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that all <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to hurt Black as badly as all <PER>Harry</PER> could and that all <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t care how much all <PER>Harry</PER> got hurt in return — Perhaps it was the shock of <PER>Harry</PER> doing something so stupid, but Black didn’t raise the wands in time — one of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hands fastened over <PER>Harry</PER>'s wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of <PER>Harry</PER>’s other hand collided with the side of Black’s head and they fell, backward, into the wall — <PER>Hermione</PER> was screaming; <PER>Ron</PER> was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black’s hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed <PER>Harry</PER>’s face by inches; <PER>Harry</PER> felt the shrunken arm under <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers twisting madly, but <PER>Harry</PER> clung on, <PER>Harry</PER>'s other hand punching every part of Black it could find.
But Black’s free hand had found <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat — “No,” he hissed, “I’ve waited too long — ” The fingers tightened, <PER>Harry</PER> choked, <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses askew.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s foot swing out of nowhere.
Black let go of <PER>Harry</PER> with a grunt of pain; <PER>Ron</PER> had thrown himself on Black’s wand hand and <PER>Harry</PER> heard a faint clatter — himself fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw himself's own wand rolling across the floor; himself threw himself toward it but — “Argh!” Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm; <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> off, but Crookshanks now darted toward <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand — “NO YOU DONT!” roared <PER>Harry</PER>, and YOU DONT!” aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; <PER>Harry</PER> snatched up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and turned — “Get out of the way!” he shouted at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, gasping for breath, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s wands.
Black thin chest rose and fell rapidly as Black watched <PER>Harry</PER> walking slowly nearer, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand pointing straight at Black’s heart.
“Going to kill me, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped right above him, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand still pointing at Black’s chest, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But if you knew the whole story.” “The whole story?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, a furious pounding in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
He turned He's ugly, squashed face to <PER>Harry</PER> and looked up at <PER>Harry</PER> with those great yellow eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared down at Black and Crookshanks, <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip tightening on the wand.
And still <PER>Harry</PER> stood frozen there, wand poised, Black staring up at <PER>Harry</PER>, Crookshanks on his chest.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s ragged breathing came from near the bed; <PER>Hermione</PER> was quite silent.
“WE’RE UP HERE — SIRIUS BLACK — QUICK!” Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; <PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand convulsively — Do it nouA said a voice in nouA's head — but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and <PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t done it.
His eyes flickered over <PER>Ron</PER>, lying on the floor, over <PER>Hermione</PER>, cowering next to the door, to <PER>Harry</PER>, standing there with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand covering Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and bleeding at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet.
Mystified, <PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked bewildered.
“Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> interrupted loudly, “what’s going on — ?” But <PER>Harry</PER> never finished the question, because what <PER>Harry</PER> saw made <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice die in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the bottom had dropped out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
“You — you — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER> — ” “ — you and him!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, calm down — ” “I didn’t tell anyone!” <PER>Hermione</PER> shrieked.
“I can explain — ” <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER> shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of fury.
“I trusted you,” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted at Lupin, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice wavering out of control, “and all the time you’ve been <PER>Harry</PER>'s friend!” “You’re wrong,” said Lupin.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, don’t trust <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s been helping Black get into the castle, <PER>Harry</PER> wants you dead too — <PER>Harry</PER>’s a werewolf.” There was a ringing silence.
Then, with an obvious effort, him turned to <PER>Hermione</PER> and said, “How long have you known?” “Ages,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “I’m not,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“At least, the staff do.” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> hired you when “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew you were a werewolf?” <PER>Ron</PER> gasped.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> voiced what <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking.
“Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.” “Peter’S NOT PETER, Peter’S SCABBERS!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting too hard; <PER>Ron</PER> swayed and overbalanced, and <PER>Harry</PER> caught him and pushed him back down to the bed.
“Right again, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER>!
<PER>Ron</PER> started to interrupt, but <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Shh!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was watching Lupin very intently.
“He’s teaching here as well.” He looked up at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Severus <PER>Snape</PER> was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, Severus <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand pointing directly at Lupin.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d received a huge electric shock.
“You haven’t heard everything — I can explain — Sirius is not here to kill <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “Two more for Azkaban tonight,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, his eyes now gleaming fanatically.
With a roar of rage, Black started toward <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Snape</PER> pointed <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand straight between Black’s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, took an uncertain step toward <PER>Snape</PER> and said, in a very breathless voice, “Professor <PER>Snape</PER> — it — it wouldn’t hurt to hear what they’ve got to say, w — would it?” “Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,” <PER>Snape</PER> spat.
“The rat — look at the rat — ” But there was a mad glint in <PER>Snape</PER> ’s eyes that <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen before.
<PER>Harry</PER> clicked <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands.
Before <PER>Snape</PER> could take even one step toward him, <PER>Snape</PER> had raised <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand.
There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; <PER>Snape</PER> was lifted off <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under <PER>Snape</PER>'s hair.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had tried to disarm <PER>Snape</PER> at exactly the same moment.
It was the photograph of <PER>Ron</PER> and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on <PER>Ron</PER>’s shoulder, was Scabbers.
Scabbers had been looking ill before <PER>Harry</PER> met Crookshanks ever since <PER>Ron</PER>’s return from Egypt since the time when Black had escaped.
“Then I should’ve let <PER>Snape</PER> take you!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“<PER>Harry</PER> WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER!
“<PER>Harry</PER> I as good as killed them,” <PER>Harry</PER> croaked.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and <PER>Snape</PER>’s's wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in <PER>Snape</PER>'s face.
He was a very short man, hardly taller than <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes dart to the door and back again.
“I’d like to clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if you’d be so — ” “He’s come to try and kill me again!” Pettigrew squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> used <PER>Harry</PER>'s middle finger, because <PER>Harry</PER>'s index was missing.
“If <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s supporters were after me, it was because I put one of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s supporters's best men in Azkaban — the spy, Sirius Black!” Black’s face contorted.
Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though he had never seen anything quite like <PER>Hermione</PER>.
If he gave them <PER>Harry</PER>, who’d dare say he’d betrayed Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?
“No!” Pettigrew had fallen to Pettigrew's knees as though <PER>Harry</PER>’s nod had been <PER>Harry</PER>'s own death sentence.
<PER>Harry</PER> shuffled forward on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, groveling, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands clasped in front of him as though praying.
“<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> you look just like your father just like <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran forward, placing <PER>Harry</PER> in front of Pettigrew, facing the wands.
“Stand aside, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, I can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.” He hurried over to <PER>Ron</PER>, bent down, tapped <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg with his wand, and muttered, “Ferula.” Bandages spun up <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.
“Thanks.” “What about Professor <PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a small voice, looking down at Professor <PER>Snape</PER>’s prone figure.
“There’s nothing seriously wrong with him,” said Lupin, bending over Professor <PER>Snape</PER> and checking Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s pulse.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> brought up the rear.
<PER>Harry</PER> went right after Black, who was still making <PER>Snape</PER> drift along ahead of them; <PER>Harry</PER> kept bumping <PER>Harry</PER>'s lolling head on the low ceiling.
Did Black mean what <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> meant?
“I understand, I just thought I’d — ” “Are you insane?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice easily as croaky as Black’s.
Black saw <PER>Snape</PER> up through the hole, then stood back for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to pass.
What would happen when <PER>Harry</PER> told the Dursleys <PER>Harry</PER> was going to live with the convict they’d seen on television !
<PER>Snape</PER> was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black, <PER>Snape</PER>'s chin bumping on <PER>Snape</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Snape</PER> collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had stopped abruptly.
He flung out one arm to make <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stop.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s bald tail whip through the manacle on <PER>Ron</PER>’s outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass.
There was a howl and a rumbling growl; <PER>Harry</PER> turned to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into the forest — “Sirius, <PER>Harry</PER>’s gone, Pettigrew transformed!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at <PER>Harry</PER>’s words <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of <PER>Harry</PER>'s paws faded to silence as <PER>Harry</PER> pounded away across the grounds.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> dashed over to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s eyes were only half-closed, <PER>Ron</PER>’s's mouth hung open; <PER>Ron</PER>’s was definitely alive, they could hear <PER>Ron</PER>’s breathing, but <PER>Ron</PER>’s didn’t seem to recognize they.
“We’d better get them up to the castle and tell someone,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pushing <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, trying to think straight.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a moment’s indecision, but there was nothing they could do for <PER>Ron</PER> at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble — <PER>Harry</PER> set off at a run, <PER>Hermione</PER> right behind him.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, think of something happy!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, blinking furiously to try and clear <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it — I’m going to live with my godfather.
At the same moment, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Hermione</PER> collapse next to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Expecto — expecto patronum — ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees hit the cold grass.
A paralyzing terror filled <PER>Harry</PER> so that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t move or speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> mother was screaming in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
With every ounce of strength he could muster, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the lake.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to pat it someone who looked strangely familiar but it couldn’t be <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t understand.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt the last of <PER>Harry</PER>'s strength leave <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s head hit the ground as He fainted.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s brain seemed to be moving a little faster, and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved <PER>Harry</PER>'s head over on the pillow.
It was ajar, and the voices of <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge and <PER>Snape</PER> were coming through it from the corridor outside.
she placed the chocolate on <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedside table and began breaking the chocolate on <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedside table apart with a small hammer.
“How’s <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“As for you two you’ll be staying here until I’m satisfied you’re — Potter, what do you think you’re doing?” <PER>Harry</PER> was sitting up, putting <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses back on, and picking up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
But his shout had been heard in the corridor outside; next second, <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge and <PER>Snape</PER> had entered the ward.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, what’s this?” said Fudge, looking agitated.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, you’re very confused, you’ve been through a dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now, we’ve got everything under control.
“YOU VE GOT THE WRONG MAN!” “Minister, listen, please,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said; <PER>Hermione</PER> had hurried to <PER>Harry</PER>’s side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge’s face.
“If they’d just listen But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth; <PER>Harry</PER> choked, and Madam Pomfrey seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> swallowed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again.
“Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive — ” “That, indeed, is Black’s story,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, surveying <PER>Snape</PER> closely through <PER>Snape</PER>'s half-moon spectacles.
“You didn’t arrive in time to hear — ” “Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!” “Now, <PER>Snape</PER>,” said Fudge, startled, “the young lady is disturbed in the young lady's mind, we must make allowances — ” “I would like to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> abruptly.
“<PER>Cornelius</PER>, Severus, Poppy — please leave us.” “Headmaster!” sputtered Madam Pomfrey “They need treatment, They need rest — ” “This cannot wait,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“You surely don’t believe a word of Black’s story?” <PER>Snape</PER> whispered, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes fixed on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face.
“I wish to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> repeated.
<PER>Snape</PER> took a step toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> turned on <PER>Snape</PER>'s heel and marched through the door Fudge was still holding.
It closed behind them, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Professor, Black’s telling the truth — we saw Pettigrew — ” “ — he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf — ” “ — he’s a rat — ” “ — Pettigrew’s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off “ — Pettigrew attacked <PER>Ron</PER>, it wasn’t Sirius — ” But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> held up <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hand to stem the flood of explanations.
“What we need,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> slowly, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s light blue eyes moved from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “is more time.” “But — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had turned on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s heel and looked back as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reached the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the sensation that <PER>Harry</PER> was flying very fast, backward.
A blur of colors and shapes rushed past <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears were pounding, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to yell but couldn’t hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s own voice — And then <PER>Harry</PER> felt solid ground beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, and everything came into focus again — his was standing next to <PER>Hermione</PER> in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, what — ?” “In here!” <PER>Hermione</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and dragged <PER>Harry</PER> across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed <PER>Harry</PER> inside among the buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them.
“What — how — <PER>Hermione</PER>, what happened?” “We’ve gone back in time,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, lifting the chain off <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck in the darkness.
“Three hours back ” <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s own leg and gave his own leg a very hard pinch.
“Footsteps across the hall yes, I think it’s us going down to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s!” “Are you telling me,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, “that we’re here in this cupboard and we’re out there too?” “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her ear still glued to the cupboard door.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, we’re going to save Buckbeak!” “But — how will that help Sirius?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said — ““<PER>Dumbledore</PER> just told us where the window is — the window of Flitwick’s office!
<PER>Harry</PER> stood up and pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear against the door.
Safe in the shadows of the trees, <PER>Harry</PER> turned around; seconds later, <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived beside <PER>Harry</PER>, panting.
And <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Harry</PER>'s own voice.
“That’s <PER>Hagrid</PER> breaking the milk jug,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
And sure enough, moments later, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s back door opened, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw himself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> walking out of it with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Then he turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched the grass flatten in patches all around <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone but the <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s head out of sight as Macnair’s face appeared at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s window, staring out at Buckbeak.
“Wait here,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’ll do it.” As Fudge’s voice started again, <PER>Harry</PER> darted out from behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.
” <PER>Harry</PER> threw all <PER>Harry</PER>'s weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in <PER>Harry</PER>'s front feet.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, hurry!” <PER>Hermione</PER> mouthed.
<PER>Harry</PER> could still hear <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s voice talking from within the cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn’t see <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s garden at all.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
And then came the howling, and this time they could hear <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s words through <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s's sobs.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> tightened <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s grip and dug <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s heels into the forest floor to stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
“There’s <PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched himself and <PER>Hermione</PER> chasing after <PER>Ron</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> dive.
They saw him bowl <PER>Harry</PER> over, then seize <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching the dog pulling <PER>Ron</PER> into the roots.
“If only <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had come with us ” “Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, <PER>Snape</PER>’d never be able to get it and — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, we mustn’t be seen!” “How can you stand this?” he asked <PER>Hermione</PER> fiercely.
“I’m going to grab the cloak!” “<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” <PER>Hermione</PER> seized the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes not a moment too soon.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s fists clenched as they watched <PER>Snape</PER> skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s mouth was slightly open by the time <PER>Harry</PER> had finished.
“I think it was my dad.” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced up at <PER>Hermione</PER> and saw that <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth was fully open now.
“You think you saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s ghost?” “I don’t know no <PER>Harry</PER> looked solid.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to look at Buckbeak, who was digging <PER>Harry</PER>'s beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms.
<PER>Harry</PER> was thinking about <PER>Harry</PER>'s father and about <PER>Harry</PER>'s father’s three oldest friends Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sat with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face turned toward the Willow, waiting.
She and <PER>Harry</PER> got to She and <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
They saw Lupin, Pettigrew, and <PER>Ron</PER> clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots followed by the unconscious <PER>Snape</PER>, drifting weirdly upward.
Next came <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Black.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> muttered as though she knew exactly what <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking, “we’ve got to stay put.
“He’s transforming — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly.
The cabin was in sight; <PER>Harry</PER> skidded to the door, wrenched the door open, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and Buckbeak flashed past him; <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> in after them and bolted the door.
“But if we don’t see what’s going on, how’re we going to know when it’s time to rescue Sirius?” “Well okay, then I’ll wait here with Buckbeak but <PER>Harry</PER>, be careful — there’s a werewolf out there — and the dementors — ” <PER>Harry</PER> stepped outside again and edged around the cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared out toward the lake, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart doing a kind of drumroll in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no thought in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head except his father.
<PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> behind it, peering desperately through the leaves.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake.
him hadn’t seen him's father — him had seen him — <PER>Harry</PER> flung — <PER>Harry</PER> out from behind the bush and pulled out — <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
And <PER>Harry</PER> realized “Prongs,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
Then, with a great leap of <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart, <PER>Harry</PER> heard hooves behind <PER>Harry</PER> — his whirled around and saw <PER>Hermione</PER> dashing toward <PER>Harry</PER>, dragging Buckbeak behind <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Get behind here — behind this bush — I’ll explain.” <PER>Hermione</PER> listened to what had just happened with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth open yet again.
<PER>Snape</PER> was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Black onto them.
“Right, it’s nearly time,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tensely, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch.
<PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s flanks with <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was holding <PER>Harry</PER> very tight around the waist; <PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Hermione</PER>'s muttering, “Oh, no — I don’t like this — oh, I really don’t like this — ” <PER>Harry</PER> urged Buckbeak forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> was trying to count the windows flashing past — “Whoa!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, pulling backward as hard as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s jaw drop.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt from <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair, hurried to the window and tried to open the window, but the window was locked.
“Stand back!” <PER>Hermione</PER> called to him, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, still gripping the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes with her left hand.
“Get on — there’s not much time,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, gripping Buckbeak firmly on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleek neck to hold <PER>Harry</PER> steady.
Buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> slid off <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was tugging at his sleeve, staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch.
“We’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing We — before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> locks the door — ” “Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wrenching <PER>Harry</PER>'s gaze from the sky, “let’s go.
only hope <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s not going to make difficulties,” <PER>Snape</PER> was saying.
He caught a glimpse of <PER>Snape</PER>’s smirk as He and Fudge passed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hiding place.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> waited a few moments to make sure <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’d really gone, then started to run in the opposite direction.
“Peeves\” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, grabbing <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wrist.
“Oh, his’s horrible,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s ear to the door.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back inside — before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> locks the door?” <PER>Harry</PER> panted.
“I don’t want to think about it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned, checking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch again.
“Okay — I can hear <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tensely.
Panicking, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ran forward.
“Yes, I think you’ve gone too — get inside — I’ll lock you in — ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> slipped back inside the dormitory.
As the lock clicked behind them, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> crept back to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own beds, <PER>Hermione</PER> tucking the Time-Turner back under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> thought it best to accept <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s chocolate quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waiting, listening, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s nerves jangling.
Fudge, <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> came striding into the ward.
Indeed, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> alone looked as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> alone was quite enjoying <PER>Dumbledore</PER> alone.
But <PER>Snape</PER> was beside <PER>Snape</PER>.
“This door’s been locked, we just saw — ” “THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” <PER>Snape</PER> howled, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> face was twisted; spit was flying from <PER>Snape</PER>'s mouth.
“Unless you are suggesting that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> are able to be in two places at once, I’m afraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further.” <PER>Snape</PER> stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly shocked at <PER>Snape</PER>'s behavior, to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, whose eyes were twinkling behind <PER>Snape</PER>'s glasses.
“I’d watch out for Fellow if I were you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
“You explain,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, helping <PER>Harry</PER> to some more chocolate.
When <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the hospital wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost deserted castle.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> felt like going, however, so they and <PER>Harry</PER> wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now.
Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, <PER>Harry</PER> lost the thread of the conversation as <PER>Harry</PER> looked across to the opposite bank.
A shadow fell across them and them looked up to see a very bleary-eyed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, mopping a very bleary-eyed <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s sweaty face with one of a very bleary-eyed <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them.
“Why?” “Leavin’, isn’ he?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking surprised that <PER>Harry</PER> had to ask.
“I’m going to see him,” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I just saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then, while <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to think of a good argument to make <PER>Harry</PER> stay, Lupin said, “From what the headmaster told me this morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t look surprised to see <PER>Harry</PER> there.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down in <PER>Harry</PER>'s vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor.
“Why so miserable, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very — very strange.” “Indeed?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Er — stranger than usual, you mean?” “Yes her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said she said <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s servant was going to set out to return to <PER>Voldemort</PER> before midnight.
“Do you know, <PER>Harry</PER>, I think she might have been,” <PER>Harry</PER> said thoughtfully.
“<PER>Harry</PER> betrayed my parents!” “This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew what <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking.
“your father would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t laugh <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> “I thought it was my dad who’d conjured my Patronus.
Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The whole of <PER>Harry</PER>’s Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about <PER>Harry</PER>'s resignation.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether <PER>Harry</PER> had sought sanctuary with <PER>Voldemort</PER> yet.
And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news, because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help feeling miserable when <PER>Harry</PER> thought of the home <PER>Harry</PER> might have had, and the fact that it was now impossible.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had passed every subject.
<PER>Harry</PER> was amazed that <PER>Harry</PER> had got through Potions.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a shrewd suspicion that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might have stepped in to stop <PER>Snape</PER> failing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on purpose.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s behavior toward <PER>Harry</PER> over the past week had been quite alarming.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have thought it possible that <PER>Snape</PER>’s dislike for <PER>Harry</PER> could increase, but it certainly had.
A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of <PER>Snape</PER>’s thin mouth every time he looked at <PER>Harry</PER>, and he was constantly flexing his fingers, as though itching to place them around <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat.
Even <PER>Harry</PER> managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the next day as <PER>Harry</PER> ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next morning, <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> some surprising news.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain.
“Oh, cheer up, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sadly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly, peering over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly pulled down the window, stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm, and caught the window.
<PER>Harry</PER> ripped open the letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!” “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> excitedly.
“That’ll be good enough for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> happily.
he looked closely at the owl for a moment; then, to <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s great surprise, he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff.
It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three-quarters.
“I’ll call about the World Cup!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled after <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> bid him and <PER>Hermione</PER> good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing him's trunk and Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in him's usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope <PER>Harry</PER> was still clutching in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
