<PER>Harry</PER> tried to argue back but <PER>Harry</PER>'s words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.
“All right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “all right ” Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching <PER>Harry</PER> closely out of the corners of <PER>Harry</PER>'s small, sharp eyes.
Ever since <PER>Harry</PER> had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating Uncle Vernon like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because <PER>Harry</PER> Potter wasn’t a normal boy.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
<PER>Harry</PER> missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, <PER>Harry</PER>'s classes (though perhaps not <PER>Snape</PER>, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).
All <PER>Harry</PER>’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant <PER>Harry</PER> had come home.
What did the Dursleys care if <PER>Harry</PER> lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s place on the House Quidditch team because <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t practiced all summer?
What was it to the Dursleys if <PER>Harry</PER> went back to school without any of <PER>Harry</PER>'s homework done?
<PER>Harry</PER> wore round glasses, and on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.
This scar was the only hint of <PER>Harry</PER>’s very mysterious past, of the reason <PER>Harry</PER> had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, <PER>Harry</PER> had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s parents had died in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s attack, but <PER>Harry</PER> had escaped with <PER>Harry</PER>'s lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood why — <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill <PER>Harry</PER>.
So <PER>Harry</PER> had been brought up by <PER>Harry</PER>'s dead mother’s sister and her husband.
<PER>Harry</PER> had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why <PER>Harry</PER> kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys’ story that <PER>Harry</PER> had got <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar in the car crash that had killed <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents.
<PER>Harry</PER> had taken up <PER>Harry</PER>'s place at wizard school, where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar were famous but now the school year was over, and <PER>Harry</PER> was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s toast.
“And you, boy?” <PER>Harry</PER> fought to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s face straight as <PER>Harry</PER> emerged.
More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, <PER>Harry</PER> missed <PER>Harry</PER>'s best friends, <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
Neither of They had written to him all summer, even though <PER>Ron</PER> had said him was going to ask <PER>Harry</PER> to come and stay.
Countless times, <PER>Harry</PER> had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> with a letter, but it wasn’t worth the risk.
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t told the Dursleys this; <PER>Harry</PER> knew it was only their terror that <PER>Harry</PER> might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking <PER>Harry</PER> in the cupboard under the stairs with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and broomstick.
For the first couple of weeks back, <PER>Harry</PER> had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as <PER>Harry</PER>'s fat legs would carry <PER>Harry</PER>.
But the long silence from <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had made <PER>Harry</PER> feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and now <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had forgotten his birthday.
He’d almost be glad of a sight of He's archenemy, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream.
At the very end of last term, <PER>Harry</PER> had come face-to-face with none other than Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> might be a ruin of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s former self, but <PER>Voldemort</PER> was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power.
<PER>Harry</PER> had slipped through <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, <PER>Harry</PER> kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was now, remembering <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s livid face, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wide, mad eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, not taking <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes off the spot where they had been.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing <PER>Harry</PER> had been thinking <PER>Harry</PER> maybe <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have any friends at Hogwarts.
Wish they could see famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter now, famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thought savagely as famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter spread manure on the flower beds, famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's back aching, sweat running down famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's face.
<PER>Harry</PER> washed <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and bolted down <PER>Harry</PER>'s pitiful supper.
“Remember, boy — one sound — ” <PER>Harry</PER> crossed to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew instantly that this was what had been watching <PER>Harry</PER> out of the garden hedge that morning.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched voice <PER>Harry</PER> was sure would carry down the stairs.
“Never never ever ” <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard the voices downstairs falter.
“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to cheer <PER>Harry</PER> up.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby reverently, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's orb-like eyes aglow.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named — ” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Dobby clapped <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands over <PER>Harry</PER>'s bat ears and moaned, “Ah, speak not the name, sir!
“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter met <PER>Voldemort</PER> for a second time, just weeks ago that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter escaped yet again.” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.
“Ah, sir,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, dabbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter must stay where <PER>Harry</PER> Potter is safe.
“All right!” cried <PER>Harry</PER>, grabbing the elf’s arm to stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> hasn’t got a brother, has <PER>Harry</PER>?” Dobby shook Dobby's head, his eyes wider than ever.
“I mean, there’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, for one thing — you know who ’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is, don’t you?” Dobby bowed Dobby's head.
Stepping nimbly out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s reach, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase <PER>Harry</PER> Potter was wearing.
<PER>Harry</PER> could make out <PER>Hermione</PER>’s neat writing, <PER>Ron</PER>’s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Mouth dry, stomach lurching, <PER>Harry</PER> sprang after <PER>Harry</PER>, trying not to make a sound.
She’s been dying to hear ” <PER>Harry</PER> ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach disappear.
Yours sincerely, Mafalda Hopkirk IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE Ministry of Magic <PER>Harry</PER> looked up from the letter and gulped.
Otherwise, <PER>Harry</PER> was locked in <PER>Harry</PER>'s room around the clock.
Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see any way out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s situation.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Dobby might have saved <PER>Harry</PER> from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, <PER>Harry</PER>’d probably starve to death anyway.
<PER>Harry</PER> put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than <PER>Harry</PER> had been before the soup.
Supposing <PER>Harry</PER> was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen if <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t turn up at Hogwarts?
<PER>Harry</PER> dreamed that <PER>Harry</PER> was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to <PER>Harry</PER>'s cage.
“Stop it,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered as the rattling pounded in <PER>Harry</PER>'s sore head.
<PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER> was outside <PER>Harry</PER>’s window.
3 “<PER>Ron</PER>\” breathed <PER>Harry</PER>, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, how did you — What the — ?” <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what <PER>Harry</PER> was seeing hit <PER>Harry</PER>.
Grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> from the front seats were Fred and George, <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder twin brothers.
“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred reversed as close as possible to <PER>Harry</PER>’s window.
“Out of the way, <PER>Harry</PER>.” Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into <PER>Harry</PER>’s room.
You had to hand it to them, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, as George took an ordinary hairpin from <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and started to pick the lock.
<PER>Harry</PER> dashed around <PER>Harry</PER>'s room, collecting <PER>Harry</PER>'s things and passing them out of the window to <PER>Ron</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> went to help Fred and George heave <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk up the stairs.
Fred climbed back into the car to pull with <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> and George pushed from the bedroom side.
“One good push — ” <PER>Harry</PER> and George threw <PER>Harry</PER> and George's shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car.
But as <PER>Harry</PER> climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind <PER>Harry</PER>, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon’s voice.
“THAT RUDDY OWL!” “I’ve forgotten Hedwig!” <PER>Harry</PER> tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on — <PER>Harry</PER> snatched up Hedwig’s cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to <PER>Ron</PER>.
For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then Uncle Vernon let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at <PER>Harry</PER>, grabbing <PER>Harry</PER> by the ankle.
<PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms and pulled as hard as they could.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe it — <PER>Harry</PER> was free.
— <PER>Harry</PER> rolled down the window, the night air whipping — <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive.
The <PER>Weasley</PER>s roared with laughter and <PER>Harry</PER> settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear.
“So — what’s the story, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently.
“What’s been happening?” <PER>Harry</PER> told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d given <PER>Harry</PER> and the fiasco of the violet pudding.
“<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> explained.
“He hates me.” “<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said George, turning around.
“Not <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s son?” “Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He was a big supporter of <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” “And when <PER>Voldemort</PER> disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, “<PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> came back saying <PER>Voldemort</PER>’d never meant any of it.
Judging by the fact that <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> usually had the best of everything, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s family was rolling in wizard gold; <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> could just see <PER>Malfoy</PER> strutting around a large manor house.
Sending the family servant to stop <PER>Harry</PER> from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing <PER>Malfoy</PER> would do.
they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked out for the first time at <PER>Ron</PER>’s house.
It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which, <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>, it probably was).
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, I sleep at the — at the top — ” <PER>Ron</PER> had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house.
“Come in and have some breakfast.” She turned and walked back into the house and <PER>Harry</PER>, after a nervous glance at <PER>Ron</PER>, who nodded encouragingly, followed She.
There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and <PER>Harry</PER> sat down on the edge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat, looking around.
Every now and then Molly muttered things like “don’t know what you were thinking of,” and “never would have believed it.” “I don’t blame you, dear,” Molly assured <PER>Harry</PER>, tipping eight or nine sausages onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s plate.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in an undertone to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You didn’t ask them to fly that wretched car — ” But <PER>Harry</PER>, who felt wide awake, said quickly, “I’ll help <PER>Ron</PER>.
“All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there’s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.” Yawning and grumbling, the <PER>Weasley</PER>s slouched outside with <PER>Harry</PER> behind them.
“Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> as they crossed the lawn.
Seeing the shocked look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, <PER>Ron</PER> added, “It doesn’t hurt them — you’ve just got to make them really dizzy so them can’t find them's way back to the gnomeholes.” He let go of the gnome’s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.
<PER>Harry</PER> decided just to drop the first one <PER>Harry</PER> caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into <PER>Harry</PER>’s finger and <PER>Harry</PER> had a hard job shaking it off — until — “Wow, <PER>Harry</PER> — that must’ve been fifty feet.
“<PER>Harry</PER> who?” He looked around, saw <PER>Harry</PER>, and jumped.
<PER>Harry</PER> just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at <PER>Harry</PER> before it closed with a snap.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stepped in, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Ron</PER> had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically.
In the field far below <PER>Harry</PER> could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the <PER>Weasley</PER>s’ hedge.
<PER>Harry</PER> got a shock the first time <PER>Harry</PER> looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, “ Tuck your shirt in, scruff yV’ The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George’s bedroom were considered perfectly normal.
“Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.” <PER>Harry</PER> heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after <PER>Harry</PER> had arrived at the Burrow.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> went down to breakfast to find Mister and Mistress <PER>Weasley</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> already sitting at the kitchen table.
The moment she saw <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER> accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter.
<PER>Ginny</PER> seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever <PER>Harry</PER> entered a room.
<PER>Ginny</PER> dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with <PER>Ginny</PER>'s face glowing like the setting sun.
Pretending <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t noticed this, <PER>Harry</PER> sat down and took the toast Molly offered <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Letters from school,” said Arthur, passing <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> already knows you’re here, <PER>Harry</PER> — doesn’t miss a trick, that man.
“I expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s things secondhand.” “Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Fortunately no one saw this except <PER>Harry</PER>, because just then <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder brother Percy walked in.
just then <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder brother Percy was already dressed, just then <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder brother Percy's Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to just then <PER>Ron</PER>’s elder brother Percy's sweater vest.
“Lovely day.” He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath He a molting, gray feather duster — at least, that was what <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was, until <PER>Harry</PER> saw that it was breathing.
“What ’re you all up to today?” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the <PER>Weasley</PER>s owned.
they took turns riding <PER>Harry</PER>’s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; <PER>Ron</PER>’s old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.
<PER>Harry</PER> had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; <PER>Harry</PER> stayed shut in <PER>Harry</PER>'s room the rest of the time.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s not <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared at them all watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, watch us first.” <PER>Harry</PER> took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.
<PER>Harry</PER> took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash.
Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before <PER>Harry</PER>’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass — and one of two people was the very last person <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to meet when <PER>Harry</PER> was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left; <PER>Harry</PER> shot inside a large black cabinet and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through.
Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, “Touch nothing, <PER>Draco</PER>.” <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I thought you were going to buy me a present.” “I said I would buy you a racing broom,” said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter.
everyone thinks he’s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick — ” “You have told me this at least a dozen times already,” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, with a quelling look at Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s son.
“And I would remind you that it is not — prudent — to appear less than fond of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made <PER>Voldemort</PER> disappear — ah, Mister Borgin.” A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing A stooping man's greasy hair back from A stooping man's face.
“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mister Borgin, abandoning Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s list and scurrying over to <PER>Draco</PER>.
“The teachers all have favorites, that <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger — ” “I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Ha!” said <PER>Harry</PER> under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, pleased to see <PER>Draco</PER> looking both abashed and angry.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched nervously as <PER>Draco</PER> drew nearer and nearer to <PER>Harry</PER>'s hiding place, examining the objects for sale.
<PER>Draco</PER> turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of <PER>Draco</PER>.
<PER>Draco</PER> walked forward — <PER>Draco</PER> stretched out <PER>Draco</PER>'s hand for the handle — “Done,” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> at the counter.
“Come, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> wiped <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead on his sleeve as <PER>Draco</PER> turned away.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited for a minute in case <PER>Harry</PER> came back, then, quietly as <PER>Harry</PER> could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.
Clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s broken glasses to his face, <PER>Harry</PER> stared around.
Feeling jumpy, <PER>Harry</PER> set off, trying to hold <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses on straight and hoping against hope <PER>Harry</PER>’d be able to find a way out of here.
<PER>Harry</PER> supposed <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t spoken clearly enough through <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouthful of ashes back in the <PER>Weasley</PER>s’ fire.
“Not lost are you, my dear?” said a voice in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear, making <PER>Harry</PER> jump.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> croaked in relief.
“I was lost — Floo powder — ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER> by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands.
“Yer a mess!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> gruffly, brushing soot off <PER>Harry</PER> so forcefully he nearly knocked he into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary.
“Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno — dodgy place, <PER>Harry</PER> — don’ want no one ter see yeh down there — ” “I realized that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ducking as <PER>Hagrid</PER> made to brush him off again.
“How come yeh never wrote back ter me?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s enormous boots).
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, George, Percy, and Arthur.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> — oh, my dear — you could have been anywhere — ” Gasping for breath <PER>Ginny</PER> pulled a large clothes brush out of <PER>Ginny</PER>'s bag and began sweeping off the soot <PER>Hagrid</PER> hadn’t managed to beat away.
“Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they climbed the Gringotts steps.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> and his father.” “Did <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> buy anything?” said Arthur sharply behind them.
“Oh, I’d love to get <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> for something.
“Meet you back here,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER> as the <PER>Weasley</PER>s and <PER>Harry</PER> were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.
<PER>Harry</PER> enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the <PER>Weasley</PER>s’ vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than <PER>Harry</PER> had in Knock- turn Alley, when it was opened.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt even worse when they reached <PER>Harry</PER>'s vault.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to block the contents from view as <PER>Harry</PER> hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> strolled off along the winding, cobbled street.
The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in <PER>Harry</PER>’s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so <PER>Harry</PER> bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows.
<PER>Ron</PER> gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until <PER>Hermione</PER> dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door.
him saw <PER>Ron</PER> — and then him saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then him leapt to him's feet and positively shouted, “It can’t be <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm, and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> to the front.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s face burned as Lockhart shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the <PER>Weasley</PER>s.
“Together, you and I are worth the front page.” When he finally let go of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to sidle back over to the <PER>Weasley</PER>s, but Lockhart threw an arm around Lockhart's shoulders and clamped him tightly to him's side.
“He had no idea,” Lockhart continued, giving <PER>Harry</PER> a little shake that made <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses slip to the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose, “that <PER>Harry</PER> would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me.
Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where <PER>Ginny</PER> was standing next to <PER>Ginny</PER>'s new cauldron.
<PER>Harry</PER> straightened up and found <PER>Harry</PER> face-to-face with <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was wearing his usual sneer.
“Famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.” “Leave him <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want all that!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
It was the first time <PER>Ginny</PER> had spoken in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> went scarlet as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books.
“Oh, it’s you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking at <PER>Malfoy</PER> as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe.
“Bet you’re surprised to see <PER>Harry</PER> here, eh?” “Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, <PER>Weasley</PER>,” retorted <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.” <PER>Ron</PER> went as red as <PER>Ginny</PER>.
He dropped He's books into the cauldron, too, and started toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket.
“Dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?” Arthur flushed darker than either <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“The company you keep, <PER>Weasley</PER> and I thought your family could sink no lower — ” There was a thud of metal as <PER>Ginny</PER>’s cauldron went flying; Arthur had thrown Arthur at Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, knocking Arthur backward into a bookshelf.
“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your father can give you — ” Pulling himself out of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s grip himself beckoned to <PER>Draco</PER> and swept from the shop.
“Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that — no <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s worth listenin’ ter — bad blood, that’s what it is — come on now — let’s get outta here.” The assistant looked as though The assistant wanted to stop them from leaving, but The assistant barely came up to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s waist and seemed to think better of it.
<PER>Harry</PER> took off <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and put them safely in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket before helping himself to Floo powder.
“Not a word to Molly,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> opened the trunk and showed <PER>Harry</PER> how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily.
When at last they were all in the car, Molly glanced into the back seat, where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, “Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don’t them?” Molly and <PER>Ginny</PER> got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench.
they had almost reached the highway when <PER>Ginny</PER> shrieked that <PER>Ginny</PER>’d left <PER>Ginny</PER>'s diary.
“I’ll take <PER>Ginny</PER> and you two come right after us,” Mistress <PER>Weasley</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, grabbing <PER>Ginny</PER>’s hand and setting off.
“Let’s go together, we’ve only got a minute,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> made sure that Hedwig’s cage was safely wedged on top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and wheeled <PER>Harry</PER>'s trolley around to face the barrier.
Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; <PER>Ron</PER>’s trunk fell off with a loud thump, <PER>Harry</PER> was knocked off <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, and Hedwig’s cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and Hedwig rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think you’re doing?” “Lost control of the trolley,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs as <PER>Harry</PER> got up.
“Why can’t we get through?” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I don’t understand why the gateway’s sealed the gateway’s — ” <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
“We’re attracting too much atten — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his eyes gleaming.
<PER>Harry</PER> stuck <PER>Harry</PER>'s head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel the seat vibrating beneath <PER>Harry</PER>, hear the engine, feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses on <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose, but for all <PER>Harry</PER> could see, <PER>Harry</PER> had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.
Then there was a popping noise and the car, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> reappeared.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> had pulled off He and <PER>Ron</PER>'s sweaters, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s T-shirt was sticking to the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat and <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses kept sliding down to the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweaty nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged nervous glances.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest.
“Not far,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, more to the car than to <PER>Harry</PER>, “not far now,” and <PER>Harry</PER> patted the dashboard nervously.
“There!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, making <PER>Ron</PER> and Hedwig jump.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> gripping the edges of <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat very hard as they flew toward the lake.
Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golf-ball-sized lump was throbbing on <PER>Harry</PER>’s head where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, <PER>Ron</PER> let out a low, despairing groan.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to say <PER>Harry</PER> was sure they’d be able to mend it up at the school, but <PER>Harry</PER> never even got started.
At that very moment, something hit <PER>Harry</PER>'s side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into <PER>Ron</PER>, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof.
“What’s happen — ?” <PER>Ron</PER> gasped, staring through the windshield, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it.
“Aaargh!” said <PER>Ron</PER> as another twisted limb punched a large dent into <PER>Ron</PER> as another twisted limb's door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving — “Run for it!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, throwing his full weight against his , but next second his had been knocked backward into <PER>Harry</PER>’s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch.
With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat tip sideways: Next thing <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was sprawled on the damp ground.
“Hey — <PER>Harry</PER> — come and look — it’s the Sorting!” <PER>Harry</PER> hurried over and, together, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> peered in at the Great Hall.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was among them, easily visible because of <PER>Ginny</PER>'s vivid <PER>Weasley</PER> hair.
<PER>Harry</PER> well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for it decision as it muttered aloud in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear.
For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the rest of the <PER>Weasley</PER>s.
Last term, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes wandered past A very small, mousy-haired boy to where Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight.
“Hang on ” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> also happened to be <PER>Snape</PER> ’s least favorite student.
Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from <PER>Harry</PER>'s own House (Slytherin), <PER>Snape</PER> taught Potions.
“Maybe he’s left,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because <PER>Harry</PER> missed out on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again).” “Or <PER>Harry</PER> might have been sacked).” said <PER>Ron</PER> enthusiastically.
“I mean, everyone hates <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them, “he’s waiting to hear why you two didn’t arrive on the school train.” <PER>Harry</PER> spun around.
There, <PER>Harry</PER>'s black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was smiling in a way that told <PER>Harry</PER> He and <PER>Ron</PER> were in very deep trouble.
Not daring even to look at each other, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed <PER>Snape</PER> up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches.
<PER>Snape</PER> closed the door and turned to look at <PER>Snape</PER>.
“So,” he said softly, “the train isn’t good enough for the famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and his faithful sidekick, <PER>Weasley</PER>.
This wasn’t the first time <PER>Snape</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> the impression of being able to read minds.
“Dear, dear his own son ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree’s larger branches.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind <PER>Snape</PER> ’s desk.
If <PER>Snape</PER> had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, <PER>Snape</PER> had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House were hardly any better off.
Ten minutes later, <PER>Snape</PER> returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten just how thin Professor McGonagall's mouth could go, or <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen Professor McGonagall's this angry before.
She raised Shis wand the moment She entered; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both flinched, but She merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared down <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s very crooked nose at them, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly found <PER>Harry</PER> wishing <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow.
Then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “Please explain why you did this.” It would have been better if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had shouted.
<PER>Harry</PER> hated the disappointment in <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
For some reason, <PER>Harry</PER> was unable to look <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in the eyes, and spoke instead to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees.
<PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> everything except that Arthur owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> knew <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would see through this at once, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked no questions about the car.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, <PER>Harry</PER> merely continued to peer at them through <PER>Harry</PER>'s spectacles.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked quickly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He cleared He's throat and said, “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree — surely acts of this nature — ” “It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys’ punishments, Severus,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
“You’d better get along to the hospital wing, <PER>Weasley</PER>, you’re bleeding.” “Not much,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well they’d just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn’t squashed <PER>Harry</PER> flat.
“Skip the lecture,” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently, “and tell us the new password.” “It’s ‘wattlebird,’ ” said <PER>Hermione</PER> impatiently, “but that’s not the point — ” Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping.
Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> inside, leaving <PER>Hermione</PER> to scramble in after them.
<PER>Harry</PER> nudged <PER>Ron</PER> in the ribs and nodded in Percy’s direction.
“ ’Night,” <PER>Harry</PER> called back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy’s.
<PER>Ron</PER> grinned guiltily at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down at the Gryffindor table next to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug.
<PER>Neville</PER> was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone <PER>Harry</PER> had ever met.
“Mail’s due any minute — I think Gran’s sending a few things I forgot.” <PER>Harry</PER> had only just started <PER>Harry</PER>'s porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd.
A big, lumpy package bounced off <PER>Neville</PER>’s head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into <PER>Hermione</PER>’s jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers.
“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, prodding Errol gently with the tip of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s finger.
It looked quite ordinary to <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode.
“You’d better open it, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> in a timid whisper.
<PER>Neville</PER> stuffed <PER>Neville</PER>'s fingers in his ears.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of <PER>Ron</PER>’s head.
“Well, I don’t know what you expected, <PER>Ron</PER>, but you “Don’t tell me I deserved it,” snapped <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s porridge away.
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had only just joined them when <PER>Hermione</PER> came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart.
<PER>Harry</PER> was about to follow <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> inside when Lockhart’s hand shot out.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lockhart, <PER>Harry</PER>'s large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>.” Completely nonplussed, <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing.
“I know, I know — it’s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have — but it’s a start, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s a start” He gave <PER>Harry</PER> a hearty wink and strode off.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering <PER>Harry</PER> was supposed to be in the greenhouse, <PER>Harry</PER> opened the door and slid inside.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had taken <PER>Harry</PER>'s place between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, she said, “We’ll be repotting Mandrakes today.
“Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sounding as usual as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had swallowed the textbook.
They looked quite unremarkable to <PER>Harry</PER>, who didn’t have the slightest idea what <PER>Hermione</PER> meant by the “cry” of the Mandrake.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy <PER>Harry</PER> knew by sight but had never spoken to.
Everything <PER>Harry</PER> had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head during the summer.
<PER>Harry</PER> was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all <PER>Harry</PER> managed to do was give <PER>Harry</PER>'s beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“ ‘It’s your own fault your wand got snapped — ’ ” They went down to lunch, where <PER>Ron</PER>’s mood was not improved by <PER>Hermione</PER>’s showing They the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in T ransfiguration .
“Why,” demanded <PER>Ron</PER>, seizing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s schedule, “have you outlined all Lockhart’s lessons in little hearts?” <PER>Hermione</PER> snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on a stone step and buried <PER>Hermione</PER>'s nose in Voyages with Vampires again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that he was being closely watched.
he was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment <PER>Harry</PER> looked at he, <PER>Harry</PER> went bright red.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s giving out signed photos!” “No, I’m not,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, <PER>Harry</PER>'s fists clenching.
“Eat slugs, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
“Be careful, <PER>Weasley</PER>,” sneered <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“It’d be worth more than his family’s whole house — ” <PER>Ron</PER> whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but <PER>Hermione</PER> shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, “Look out!” “What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, Gilderoy Lockhart's turquoise robes swirling behind Gilderoy Lockhart.
“Who’s giving out signed photos?” <PER>Harry</PER> started to speak but <PER>Harry</PER> was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders and thundered jovially, “Shouldn’t have asked!
<PER>Harry</PER> yanked <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where <PER>Harry</PER> busied <PER>Harry</PER> with piling all seven of Lockhart’s books in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, so that <PER>Harry</PER> could avoid looking at the real thing.
The rest of the class came clattering in, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’d better hope Creevey doesn’t meet <PER>Ginny</PER>, or they’ll be starting a <PER>Harry</PER> Potter fan club.” “Shut up,” snapped <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned <PER>Hermione</PER>'s name. "
<PER>Neville</PER> was cowering in <PER>Neville</PER>'s front row seat.
Two of The pixies seized <PER>Neville</PER> by the ears and lifted <PER>Neville</PER> into the air.
In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were almost at the door, and said, “Well, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into them's cage.” Lockhart swept past them and shut the door quickly behind Lockhart.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing “Rubbish,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
7 <PER>Harry</PER> spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever <PER>Harry</PER> saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor.
Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, “All right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” six or seven times a day and hear, “Hello, Colin,” back, however exasperated <PER>Harry</PER> sounded when <PER>Harry</PER> said it.
Hedwig was still angry with <PER>Harry</PER> about the disasterous car journey and <PER>Ron</PER>’s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were planning to visit <PER>Hagrid</PER> on Saturday morning.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than <PER>Harry</PER> would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
“None of the other teams have started training yet; we’re going to be first off the mark this year — ” Yawning and shivering slightly, <PER>Harry</PER> climbed out of bed and tried to find <PER>Harry</PER>'s Quidditch robes.
“Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.” When he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, <PER>Harry</PER> scribbled a note to <PER>Ron</PER> explaining where he’d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder.
“It’ll be really boring,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly, but Colin ignored <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face shining with excitement.
“So,” said Wood, at long last, jerking <PER>Harry</PER> from a wistful fantasy about what <PER>Harry</PER> could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle.
As <PER>Harry</PER> walked onto the field, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sitting in the stands.
“Haven’t even started,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had brought out of the Great Hall.
“No idea,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took <PER>Harry</PER> as far away as possible from Colin.
It was <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Aren’t you <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s son?” said Fred, looking at <PER>Malfoy</PER> with dislike.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was smirking so broadly <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s cold eyes were reduced to slits.
“A field invasion.” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were crossing the grass to see what was going on.
“What’s happening?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, <PER>Weasley</PER>,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, smugly.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew at once that <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at <PER>Harry</PER>'s words.
Flint had to dive in front of <PER>Malfoy</PER> to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How dare you\”, and <PER>Ron</PER> plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one, <PER>Malfoy</PER>!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm at <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was on all fours, banging the ground with <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s fist.
“We’d better get him to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, it’s nearest,” said <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled <PER>Ron</PER> up by the arms.
“Can you hold his still, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Get out of the way, Colin!” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> supported <PER>Ron</PER> out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest.
“Nearly there, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> as the gamekeeper’s cabin came into view.
“You’ll be all right in a minute — almost there — ” They were within twenty feet of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house when the front door opened, but it wasn’t <PER>Hagrid</PER> who emerged.
“Quick, behind here,” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed, dragging <PER>Ron</PER> behind a nearby bush.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled <PER>Ron</PER> out of the bush and up to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s front door.
“Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me — come in, come in — thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again — ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> supported <PER>Ron</PER> over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> didn’t seem perturbed by <PER>Ron</PER>’s slug problem, which <PER>Harry</PER> hastily explained as he lowered <PER>Ron</PER> into a chair.
“Get ’em all up, <PER>Ron</PER>.” “I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it to stop,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously, watching <PER>Ron</PER> bend over the basin.
“What did Lockhart want with you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, scratching Fang’s ears.
“Who was he tryin’ ter curse?” “<PER>Malfoy</PER> called <PER>Hermione</PER> something — it must’ve been really bad, because everyone went wild.” “It was bad,” said <PER>Ron</PER> hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> called her ‘Mudblood,’ <PER>Hagrid</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER> dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance.
“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.
“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting <PER>Harry</PER> genially on the back and sending <PER>Harry</PER> face first into the table.
“Better not risk it.” “Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> finished the last of their tea.
In the small vegetable patch behind <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen.
“Well, I’ve bin givin’ they — you know — a bit o’ help <PER>Harry</PER> noticed <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin.
“Well, you’ve done a good job on them.” “That’s what yer little sister said,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, nodding at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Met her jus’ yesterday.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Harry</PER>, his beard twitching.
“Watch it!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> roared, pulling <PER>Ron</PER> away from his precious pumpkins.
It was nearly lunchtime and as <PER>Harry</PER> had only had one bit of treacle toffee since dawn, <PER>Harry</PER> was keen to go back to school to eat.
They said good-bye to <PER>Hagrid</PER> and walked back up to the castle, <PER>Ron</PER> hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.
“And no magic, <PER>Weasley</PER> — elbow grease.” <PER>Ron</PER> gulped.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t enjoy <PER>Harry</PER>'s shepherd’s pie as much as he’d thought.
<PER>Harry</PER> let Lockhart’s voice wash over Lockhart’s, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and “Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then Lockhart’s caught a phrase like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, <PER>Harry</PER>,” or “Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.” The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved <PER>Harry</PER>'s aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley’s address.
<PER>Harry</PER> was straining <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> mustn’t expect a treat like this every time <PER>Harry</PER> got detention.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas, got into bed, and waited.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> frowning in the moonlight.
<PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER>, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy.
As <PER>Harry</PER> squelched along the deserted corridor <PER>Harry</PER> came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as <PER>Harry</PER> was.
“Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly — ” The rest of <PER>Harry</PER>’s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near <PER>Harry</PER>'s ankles.
Fred and George <PER>Weasley</PER> had an entire drawer to Fred and George <PER>Weasley</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t much like Peeves, but couldn’t help feeling grateful for <PER>Harry</PER>'s timing.
With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn’t on his way back, <PER>Harry</PER> picked up the envelope and read: KWIKSPELL A Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic Intrigued, <PER>Harry</PER> flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just reading “Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)” when shuffling footsteps outside told <PER>Harry</PER> Filch was coming back.
“We’ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet — ” His eyes fell on <PER>Harry</PER> and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, <PER>Harry</PER> realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.
<PER>Harry</PER> braced <PER>Harry</PER> for a tidal wave of fury.
“If I thought you’d read my private — not that it’s mine — for a friend — be that as it may — however — <PER>Harry</PER> was staring at — <PER>Harry</PER>, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — would I be asking too much — but no, you wouldn’t want — ” “What is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Oh,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, not sure whether <PER>Harry</PER> should look sorry or happy about this.
“A deathday party?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> keenly when <PER>Harry</PER> had changed at last and joined <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER> in the common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> was at the point of telling <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room.
The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.
“A promise is a promise,” <PER>Hermione</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER> bossily.
“You said you’d go to the deathday party.” So at seven o’clock, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.
As <PER>Harry</PER> shivered and drew <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.
“Shall we have a look around?” <PER>Harry</PER> suggested, wanting to warm up <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON DIED 3 1 ST OCTOBER, 1 492 <PER>Harry</PER> watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth held wide so that <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth passed through one of the stinking salmon.
“I expect they’ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> knowledgeably, pinching <PER>Hermione</PER>'s nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.
“No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s looking?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, nudging <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> painfully in the ribs.
“Live ’uns!” said Sir Patrick, spotting <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter).
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’re you — ?” “It’s that voice again — shut up a minute — ” soo hungry for so long ” “Listen!” said <PER>Harry</PER> urgently, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> froze, watching him.
A mixture of fear and excitement gripped <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward?
<PER>Harry</PER> sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> clattering behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’re we — ” “SHH!” <PER>Harry</PER> strained <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what was that all about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, wiping sweat off his face.
As they edged nearer, <PER>Harry</PER> almost slipped — there was a large puddle of water on the floor; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “Let’s get out of here.” “Shouldn’t we try and help — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began awkwardly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight.
In seconds, he had swept past <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and detached Mistress Norris from the torch bracket.
Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; so did Professors McGonagall and <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching.
<PER>Snape</PER> loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though <PER>Snape</PER> was trying hard not to smile.
Much as he detested Filch, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help feeling a bit sorry for <PER>Harry</PER>, though not nearly as sorry as <PER>Harry</PER> felt for <PER>Harry</PER>.
If <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believed Filch, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would be expelled for sure.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was now muttering strange words under <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s breath and tapping Mistress Norris with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand but nothing happened: Mistress Norris continued to look as though Mistress Norris had been recently stuffed. "
“It would take Dark Magic of the most advanced — ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did it, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did it!” Filch spat, He's pouchy face purpling.
“I never touched Mistress Norris!” <PER>Harry</PER> said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, including all the Lockharts on the walls.
“He saw my Kwikspell letter!” “If I might speak, Headmaster,” said <PER>Snape</PER> from the shadows, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s sense of foreboding increased; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure nothing <PER>Snape</PER> had to say was going to do <PER>Harry</PER> any good.
“Why go up to that corridor?” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You may go,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> squinted at <PER>Harry</PER>'s friends’ darkened faces.
“Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.” Something in <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice made <PER>Harry</PER> ask, “You do believe me, don’t you?” “ ’Course I do,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quickly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER> scrubbing the message on the wall with Mistress Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone.
When Filch wasn’t guarding the scene of the crime, Filch was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put unsuspecting students in detention for things like “breathing loudly” and “looking happy.” <PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER> seemed very disturbed by Mistress Norris’s fate.
“Stuff like this doesn’t often happen at Hogwarts,” <PER>Ron</PER> assured <PER>Ginny</PER>.
It was quite usual for <PER>Hermione</PER> to spend a lot of time reading, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was now doing almost nothing else.
Nor could <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> get much response from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s when they asked what <PER>Hermione</PER> was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been held back in Potions, where <PER>Snape</PER> had made <PER>Harry</PER> stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks.
After a hurried lunch, <PER>Harry</PER> went upstairs to meet <PER>Ron</PER> in the library, and saw Justin Finch- Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming toward him.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of Justin, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER> at the back of the library, measuring <PER>Harry</PER>'s History of Magic homework.
“And <PER>Hermione</PER>’s done four feet seven inches and her writing’s tiny.” “Where is she?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling <PER>Harry</PER>'s own homework.
“All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,” She said, sitting down next to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“The same reason everyone else wants it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.” “What’s that?” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“And I can’t find the story anywhere else — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, let me read your composition,” said <PER>Ron</PER> desperately, checking his watch.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way to History of Magic, bickering.
<PER>Hermione</PER> put up <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
“Miss Grant?” “Please, sir, don’t legends always have a basis in fact?” Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure no student had ever interrupted <PER>Harry</PER> before, alive or dead.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Harry</PER> was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.
“I repeat, if the likes of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> “But maybe you’ve got to be related to Slytherin, so <PER>Dumbledore</PER> couldn’t — ” began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough.
“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin.
<PER>Harry</PER> could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear when <PER>Harry</PER>’d placed the hat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s head a year before: You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that .
“Hiya, <PER>Harry</PER>!” “Hullo, Colin,” said <PER>Harry</PER> automatically.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — a boy in my class has been saying you’re — ” But Colin was so small Colin couldn’t fight against the tide of people bearing Colin toward the Great Hall; they heard Colin squeak, “See you, <PER>Harry</PER>!” and Colin was gone.
“That I’m Slytherin’s heir, I expect,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach dropping another inch or so as <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run away from <PER>Harry</PER> at lunchtime.
“D’you really think there’s a Chamber of Secrets?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Can’t hurt to have a poke around,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, dropping <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and knees so that <PER>Harry</PER> could crawl along, searching for clues.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “have you, <PER>Ron</PER>?
“I never knew that,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking at <PER>Ron</PER> in surprise.
“Level with this door.” <PER>Harry</PER> reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d been burned.
“That’s a girls’ toilet.” “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, there won’t be anyone in there,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, standing up and coming over.
<PER>Hermione</PER> put <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lips and set off toward the end stall.
When <PER>Hermione</PER> reached it <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Hello, Myrtle, how are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went to look.
“This is a girls’ bathroom,” she said, eyeing <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> suspiciously.
“Ask Shis if She saw anything,” <PER>Harry</PER> mouthed at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stood with their mouths open, but <PER>Hermione</PER> shrugged wearily and said, “Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle.
“RON!” Percy <PER>Weasley</PER> had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on Percy <PER>Weasley</PER>'s face.
“Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!” “That’s what I told <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said Percy fiercely, “but she still seems to think you’re going to be expelled, I’ve never seen shis so upset, crying shis eyes out, you might think of she, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business — ” “ You don’t care about <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose ears were now reddening.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s surprise, <PER>Hermione</PER> followed suit.
“If you’re talking about <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ” “Of course I am!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You heard him — ‘You’ll be next, MudbloodsV — come on, you’ve only got to look at him's foul rat face to know it’s him — ” “<PER>Malfoy</PER>, the Heir of Slytherin?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> skeptically.
“Look at his family,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s books, too.
“There might be a way,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> slowly, dropping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy.
“What we’d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask <PER>Malfoy</PER> a few questions without <PER>Malfoy</PER> realizing it’s us.” “But that’s impossible,” <PER>Harry</PER> said as <PER>Ron</PER> laughed.
“All we’d need would be some Polyjuice Potion.” “What’s that?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> together.
“<PER>Snape</PER> mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — ” “D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to <PER>Snape</PER>?” muttered <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?” “It wears off after a while,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, waving <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand impatiently.
“Hard to see why we’d want the book, really,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “if we weren’t going to try and make one of the potions.” “I think,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance.
he usually picked <PER>Harry</PER> to help <PER>Harry</PER> with these reconstructions; so far, <PER>Harry</PER> had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with <PER>Harry</PER>.
If <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, <PER>Harry</PER> would have refused to do it.
“Nice loud howl, <PER>Harry</PER> — exactly — and then, if you’ll believe it, I pounced — like this — slammed <PER>Harry</PER> to the floor — thus — with one hand, I managed to hold <PER>Harry</PER> down — with my other, I put my wand to <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat — I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm — <PER>Harry</PER> let out a piteous moan — go on, <PER>Harry</PER> — higher than that — good — the fur vanished — the fangs shrank — and <PER>Harry</PER> turned back into a man.
<PER>Harry</PER> returned to the back of the room, where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waiting.
“All right ” <PER>Hermione</PER> approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> right behind her.
“But the thing is, it’s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it — I’m sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms — ” “Ah, Gadding with GhoulsV’ said Lockhart, taking the note from <PER>Hermione</PER> and smiling widely at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lockhart, while <PER>Hermione</PER> folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag.
“Moste Potente Potions?” she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from <PER>Hermione</PER>; but <PER>Hermione</PER> wouldn’t let go.
<PER>Hermione</PER> put it carefully into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had overridden <PER>Ron</PER>’s objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy.
Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s stall, but they were ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> they.
“Here it is,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> excitedly as <PER>Hermione</PER> found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion.
“Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,” <PER>Hermione</PER> murmured, running <PER>Hermione</PER>'s finger down the list of ingredients.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> could have attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!” But <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and “<PER>Malfoy</PER> added swiftly, “But it’s the best plan we’ve got, so full steam ahead, I say.” However, while <PER>Hermione</PER> was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, “It’ll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock <PER>Malfoy</PER> off his broom tomorrow.” <PER>Harry</PER> woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match.
After half an hour of lying there with <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides churning, <PER>Harry</PER> got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where <PER>Harry</PER> found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> came hurrying over to wish <PER>Harry</PER> good luck as <PER>Harry</PER> entered the locker rooms.
“I haven’t been properly dry since August”) “ — and we’re going to make them rue the day them let that little bit of slime, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, buy his way onto their team.” Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’ll be down to you, <PER>Harry</PER>, to show you, <PER>Harry</PER> that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father.
“All right there, Scarhead?” yelled <PER>Malfoy</PER>, shooting underneath <PER>Harry</PER> as though to show off the speed of <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for <PER>Harry</PER> again.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the Bludger whistling along behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, but Fred was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to <PER>Harry</PER>, the Bludger pelted after him once more and <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to fly off at full speed.
It had started to rain; <PER>Harry</PER> felt heavy drops fall onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, splattering onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until <PER>Harry</PER> heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, “Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero — ” The Slytherins’ superior brooms were clearly doing ’ superior brooms's jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock <PER>Harry</PER> out of the air.
Fred and George were now flying so close to <PER>Harry</PER> on either side that <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.
Over Madam Hooch's shoulder, <PER>Harry</PER> could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s direction.
“It’ll take your head off.” Wood was looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to the <PER>Weasley</PER>s.
“You can’t let <PER>Harry</PER> deal with that thing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
On Madam Hooch’s whistle, <PER>Harry</PER> kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
Higher and higher <PER>Harry</PER> climbed; <PER>Harry</PER> looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled.
Slightly dizzy, <PER>Harry</PER> nevertheless kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes wide open, rain was speckling <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses and ran up <PER>Harry</PER>'s nostrils as <PER>Harry</PER> hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear laughter from the crowd; <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> must look very stupid, but the Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change direction as quickly as <PER>Harry</PER> could; <PER>Harry</PER> began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood — A whistling in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear told <PER>Harry</PER> the Bludger had just missed <PER>Harry</PER> again; <PER>Harry</PER> turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.
“Training for the ballet, Potter?” yelled <PER>Malfoy</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at <PER>Malfoy</PER> in hatred, him saw the Bludger — the Golden Snitch.
It was hovering inches above <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s left ear — and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, busy laughing at <PER>Harry</PER>, hadn’t seen it.
For an agonizing moment, <PER>Harry</PER> hung in midair, not daring to speed toward <PER>Malfoy</PER> in case <PER>Harry</PER> looked up and saw the Snitch.
The Bludger had hit The Bludger at last, smashed into The Bludger's elbow, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm break.
Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, his slid sideways on his rain- drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side — The Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time aiming at his face — <PER>Harry</PER> swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in — <PER>Harry</PER>'s numb brain: get to <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Through a haze of rain and pain — <PER>Harry</PER> dived for the shimmering, sneering face below <PER>Harry</PER> and saw its eyes widen with fear: <PER>Malfoy</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was attacking <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What the — ” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, careening out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s way.
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s remaining hand off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom and made a wild snatch; <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as <PER>Harry</PER> headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out.
“<PER>Harry</PER> should really, Professor,” said a muddy Wood, who couldn’t help grinning even though <PER>Harry</PER>'s Seeker was injured.
“Great capture, <PER>Harry</PER>, really spectacular, your best yet, I’d say — ” Through the thicket of legs around him, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted Fred and George <PER>Weasley</PER>, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box.
“No — don’t — ” said <PER>Harry</PER> weakly, but Lockhart was twirling <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and a second later had directed it straight at <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
A strange and unpleasant sensation started at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder and spread all the way down to <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingertips.
“How can you stick up for Lockhart now, <PER>Hermione</PER>, eh?” <PER>Ron</PER> called through the curtain as he pulled <PER>Harry</PER>’s limp fingers through the cuff.
“If <PER>Harry</PER> had wanted deboning <PER>Harry</PER> would have asked.” “Anyone can make a mistake,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And it doesn’t hurt anymore, does it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, getting into bed.
Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to help <PER>Harry</PER> gulp down some water.
Hours and hours later, <PER>Harry</PER> woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: <PER>Harry</PER> arm now felt full of large splinters.
For a second, <PER>Harry</PER> thought that was what had woken <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then, with a thrill of horror, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that someone was sponging <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead in the dark.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter came back to school,” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter whispered miserably.
“Dobby hid and watched for <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward” — he showed <PER>Harry</PER> ten long, bandaged fingers — “but Dobby didn’t care, sir, for he thought <PER>Harry</PER> Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter would get to school another way!” he was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.
“You nearly got <PER>Ron</PER> and me expelled,” <PER>Ron</PER> and me said fiercely.
“Dark deeds are planned in this place, but <PER>Harry</PER> Potter must not be here when they happen — go home, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, go home.
“Go home, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, go home!” “I’m not going anywhere!” said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely.
“One of my best friends is Muggle-born; she’ll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened — ” “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter risks “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter's own life for “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter's friends!” moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s slumped back into bed, <PER>Harry</PER>’s's eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer.
“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed out of sight.
Slowly and carefully, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER> a few inches so <PER>Harry</PER> could look at the statue on the bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm reboned but very stiff.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat up quickly and looked over at Colin’s bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains <PER>Harry</PER> had changed behind yesterday.
“When you’ve finished eating, you may leave.” <PER>Harry</PER> dressed as quickly as <PER>Harry</PER> could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about Colin and Dobby, but they weren’t there.
<PER>Harry</PER> left to look for they, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren’t interested in whether <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s bones back or not.
As <PER>Harry</PER> passed the library, Percy <PER>Weasley</PER> strolled out of it, looking in far better spirits than last time they’d met.
“I hope <PER>Ron</PER>’s not in another girls’ toilet ” <PER>Harry</PER> forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Percy couldn’t see why <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, Percy opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall.
“We ’d’ve come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,” <PER>Ron</PER> explained as <PER>Harry</PER>, with difficulty, locked the stall again.
“We’ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.” <PER>Harry</PER> started to tell them about Colin, but <PER>Hermione</PER> interrupted.
“Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up, amazed.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> listened with their mouths open.
“<PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> must’ve opened the Chamber when “<PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> must’ve was at school here and now “<PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> must’ve’s told dear old <PER>Draco</PER> how to do it.
“Or maybe it can disguise it — pretend to be a suit of armor or something — I’ve read about Chameleon Ghouls — ” “You read too much, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches.
<PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER>, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up.
They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told They he was going to write to Mistress <PER>Weasley</PER> and tell her <PER>Ginny</PER> was having nightmares.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> signed her list; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had heard that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was staying, which struck them as very suspicious.
<PER>Harry</PER> privately felt <PER>Harry</PER>’d rather face Slytherin’s legendary monster than let <PER>Snape</PER> catch him robbing him's office.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was <PER>Snape</PER>’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say “Unfair.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but <PER>Harry</PER>’s Swelling Solution had <PER>Harry</PER>’s Swelling Solution's mind on more important things.
He was waiting for <PER>Hermione</PER>’s signal, and He hardly listened as <PER>Snape</PER> paused to sneer at <PER>Snape</PER>'s watery potion.
When <PER>Snape</PER> turned and walked off to bully <PER>Neville</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and nodded.
<PER>Harry</PER> ducked swiftly down behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron, pulled one of Fred’s Filibuster fireworks out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> got a faceful and <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hands over <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate — <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened.
Through the confusion, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> slip quietly into <PER>Snape</PER>’s office.
“Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draught — when I find out who did this — ” <PER>Harry</PER> tried not to laugh as <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> hurry forward, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon.
As half the class lumbered up to <PER>Snape</PER> ’s desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed- up lips, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> slide back into the dungeon, the front of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes bulging.
“If I ever find out who threw this,” <PER>Snape</PER> whispered, “I shall make sure that person is expelled.” <PER>Harry</PER> arranged his face into what <PER>Harry</PER> hoped was a puzzled expression.
<PER>Snape</PER> was looking right at <PER>Snape</PER>, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome.
“He knew it was me,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
“<PER>Snape</PER> can’t prove it was you,” said <PER>Ron</PER> reassuringly to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What can <PER>Snape</PER> do?” “Knowing <PER>Snape</PER>, something foul,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as the potion frothed and bubbled.
A week later, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were walking across the entrance hall when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up.
“Could be useful,” he said to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> went into dinner.
“Shall we go?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were all for it, so at eight o’clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall.
“Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young — maybe it’ll be he.” “As long as it’s not — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but <PER>Harry</PER> ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than <PER>Snape</PER>, wearing his usual black.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why Lockhart was still smiling; if <PER>Snape</PER> had been looking at <PER>Harry</PER> like that <PER>Harry</PER>’d have been running as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could in the opposite direction.
Lockhart and <PER>Snape</PER> turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of Lockhart's hands, whereas <PER>Snape</PER> jerked his head irritably.
Then Lockhart and <PER>Snape</PER> raised Lockhart and <PER>Snape</PER>'s wands like swords in front of Lockhart and <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Who cares?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
Lockhart teamed <PER>Neville</PER> with Justin Finch- Fletchley, but <PER>Snape</PER> reached <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> first.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Hermione</PER>'s a weak smile that <PER>Hermione</PER> did not return.
“And bow!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> barely inclined their heads, not taking <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes off each other.
“When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents — only to disarm your opponents — we don’t want any accidents — one two three — ” <PER>Harry</PER> swung his wand high, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> had already started on “two”: His spell hit <PER>Harry</PER> so hard <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d been hit over the head with a saucepan.
<PER>Harry</PER> stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand straight at <PER>Malfoy</PER> and shouted, “Rictusempral” A jet of silver light hit <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the stomach and <PER>Harry</PER> doubled up, wheezing.
“I said disarm only\” Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as <PER>Malfoy</PER> sank to his knees; <PER>Harry</PER> had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and <PER>Harry</PER> could barely move for laughing.
<PER>Harry</PER> hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch <PER>Malfoy</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER> was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, <PER>Malfoy</PER> pointed his wand at <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees, choked, “Tarantallegral” and the next second <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs began to jerk around out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s control in a kind of quickstep.
“Finite Incantatem\” he shouted; <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet stopped dancing, <PER>Malfoy</PER> stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.
Both <PER>Neville</PER> and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; <PER>Ron</PER> was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but <PER>Hermione</PER> and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving; Millicent had <PER>Hermione</PER> in a headlock and <PER>Hermione</PER> was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor.
“How about <PER>Malfoy</PER> and Potter?” said <PER>Snape</PER> with a twisted smile.
“Excellent idea!” said Lockhart, gesturing <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> room.
<PER>Snape</PER> smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, “Whoops — my wand is a little overexcited — ” <PER>Snape</PER> moved closer to <PER>Malfoy</PER>, bent down, and whispered something in his ear.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, “Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?” “Scared?” muttered <PER>Malfoy</PER>, so that Lockhart couldn’t hear Lockhart.
“You wish,” said <PER>Harry</PER> out of the corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> raised <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand quickly and bellowed, “ Serpensortial” The end of his wand exploded.
“Don’t move, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of <PER>Harry</PER> standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure what made <PER>Harry</PER> do it.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs were carrying him forward as though him was on casters and that him had shouted stupidly at the snake, “Leave him alone!” And miraculously — inexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, the snake eyes now on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt the fear drain out of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew the snake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how <PER>Harry</PER> knew the snake, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t have explained.
“What do you think you’re playing at?” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.
<PER>Snape</PER> stepped forward, waved <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke.
<PER>Snape</PER>, too, was looking at <PER>Harry</PER> in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like it.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> felt a tugging on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Move — come on—” <PER>Ron</PER> steered him out of the hall, <PER>Hermione</PER> hurrying alongside them.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have a clue what was going on, and neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER> into an armchair and said, “You’re a Parselmouth.
Through a gap in the curtains around <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster <PER>Harry</PER> watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered Could <PER>Harry</PER> be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin?
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know anything about <PER>Harry</PER>'s father’s family, after all.
<PER>Harry</PER> fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> used their time off to play a game of wizard chess.
“For heaven’s sake, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, exasperated, as one of <PER>Ron</PER>’s bishops wrestled <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knight off his horse and dragged him off the board.
Resisting the urge to take a look, <PER>Harry</PER> walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using <PER>Harry</PER>'s free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first.
<PER>Harry</PER> was walking toward them when something of what them were saying met <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears, and <PER>Harry</PER> paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section.
“All I saw,” said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, “was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.” “I didn’t chase it at him!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice shaking with anger.
<PER>Harry</PER> blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where <PER>Harry</PER> was going, <PER>Harry</PER> was in such a fury.
The result was that <PER>Harry</PER> walked into something very large and solid, which knocked <PER>Harry</PER> backward onto the floor.
“Oh, hello, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking up.
“It’s either foxes or a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, an’ I need the headmaster’s permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.” He peered more closely at <PER>Harry</PER> from under <PER>Harry</PER>'s thick, snow-flecked eyebrows.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, <PER>Harry</PER>'s breathing fast and shallow, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart doing a kind of drumroll against <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs.
he flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>, screamed, “ATTACK!
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew now where <PER>Harry</PER> was being taken.
Professor McGonagall told <PER>Harry</PER> to wait and left <PER>Harry</PER> there, alone.
One thing was certain: of all the teachers’ offices <PER>Harry</PER> had visited so far this year, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s was by far the most interesting.
If <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s hadn’t been scared out of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s's wits that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s was about to be thrown out of school, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it.
Then a small voice said in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear, “Bee in your bonnet, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” “Er, yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
Then a strange, gagging noise behind <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER> wheel around.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as <PER>Harry</PER> watched, a couple more feathers fell out of Its tail.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just thinking that all <PER>Harry</PER> needed was for <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s pet bird to die while <PER>Harry</PER> was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.
“Your bird — I couldn’t do anything — he just caught fire — ” To <PER>Harry</PER>’s astonishment, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled.
Before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and <PER>Hagrid</PER> burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.
“It wasn’ <PER>Harry</PER>, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> urgently.
“I was talkin’ ter him seconds before that kid was found, him never had time, sir — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tried to say something, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> went ranting on, waving the rooster around in sir —'s agitation, sending feathers everywhere.
“ — it can’t’ve bin him, I’ll swear it in front o’ the Ministry o’ Magic if I have to — ” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, I — ” “ — yeh’ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know <PER>Harry</PER> never “<PER>Hagrid</PER>l” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> loudly.
“I do not think that <PER>Harry</PER> attacked those people.” “Oh,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the rooster falling limply at his side.
“You don’t think it was me, Professor?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated hopefully as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> brushed rooster feathers off his desk.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, though <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was somber again.
“But I still want to talk to you.” <PER>Harry</PER> waited nervously while <PER>Dumbledore</PER> considered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long fingers together.
“I must ask you, <PER>Harry</PER>, whether there is anything you’d like to tell me,” <PER>Harry</PER> said gently.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of <PER>Malfoy</PER> shouting, “You’ll be next, Mudbloods!” and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> thought of the disembodied voice <PER>Harry</PER> had heard twice and remembered what <PER>Ron</PER> had said: “ Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.” he thought, too, about what everyone was saying about he, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin.
“At this rate, well be the only ones left,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was tired of people skirting around <PER>Harry</PER> in the corridors, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as <PER>Harry</PER> passed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s in a hurry.” “Yeah, <PER>Harry</PER>’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with <PER>Harry</PER>'s fanged servant,” said George, chortling.
“Oh, don’t,” she wailed every time Fred asked <PER>Harry</PER> loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward <PER>Harry</PER> off with a large clove of garlic when they met.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t mind; it made <PER>Harry</PER> feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of <PER>Harry</PER>'s being Slytherin ’s heir was quite ludicrous.
But their antics seemed to be aggravating <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.
<PER>Harry</PER> found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the <PER>Weasley</PER>s had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by <PER>Hermione</PER>, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> — you’re not supposed to be in here — ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shielding his eyes against the light.
“Are you sure?” “Positive,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shirting Scabbers the rat so that <PER>Hermione</PER> could sit down on the end of <PER>Ron</PER>’s four- poster.
“Hello,” said <PER>Harry</PER> happily as she landed on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
They had sent <PER>Harry</PER> a toothpick and a note telling <PER>Harry</PER> to find out whether <PER>Harry</PER>’d be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had sent him a large tin of treacle toffee, which <PER>Harry</PER> decided to soften by the fire before eating; <PER>Ron</PER> had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill.
<PER>Harry</PER> read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mister <PER>Weasley</PER>’s car (which hadn’t been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule- breaking he and <PER>Ron</PER> were planning next.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> led them in a few of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s favorite carols, <PER>Hagrid</PER> booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t even care that <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was making loud, snide remarks about <PER>Harry</PER>'s new sweater from the Slytherin table.
With a bit of luck, <PER>Malfoy</PER> would be getting <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s comeuppance in a few hours’ time.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when <PER>Hermione</PER> ushered their out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.
“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing into,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> matter-of-factly, as though <PER>Hermione</PER> were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent.
“And obviously, it’ll be best if you can get something of Crabbe’s and Goyle’s; they’re <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s best friends, he’ll tell <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s best friends anything.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I don’t think — ” “That could go seriously wrong — ” But <PER>Hermione</PER> had a steely glint in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had.
“You do want to investigate <PER>Malfoy</PER>, don’t you?” “Oh, all right, all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?” But to <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as <PER>Hermione</PER> had said.
When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.
Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, <PER>Harry</PER> yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle ’s forehead and <PER>Ron</PER> pulled out several of Crabbe ’s hairs.
Pulling their robes up over their faces, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> knocked softly on the door.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>?” They heard the scrape of the lock and <PER>Hermione</PER> emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious.
Then, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand trembling, <PER>Hermione</PER> shook Millicent Bulstrode’s hair out of its bottle into the first glass.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and <PER>Ron</PER> put Crabbe’s into the last one.
“Hang on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> reached for their glasses.
“Ready,” came <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voices.
With difficulty, <PER>Harry</PER> kicked off <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoes and stood up.
<PER>Harry</PER> unlocked <PER>Harry</PER>'s door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror.
<PER>Harry</PER> scratched <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear.
“That’s how he looks every time a teacher asks he a question.” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, are you okay?” said <PER>Harry</PER> through the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off.
“Don’t swing your arms like that,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe’s and Goyle’s huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn’t going to be as easy as they had hoped.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was strolling toward them, and for the first time in <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s life, <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“And what’re you doing down here, <PER>Weasley</PER>?” <PER>Weasley</PER>?
“I don’t like your attitude!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> sneered and motioned for <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to follow him.
He and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried after <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who said as they turned into the next passage, “That Peter <PER>Weasley</PER> — ” “Percy,” <PER>Ron</PER> corrected him automatically.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged excited looks.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> marched through it, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed him.
“Wait here,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire.
“I’ll go and get it — my father’s just sent it to me — ” Wondering what <PER>Malfoy</PER> was going to show them, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down, doing them's best to look at home.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> thrust it under <PER>Ron</PER>’s nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER>'s eyes widen in shock.
<PER>Harry</PER> read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and handed the clipping to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Mister <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mister <PER>Weasley</PER>’s resignation.
“<PER>Weasley</PER> has brought the Ministry into disrepute,” Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> told our reporter.
“Well?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> impatiently as <PER>Harry</PER> handed the clipping back to him.
“Arthur <PER>Weasley</PER> loves Muggles so much Arthur <PER>Weasley</PER> should snap Arthur <PER>Weasley</PER>'s wand in half and go and join them,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> scornfully.
“You’d never know the <PER>Weasley</PER>s were purebloods, the way they behave.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s — or rather, Crabbe’s — face was contorted with fury.
“What’s the matter with you two?” Far too late, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> forced themselves to laugh, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake.
Fortunately, <PER>Malfoy</PER> didn’t notice, and <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking fast, said, “You must have some idea who’s behind it all.
Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if <PER>Ron</PER> punched <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> shot him a warning look and said, “D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?” “Oh, yeah whoever it was was expelled,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
his nose was also slowly lengthening — their hour was up, <PER>Ron</PER> was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror himself was suddenly giving <PER>Harry</PER>, himself must be, too.
“Medicine for my stomach,” <PER>Ron</PER> grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that <PER>Malfoy</PER> hadn’t noticed anything.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet slipping around in Goyle’s huge shoes and had to hoist up <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes as <PER>Harry</PER> shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they’d locked Crabbe and Goyle.
“I know we still haven’t found out who’s doing the attacks, but I’m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’ drawing room.” <PER>Harry</PER> checked him's face in the cracked mirror.
him put him's glasses on as <PER>Ron</PER> hammered on the door of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s stall.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you — ” “Go away!” <PER>Hermione</PER> squeaked.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at each other.
“It’s awful — ” They heard the lock slide back and <PER>Hermione</PER> emerged, sobbing, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes pulled up over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
“Have you still got Millicent’s nose or something?” <PER>Hermione</PER> let <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes fall and <PER>Ron</PER> backed into the sink.
“It’s okay, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bed, to spare <PER>Hermione</PER>'s the shame of being seen with a furry face.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went to visit her every evening.
“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, tipping a stack of books onto <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bedside table one evening.
“Don’t be silly, <PER>Ron</PER>, I’ve got to keep up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face and Her's eyes were turning slowly back to brown.
“I was so sure it was <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, for about the hundredth time.
“What’s that?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing to something gold sticking out from under <PER>Hermione</PER>’s pillow.
“Just a get well card,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but <PER>Ron</PER> was too quick for <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud: “To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award.” <PER>Ron</PER> looked up at <PER>Hermione</PER>, disgusted.
“You sleep with this under your pillow?” But <PER>Hermione</PER> was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s evening dose of medicine.
“Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you’ve ever met, or what?” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER> as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower.
<PER>Snape</PER> had given them so much homework, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was likely to be in the sixth year before <PER>Harry</PER> finished it.
<PER>Ron</PER> was just saying <PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had asked <PER>Hermione</PER> how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a Hair-Raising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears.
<PER>Harry</PER> stepped forward to pick It up, but <PER>Ron</PER> suddenly flung out an arm to hold <PER>Harry</PER> back.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told <PER>Harry</PER> it was fifty years old.
“Hang on,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had approached cautiously and was looking over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, <PER>Harry</PER> showed her T. M. <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary and told her the story of how they had found it.
“I wouldn’t mind knowing how <PER>Riddle</PER> got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.” “Could’ve been anything,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“That’s what <PER>Malfoy</PER> said.” “Yeah ” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly.
“So?” “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>, wake up,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Undaunted, <PER>Hermione</PER> shoved <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand back into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.
“<PER>Riddle</PER> just got a diary for Christmas and couldn’t be bothered filling a diary for Christmas in.” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t explain, even to <PER>Harry</PER>, why <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t just throw <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary away.
The fact was that even though <PER>Harry</PER> knew the diary was blank, <PER>Harry</PER> kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to finish.
And while <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard the name T. M. <PER>Riddle</PER> before, it still seemed to mean something to <PER>Harry</PER>, almost as though <PER>Riddle</PER> was a friend he’d had when he was very small, and had half-forgotten.
Nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER> was determined to find out more about <PER>Riddle</PER>, so next day at break, <PER>Harry</PER> headed for the trophy room to examine <PER>Riddle</PER>’s special award, accompanied by an interested <PER>Hermione</PER> and a thoroughly unconvinced <PER>Ron</PER>, who told them <PER>Harry</PER>’d seen enough of the trophy room to <PER>Harry</PER> a lifetime.
<PER>Riddle</PER>’s burnished gold shield didn’t carry details of why it had been given to him (“Good thing, too, or it’d be even bigger and I’d still be polishing it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>).
<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch practice the night before, and <PER>Harry</PER> hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late.
<PER>Harry</PER> went over to the Gryffindor table, where <PER>Ron</PER> was sitting looking sickened, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have been overcome with giggles.
“What’s going on?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off <PER>Harry</PER>'s bacon.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked as though someone had just fed <PER>Snape</PER> a large beaker of Skele-Gro.
“Please, <PER>Hermione</PER>, tell me you weren’t one of the forty-six,” said <PER>Ron</PER> as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson.
<PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly became very interested in searching <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag for <PER>Hermione</PER>'s schedule and didn’t answer.
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include <PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to escape.
“Stay stilll” grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bag and pulling <PER>Harry</PER> back.
“What’s going on here?” came the cold, drawling voice of <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> started stuffing everything feverishly into <PER>Harry</PER>'s ripped bag, desperate to get away before <PER>Malfoy</PER> could hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s musical valentine.
Losing his head, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized <PER>Harry</PER> around the knees and brought <PER>Harry</PER> crashing to the floor.
Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, His got up, His's feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy <PER>Weasley</PER> did Percy <PER>Weasley</PER>'s best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.
“And you, <PER>Malfoy</PER> — ” <PER>Harry</PER>, glancing over, saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> stoop and snatch up something.
Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER>’d got <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary.
“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who obviously hadn’t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had <PER>Harry</PER>’s own diary.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was staring from the diary to <PER>Harry</PER>, looking terrified.
“When I’ve had a look,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, waving the diary tauntingly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Percy said, “As a school prefect — ” but <PER>Harry</PER> had lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and shouted, “ ExpelliarmusV’ and just as <PER>Snape</PER> had disarmed Lockhart, so <PER>Malfoy</PER> found the diary shooting out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand into the air.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was looking furious, and as <PER>Ginny</PER> passed him to enter her classroom, him yelled spitefully after her, “I don’t think Potter liked your valentine much!” <PER>Ginny</PER> covered her face with her hands and ran into class.
Snarling, <PER>Ron</PER> pulled out his wand, too, but <PER>Harry</PER> pulled him away.
It wasn’t until they had reached Professor Flitwick’s class that <PER>Harry</PER> noticed something rather odd about <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary.
He tried to point this out to <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and He wasn’t much interested in anything else.
Jc Jc Jc <PER>Harry</PER> went to bed before anyone else in Jc Jc Jc <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory that night.
This was partly because he didn’t think he could stand Fred and George singing, “he eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad” one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary again, and knew that <PER>Ron</PER> thought he was wasting his time.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it.
Excited, <PER>Harry</PER> loaded up <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill a second time and wrote, “My name is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace.
<PER>Riddle</PER>’s reply came quickly, <PER>Riddle</PER>’s's writing becoming untidier, as though <PER>Riddle</PER>’s was hurrying to tell all <PER>Riddle</PER>’s knew.
<PER>Harry</PER> hands trembling slightly, <PER>Harry</PER> raised the book to press <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye against the little window, and before <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was happening, <PER>Harry</PER> was tilting forward; the window was widening, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s body leave <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, and <PER>Harry</PER> was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around <PER>Harry</PER> came suddenly into focus.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew immediately where <PER>Harry</PER> was.
This circular room with the sleeping portraits was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office — but it wasn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> who was sitting behind the desk.
Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past <PER>Harry</PER> without glancing at <PER>Harry</PER>, and went to draw the curtains at <PER>Harry</PER>'s window.
This was Hogwarts as <PER>Riddle</PER> had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster, not <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.
“<PER>Riddle</PER>, do you mean you know something about these attacks?” “No, sir,” said <PER>Riddle</PER> quickly.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was sure it was the same sort of “no” that he himself had given <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Riddle</PER> stopped, and so did <PER>Harry</PER>, watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Riddle</PER> was doing some serious thinking.
<PER>Harry</PER> was biting <PER>Harry</PER>'s lip, <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead furrowed.
Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, <PER>Harry</PER> gliding noiselessly behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was none other than a fifty-year-younger <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Well, hurry off to bed,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, giving <PER>Riddle</PER> exactly the kind of penetrating stare <PER>Harry</PER> knew so well.
<PER>Riddle</PER> watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with <PER>Harry</PER> in hot pursuit.
But to <PER>Harry</PER>’s disappointment, <PER>Riddle</PER> led <PER>Harry</PER> not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which <PER>Harry</PER> had Potions with <PER>Snape</PER>.
The torches hadn’t been lit, and when <PER>Riddle</PER> pushed the door almost closed, <PER>Harry</PER> could only just see <PER>Harry</PER>, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.
All <PER>Harry</PER> could see was the figure of <PER>Riddle</PER> at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue.
And just when All <PER>Harry</PER> had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing All <PER>Harry</PER> could return to the present, All <PER>Harry</PER> heard something move beyond the door.
<PER>Riddle</PER>, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, <PER>Harry</PER> tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t be heard.
And out of it came something that made <PER>Harry</PER> let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone — A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers — <PER>Riddle</PER> raised his wand again, but he was too late.
<PER>Riddle</PER> scrambled to his feet, looking after it; his raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on the huge boy, seized the huge boy's wand, and threw the huge boy back down, yelling, “NOOOOOOO!” The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> falling and, with a crash, <PER>Harry</PER> landed spread-eagled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary lying open on his stomach.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> had had time to regain <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, the dormitory door opened and <PER>Ron</PER> came in.
“What’s up?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking at <PER>Harry</PER> with concern.
“It was <PER>Hagrid</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>.
During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d christened “Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, <PER>Hagrid</PER> had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER>’d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of <PER>Harry</PER>’d.
<PER>Harry</PER>’d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; <PER>Harry</PER> could just imagine the thirteen-year-old <PER>Hagrid</PER> trying to fit a leash and collar on it.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was equally certain that <PER>Hagrid</PER> would never have meant to kill anybody.
<PER>Harry</PER> half wished <PER>Harry</PER> half hadn’t found out how to work <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary.
Again and again <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> made him recount what he’d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.
“<PER>Riddle</PER> might have got the wrong person,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“We always knew <PER>Hagrid</PER> had been expelled,” said <PER>Harry</PER> miserably.
“<PER>Riddle</PER> does sound like Percy — who asked him to squeal on <PER>Hagrid</PER>, anyway?” “But the monster had killed someone, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And “<PER>Riddle</PER> was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Do you think we should go and ask <PER>Hagrid</PER> about it all?” “That’d be a cheerful visit,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It could affect our whole future,” she told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking they with checks.
“I haven’t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.” <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom's family, all giving <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom different advice on what to choose.
Dean Thomas, who, like <PER>Harry</PER>, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and jabbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on.
<PER>Harry</PER> smiled grimly to <PER>Harry</PER> at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if <PER>Harry</PER> tried to discuss <PER>Harry</PER>'s career in wizardry with them.
Not that he didn’t get any guidance: Percy <PER>Weasley</PER> was eager to share Percy <PER>Weasley</PER>'s experience.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — I don’t know who did it — I just found — ” Watching <PER>Harry</PER> fearfully, <PER>Neville</PER> pushed open the door.
As he and <PER>Neville</PER> pulled the blankets back onto his bed, <PER>Ron</PER>, Dean, and Seamus came in.
“What happened, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “No idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
But <PER>Ron</PER> was examining <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes.
“Is there anything missing?” <PER>Harry</PER> started to pick up all <PER>Harry</PER>'s things and throw them into <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk.
“<PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary’s gone,” he said in an undertone to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What?” <PER>Harry</PER> jerked his head toward the dormitory door and <PER>Ron</PER> followed him out.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.” <PER>Harry</PER> had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary was right in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had been urging <PER>Harry</PER> to report the robbery, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like the idea.
As He left the Great Hall with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to <PER>Harry</PER>’s growing list.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just set foot on the marble staircase when <PER>Harry</PER> heard it yet again — “ Kill this time let me rip tear ” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted aloud and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both jumped away from <PER>Harry</PER> in alarm.
“The voice!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, clapped a hand to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s forehead.
“But why’s she got to go to the library?” “Because that’s what <PER>Hermione</PER> does,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shrugging.
“When in doubt, go to the library.” <PER>Harry</PER> stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind <PER>Harry</PER>, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on people's way to the Quidditch pitch.
“It’s nearly eleven — the match — ” <PER>Harry</PER> raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected <PER>Harry</PER>'s Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as his pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game.
<PER>Harry</PER> was just mounting <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase.
And on the bed next to her was — “<PER>Hermione</PER>Y’ <PER>Ron</PER> groaned.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> shook their heads, both staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Percy <PER>Weasley</PER> was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once Percy <PER>Weasley</PER> didn’t seem keen to make Percy <PER>Weasley</PER>'s views heard.
Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> had turned <PER>Hagrid</PER> in because Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed.
<PER>Harry</PER> now knew exactly how <PER>Harry</PER> had felt.
“What’re we going to do?” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
“D’you think they suspect <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “We’ve got to go and talk to him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making up <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
“I can’t believe it’s <PER>Harry</PER> this time, but if <PER>Harry</PER> set the monster loose last time him’ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.” “But McGonagall said we’ve got to stay in we tower unless we’re in class — ” “I think,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, more quietly still, “it’s time to get my dad’s old cloak out again.” <PER>Harry</PER> had inherited just one thing from <PER>Harry</PER>'s father: a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak.
Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when <PER>Ron</PER> stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where <PER>Snape</PER> stood standing guard.
Thankfully, <PER>Snape</PER> sneezed at almost exactly the moment <PER>Ron</PER> swore.
They hurried toward the lit windows of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s house and pulled off the cloak only when They were right outside <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s's front door.
“Did you hear about <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, a slight break in his voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged panic-stricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner.
“Good evening, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.” It was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge, the Minister of Magic!” <PER>Harry</PER> elbowed <PER>Ron</PER> hard to make him shut up.
He dropped into one of He's chairs and looked from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge.
“You know I never, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sir — ” “I want it understood, <PER>Cornelius</PER>, that <PER>Hagrid</PER> has my full confidence,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, frowning at Fudge.
It was <PER>Harry</PER>’s turn for an elbow in the ribs; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d let out an audible gasp.
Mister <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> strode into <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile.
“Get outta my house!” “My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your — er — d’you call this a house?” said <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, sneering as he looked around the small cabin.
“I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.” “And what exactly did you want with me, <PER>Lucius</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Lucius</PER> spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in <PER>Lucius</PER>'s blue eyes.
“ Dreadful thing, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, “but the governors feel it’s time for you to step aside.
“And as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has failed to stop these attacks — ” “See here, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> can’t stop them,” said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, “I mean to say, who can?” “That remains to be seen,” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> with a nasty smile.
“Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
He looked at <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not taken <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s bright blue eyes off <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s cold gray ones.
Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for <PER>Hagrid</PER> to go ahead of his, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said carefully, “If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they’d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders.
But with no <PER>Hagrid</PER> visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at Fang's heels, the scene didn’t look right to <PER>Harry</PER>; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had tried to visit <PER>Hermione</PER>, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.
<PER>Harry</PER> constantly repeated <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s final words to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked everywhere <PER>Harry</PER> went, helped (rather reluctantly) by <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was strutting around the school as though <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had just been appointed Head Boy.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t realize what <PER>Harry</PER> was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER> had left, when, sitting right behind <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“Sir, why don’t you apply for the headmaster’s job?” “Now, now, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, though he couldn’t suppress a thin-lipped smile.
“I expect you’d have Father’s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job — I’ll tell Father you’re the best teacher here, sir <PER>Snape</PER> smirked as sir <PER>Snape</PER> swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into sir <PER>Snape</PER>'s cauldron.
“Let me at him,” <PER>Ron</PER> growled as <PER>Harry</PER> and Dean hung onto his arms.
“I don’t care, I don’t need my wand, I’m going to kill him with my bare hands — ” “Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,” barked <PER>Snape</PER> over the class’s heads, and off they marched, with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Dean bringing up the rear, <PER>Ron</PER> still trying to get loose.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found <PER>Harry</PER> face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan.
Ernie and <PER>Harry</PER>'s friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“That <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> character,” said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, “Ernie seems very pleased about all this, doesn’t he?
“Do you think it’s <PER>Malfoy</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>?” Ernie asked.
<PER>Harry</PER> hit <PER>Ron</PER> over the hand with his pruning shears.
“Ouch\ What ’re you — ” <PER>Harry</PER> pointed out the spiders, following the spiders's progress with <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes screwed up against the sun.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes narrowed as <PER>Harry</PER> focused on the spiders.
<PER>Ron</PER> started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when <PER>Harry</PER> kicked him hard under the desk.
But Lockhart’s disgusting cheeriness, Lockhart’s's hints that Lockhart had always thought <PER>Hagrid</PER> was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated <PER>Harry</PER> so much that <PER>Harry</PER> yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart’s stupid face.
Instead he contented he with scrawling a note to <PER>Ron</PER>: Let’s do it tonight <PER>Ron</PER> read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear.
Fred and George challenged <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to a few games of Exploding Snap, and <PER>Ginny</PER> sat watching them, very subdued in <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s usual chair.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> finally went to bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole.
<PER>Harry</PER> left the Invisibility Cloak on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s table.
“C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, patting <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.
<PER>Harry</PER> took out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, murmured, “Lumos\” and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside <PER>Harry</PER>'s little sphere of light was pitch-black.
<PER>Harry</PER> could vividly remember <PER>Hagrid</PER> advising <PER>Harry</PER> not to leave the forest path last time He’d been in here.
Something wet touched <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and <PER>Harry</PER> jumped backward, crushing <PER>Ron</PER>’s foot, but it was only Fang’s nose.
“What d’you reckon?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel Fang’s hot breath on <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> jump out of their skins.
“What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s elbow very hard.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, his voice breaking with relief.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, it’s our car!” “What?” “Come on!” <PER>Harry</PER> blundered after <PER>Ron</PER> toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.
him breathing slowing down again, <PER>Harry</PER> stuffed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly <PER>Harry</PER> felt something long and hairy seize <PER>Harry</PER> around the middle and lift <PER>Harry</PER> off the ground, so that <PER>Harry</PER> was hanging facedown.
Struggling, terrified, <PER>Harry</PER> heard more clicking, and saw <PER>Ron</PER>’s legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling — next moment, Fang was being swept away into the dark trees.
Head hanging, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that what had hold of <PER>Harry</PER> was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching <PER>Harry</PER> tightly below a pair of shining black pincers.
Behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear Fang fighting to free Fang from a third monster, whining loudly, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t have yelled even if Fang had wanted to; <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to have left <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice back with the car in the clearing.
<PER>Harry</PER> never knew how long <PER>Harry</PER> was in the creature’s clutches; <PER>Harry</PER> only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for <PER>Harry</PER> to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders.
Craning <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck sideways, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene <PER>Harry</PER> had ever laid eyes on.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Fang thudded down next to <PER>Ron</PER> and Fang.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked exactly like <PER>Harry</PER> felt.
<PER>Harry</PER> mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes were popping.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped <PER>Harry</PER> was saying something.
It had been hard to tell, because <PER>Harry</PER> clicked <PER>Harry</PER>'s pincers with every word he spoke.
“Is it <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said Aragog, moving closer, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s in trouble,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, breathing very fast.
“That’s why we’ve come.” “In trouble?” said the aged spider, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard concern beneath the clicking pincers.
“But why has <PER>Harry</PER> sent you?” <PER>Harry</PER> thought of getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet but decided against it; <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t think <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs would support <PER>Harry</PER>.
So <PER>Harry</PER> spoke from the ground, as calmly as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
Aragog was backing slowly into Aragog's domed web, but Aragog's fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well just go, then,” <PER>Harry</PER> called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
Even as he reached for his wand, <PER>Harry</PER> knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow.
Arthur’s car screeched to a halt in front of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and the doors flew open.
“Get Fang!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, diving into the front seat; <PER>Ron</PER> seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car — the doors slammed shut — <PER>Ron</PER> didn’t touch the accelerator but the car didn’t need — <PER>Ron</PER>; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> mouth was still open in the silent scream, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes weren’t popping anymore.
Fang flung Fang at the window in Fang's anxiety to get out, and when <PER>Harry</PER> opened the door, <PER>Harry</PER> shot off through the trees to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house, tail between Fang's legs.
<PER>Harry</PER> got out too, and after a minute or so, <PER>Hagrid</PER> seemed to regain the feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back into <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak.
When <PER>Harry</PER> got outside again, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER> being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.
“That’s exactly <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s problem!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, thumping the wall of the cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat on the edge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs up onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and leaned back against <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillows, watching the moon glinting at <PER>Harry</PER> through the tower window.
<PER>Harry</PER> was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly sat bolt upright.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” he hissed through the dark, “<PER>Ron</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER> woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly around, and saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We’re still getting exams?” There was a loud bang behind <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom’s wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk.
“And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the pair of white rabbits <PER>Harry</PER> was supposed to be turning into slippers.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked as though <PER>Harry</PER>’d just been told <PER>Harry</PER> had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest.
“Can you imagine me taking exams with this?” he asked <PER>Harry</PER>, holding up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, which had just started whistling loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn’t at all surprised to see that <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> hadn’t joined in.
<PER>Ginny</PER> didn’t say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded <PER>Harry</PER> of someone, though he couldn’t think who.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized who <PER>Ginny</PER> looked like.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was rocking backward and forward slightly in <PER>Ginny</PER>'s chair, exactly like Dobby did when Dobby was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.
“I’ve got to tell you something,” <PER>Ginny</PER> mumbled, carefully not looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ginny</PER> looked as though <PER>Ginny</PER> couldn’t find the right words.
<PER>Ginny</PER> opened <PER>Ginny</PER>'s mouth, but no sound came out.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> could hear him.
“Pass me those rolls, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m starving.” <PER>Harry</PER> knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help, but <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up — and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.
“The first words out of those poor Petrified people’s mouths will be ‘It was <PER>Hagrid</PER>.’ Frankly, I’m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.” “I agree, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making <PER>Ron</PER> drop his books in surprise.
“We were going to — to go and see — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We haven’t seen her for ages, Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on hurriedly, treading on <PER>Ron</PER>’s foot, “and we thought we’d sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry — ” Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice.
“That,” said <PER>Ron</PER> fervently, “was the best story you’ve ever come up with.” They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that They had Professor McGonagall’s permission to visit <PER>Hermione</PER>.
It was plain that <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t have the faintest inkling that <PER>Hermione</PER> had visitors, and that they might just as well tell <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.
“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking sadly at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s rigid face.
“Try and get it out,” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked <PER>Harry</PER> from Madam Pomfrey’s view.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> was going to tear the paper.
<PER>Harry</PER> smoothed it out eagerly and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned close to read it, too.
And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Hermione</PER>’s.
“A giant snake Someone would’ve seen ” <PER>Harry</PER>, however, pointed at the word <PER>Hermione</PER> had scribbled at the foot of the page.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> paced around it, too excited to sit down.
“Which student?” “<PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER>,” said Professor McGonagall.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ron</PER> slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
For one wild moment, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure it would be <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“She knew something, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staffroom.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see how <PER>Ginny</PER> could still be alive.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, “it’s not nearly as simple as that.
“Shouldn’t have let Professor <PER>Snape</PER> teach us that one,” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk aside.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still pointing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see that <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> hurried over to it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at the snake, willing <PER>Harry</PER> to believe it was alive.
If <PER>Harry</PER> moved <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, the candlelight made it look as though it were moving.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> gasp and looked up again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had made up <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind what <PER>Harry</PER> was going to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that <PER>Ginny</PER> might be alive.
“I’ll just — ” He put He's hand on the door knob, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> both pointed their wands at him.
“Boys, what good will it do?” <PER>Harry</PER> jabbed him in the back with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER> slowly into the pipe, then let go.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood aside as <PER>Ron</PER> came whizzing out of the pipe, too.
“Lumosl” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to Lumosl” <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and it lit again.
<PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand to look at the floor and saw that the floor was littered with small animal bones.
Trying very hard not to imagine what <PER>Ginny</PER> might look like if they found <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — there’s something up there — ” said <PER>Ron</PER> hoarsely, grabbing <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned back to look at the thing, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart beating so fast it hurt.
Very slowly, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes as narrow as <PER>Harry</PER> could make them and still see, <PER>Harry</PER> edged forward, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held high.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped forward, but too late — Lockhart was straightening up, panting, <PER>Ron</PER>’s wand in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and a gleaming smile back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> flung <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor.
“Wait there,” <PER>Harry</PER> called to <PER>Ron</PER>.
And then, at last, as <PER>Harry</PER> crept around yet another bend, <PER>Harry</PER> saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, two entwined serpents's eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.
<PER>Harry</PER> approached, <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat very dry.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to crane <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard’s sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>l” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to <PER>Ginny</PER>l” <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — don’t be dead — please don’t be dead — ” He flung He's wand aside, grabbed <PER>Ginny</PER>’s shoulders, and turned <PER>Ginny</PER>'s over.
But then Her must be — “<PER>Ginny</PER>, please wake up,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered desperately, shaking <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped and spun around on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees.
A tall, black-haired boy was strangely blurred around the edges, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were looking at <PER>Harry</PER> through a misted window.
But there was no mistaking <PER>Harry</PER> — “Tom — Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>?” <PER>Riddle</PER> nodded, not taking his eyes off <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> stood, a weird, misty light shining about Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>, not a day older than sixteen.
“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, raising <PER>Ginny</PER>’s head again.
<PER>Harry</PER>, sweating, managed to hoist <PER>Ginny</PER> half off the floor, and bent to pick up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand again.
<PER>Riddle</PER> was still watching He — twirling <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand between his long fingers.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, stretching out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand for it.
“Listen,” said <PER>Harry</PER> urgently, <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees sagging with <PER>Ginny</PER>’s dead weight.
<PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Ginny</PER> back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer.
“What d’you mean, I won’t be — ?” “I’ve waited a long time for this, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“Haven’t you guessed yet, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” said <PER>Riddle</PER> softly.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER> opened the Chamber of Secrets.
“It took a very long time for stupid little <PER>Ginny</PER> to stop trusting <PER>Ginny</PER>'s diary,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“Well, you see, <PER>Ginny</PER> told me all about you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“It was my word against <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after <PER>Hagrid</PER> was expelled,” said <PER>Riddle</PER> carelessly.
He stared numbly at <PER>Riddle</PER>, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder <PER>Harry</PER>’s own parents, and so many others.
“Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!” Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hissed.
<PER>Harry</PER> was speaking at random, wanting to scare <PER>Riddle</PER>, wishing rather than believing it to be true — <PER>Riddle</PER> opened his mouth, but froze.
It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on <PER>Harry</PER>’s scalp and made <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size.
Then, as the music reached such a pitch that <PER>Harry</PER> felt it vibrating inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.
The bird sat still and warm next to <PER>Harry</PER>’s cheek, gazing steadily at <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“Fawkes?” <PER>Harry</PER> breathed, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the bird’s golden claws squeeze <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder gently.
<PER>Riddle</PER> laughed so hard that the dark Chamber rang with it, as though ten <PER>Riddle</PER>s were laughing at once — “This is what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sends <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s defender!
“To business, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>, still smiling broadly.
<PER>Riddle</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel.
It looked bad, all right but the longer <PER>Riddle</PER> stood there, the more life was dwindling out of <PER>Ginny</PER> and in the meantime, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed suddenly, <PER>Riddle</PER>’s outline was becoming clearer, more solid.
<PER>Harry</PER>, fear spreading up <PER>Harry</PER>'s numb legs, watched <PER>Riddle</PER> stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness.
<PER>Riddle</PER> opened his mouth wide and hissed — but <PER>Harry</PER> understood what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying .
“ Speak to me, Slytherin , greatest of the Hogwarts Four.” <PER>Harry</PER> wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
Horrorstruck, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.
<PER>Harry</PER> backed away until <PER>Harry</PER> hit the dark Chamber wall, and as <PER>Harry</PER> shut <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes tight <PER>Harry</PER> felt Fawkes’ wing sweep <PER>Harry</PER>'s cheek as <PER>Harry</PER> took flight.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt it shudder <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was happening, <PER>Harry</PER> could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin’s mouth.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Riddle</PER>’s hissing voice: “Kill him.” The basilisk was moving toward <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> could hear The basilisk heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor.
Eyes still tightly shut, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> began to run blindly sideways, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands outstretched, feeling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s way — <PER>Voldemort</PER> was laughing <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> tripped.
— <PER>Voldemort</PER> fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood — the serpent was barely feet from — <PER>Voldemort</PER>, — <PER>Voldemort</PER> could hear the serpent coming — There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> so hard that <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was smashed into the wall.
Waiting for fangs to sink through <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s body <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars — <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help it — <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on.
As <PER>Harry</PER> trembled, ready to close <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes if it turned, <PER>Harry</PER> saw what had distracted the snake.
The snake’s tail thrashed, narrowly missing <PER>Harry</PER>, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could shut <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, it turned — <PER>Harry</PER> looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.
“NO!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Riddle</PER> screaming.
Help me — help me — <PER>Harry</PER> thought, — <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes screwed tight under the hat.
Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head, almost knocking <PER>Harry</PER> out.
Stars winking in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised the sword in both <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands — The basilisk lunged again, and this time The basilisk aim was true — <PER>Harry</PER> threw — <PER>Harry</PER>'s whole weight behind the sword and drove the sword to the hilt into the roof of the serpent’s mouth — But as warm blood drenched — <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms, — <PER>Harry</PER> felt a searing pain just above — <PER>Harry</PER>'s elbow.
<PER>Harry</PER> gripped the fang that was spreading poison through <PER>Harry</PER>'s body and wrenched ] body out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
A patch of scarlet swam past, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard a soft clatter of claws beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You’re dead, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>’s voice above him.
“So ends the famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Riddle</PER>’s distant voice.
“Get away from he — I said, get away — ” <PER>Harry</PER> raised ” <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Riddle</PER> was pointing <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.
“Phoenix tears ” said <PER>Riddle</PER> quietly, staring at <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
“Of course healing powers I forgot <PER>Harry</PER> looked into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
For a split second, both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Riddle</PER>, wand still raised, stared at it.
Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, <PER>Harry</PER> seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to <PER>Harry</PER> and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.
<PER>Riddle</PER> was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then — <PER>Riddle</PER> had gone.
Shaking all over, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> up.
Slowly, <PER>Harry</PER> gathered together <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk’s mouth.
her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over <PER>Harry</PER>, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — oh, <PER>Harry</PER> — I tried to tell you at b- breakfast, but I c -couldn’t say it in front of Percy — it was me, <PER>Harry</PER> — but I — I s-swear I d-didn’t mean to — R-<PER>Riddle</PER> made me, R-<PER>Riddle</PER> t-took me over — and — how did you kill that — that thing?
<PER>Harry</PER> urged <PER>Ginny</PER> forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, speeding up.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>” <PER>Ron</PER> thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull <PER>Ginny</PER>” <PER>Ron</PER>'s through first.
“He’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, squeezing through <PER>Harry</PER>.
“How come you’ve got a sword?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, gaping at the glittering weapon in <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
“I’ll explain when we get out of here,” said <PER>Harry</PER> with a sideways glance at <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was crying harder than ever.
He didn’t think it was a good idea to tell <PER>Ron</PER> yet who’d been opening the Chamber, not in front of <PER>Ginny</PER>, anyway.
“Have you thought how we’re going to get back up this?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past <PER>Harry</PER> and was now fluttering in front of Fawkes, Fawkes's beady eyes bright in the dark.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked uncertainly at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“But you’re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there — ” “Fawkes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “isn’t an ordinary bird.” <PER>Harry</PER> turned quickly to the others.
“You hold <PER>Ginny</PER>’s other hand — ” <PER>Harry</PER> tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, <PER>Ron</PER> took hold of the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes, and <PER>Harry</PER> reached out and took hold of Fawkes’s strangely hot tail feathers.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear Lockhart dangling below <PER>Harry</PER>, saying, “Amazing!
“Where now?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, with an anxious look at <PER>Ginny</PER>.
For a moment there was silence as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in <PER>Harry</PER>’s case) blood.
Fawkes went whooshing past <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear and settled on Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s shoulder, just as <PER>Harry</PER> found himself and <PER>Ron</PER> being swept into Molly’s tight embrace.
Molly let go of <PER>Harry</PER>, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted sword, and what remained of <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary.
For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: he told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how <PER>Hermione</PER> had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and <PER>Ron</PER> had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom.
“Very well,” Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, “so you found out where the entrance was — breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add — but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?” So <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice about Fawkes’s timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword.
him had so far avoided mentioning <PER>Riddle</PER>’s diary — or <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Instinctively, <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.
“What interests me most,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gently, “is how Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> managed to enchant <PER>Ginny</PER>, when my sources tell me Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.” Relief — warm, sweeping, glorious relief — swept over <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Riddle</PER> wrote it when “<PER>Riddle</PER> was sixteen.
“Very few people know that Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> was once called Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“What’s our <PER>Ginny</PER> got to do with — with — him?” “His d-diary!” <PER>Ginny</PER> sobbed.
“There has been no lasting harm done, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Ill leave you to deal with Potter and <PER>Weasley</PER>, shall I?” “Certainly,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
She left, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> gazed uncertainly at Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s vague smile.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> addressed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Lockhart looked over Lockhart's shoulder to see who Lockhart was talking to.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> said quickly, “there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets.
“He’ll lend you one.” “Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> cast a curious look back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> as he closed the door.
“Sit down, <PER>Harry</PER>,” he said, and <PER>Harry</PER> sat, feeling unaccountably nervous.
“First of all, <PER>Harry</PER>, I want to thank you,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, eyes twinkling again.
<PER>Harry</PER> grinned awkwardly as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And so you met Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thoughtfully.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Riddle</PER> said I’m like Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Riddle</PER>.
“And what do you think, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “I don’t think I’m like him!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, more loudly than <PER>Harry</PER>’d intended.
“It certainly seems so.” “So I should be in Slytherin,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking desperately into <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face.
“If you want proof, <PER>Harry</PER>, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reached across to Professor McGonagall’s desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed the blood-stained silver sword to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> simply.
<PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> stood there, fury in <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s face.
And cowering behind <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.
“Good evening, <PER>Lucius</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pleasantly.
Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> almost knocked <PER>Harry</PER> over as <PER>Harry</PER> swept into the room.
Dobby went scurrying in after <PER>Harry</PER>, crouching at the hem of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak, a look of abject terror on his face.
“Who is it?” “The same person as last time, <PER>Lucius</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
His great eyes fixed meaningfully on <PER>Harry</PER>, His kept pointing at the diary, then at Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and then hitting His hard on the head with His's fist.
“I see ” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> slowly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“A clever plan,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in a level voice, still staring Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> straight in the eye.
“Because if <PER>Harry</PER> here” — Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> shot <PER>Harry</PER> a swift, sharp look — “and his friend <PER>Ron</PER> hadn’t discovered this book, why — <PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER> might have taken all the blame.
— <PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER> face was suddenly masklike.
And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary, then to <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, then punching himself in the head.
<PER>Harry</PER> nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears in punishment.
“Don’t you want to know how <PER>Ginny</PER> got hold of that diary, Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> rounded on him.
“Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then it came to <PER>Harry</PER> — “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” he said hurriedly.
“Can I give that diary back to Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, please?” “Certainly, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, <PER>Harry</PER> took off one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoes, pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into the diary.
“Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, skidding to a halt, “I’ve got something for you — ” And <PER>Harry</PER> forced the smelly sock into <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hand.
“What the — ?” Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> ripped the sock off the diary, threw the smelly sock into <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hand aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby — Dobby is free.” <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> stood frozen, staring at the elf.
“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!” But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” There was a loud bang, and Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> was thrown backward.
Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> got up, Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s face livid, and pulled out Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing up at <PER>Harry</PER>, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter set Dobby free!” “Least I could do, Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as Dobby pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>’s sock with shaking hands.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter sobbed.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know whether the best bit was <PER>Hermione</PER> running toward <PER>Harry</PER>, screaming “You solved it!
Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences — Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (“but we’ve had plenty of practice at that anyway,” <PER>Ron</PER> told a disgruntled <PER>Hermione</PER>) and <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been sacked as a school governor.
<PER>Draco</PER> was no longer strutting around the school as though <PER>Draco</PER> owned the place.
On the other hand, <PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Weasley</PER> was perfectly happy again.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> got a compartment to themselves.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — what did you see Percy doing, that Percy didn’t want you to tell anyone?” “Oh, that,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, giggling.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill and a bit of parchment and turned to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
