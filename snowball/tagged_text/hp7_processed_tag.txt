“Severus, here,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, indicating the seat on <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s immediate right.
Most of the eyes around the table followed <PER>Snape</PER>, and it was to <PER>Snape</PER> that <PER>Voldemort</PER> spoke first.
“So?” “My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move <PER>Harry</PER> Potter from <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.” The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER>, however, looked calmly back into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s face and, after a moment or two, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.
“My Lord.” Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
“My Lord, I have heard differently.” Yaxley waited, but <PER>Voldemort</PER> did not speak, so <PER>Voldemort</PER> went on, “Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.” <PER>Snape</PER> was smiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> seemed to be lost in thought.
“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy <PER>Voldemort</PER> held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as <PER>Voldemort</PER> turned back to <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER>, however, seemed to be speaking more to <PER>Voldemort</PER> than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Wormtail,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, with no change in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s eyes from the revolving body above, “have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?” “Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in a small man's chair that it had appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied.
“As I was saying,” continued <PER>Voldemort</PER>, looking again at the tense faces of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s followers, “I understand better now.
Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, and Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes were sunken and shadowed.
At Shis touch, <PER>Malfoy</PER> put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed a wand along to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely.
Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> expected to receive <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand in exchange for Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s own.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“We did desire it — We do.” To <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, his wife's eyes averted from <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the snake.
To his right, his son, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at <PER>Voldemort</PER> and away again, terrified to make eye contact.
“Will you babysit the cubs?” The hilarity mounted; <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked in terror at <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s father, who was staring down into <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s own lap, then caught <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s mother’s eye.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “Enough,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, stroking the angry snake.
<PER>Snape</PER> raised <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes to the upside-down face.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “And you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” asked <PER>Voldemort</PER>, stroking the snake’s snout with <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand-free hand.
“Severus please please ” “Silence,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, with another twitch of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked back at her, quite impassive, as her turned slowly away from <PER>Snape</PER> again.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> fell out of <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s onto the floor.
“Dinner, Nagini,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered from <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s shoulders onto the polished wood.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER> was bleeding.
Clutching <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand in <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER>'s left and swearing under <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER> shouldered open <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom door.
Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, <PER>Harry</PER> scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom door.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> tramped across to the bathroom to run <PER>Harry</PER>'s finger under the tap.
<PER>Harry</PER> had spent the morning completely emptying <PER>Harry</PER>'s school trunk for the first time since <PER>Harry</PER> had packed it six years ago.
Minutes previously, <PER>Harry</PER> had plunged <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood.
<PER>Harry</PER> laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather’s last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat up and examined the jagged piece on which <PER>Harry</PER> had cut <PER>Harry</PER>, seeing nothing but <PER>Harry</PER>'s own bright green eye reflected back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk.
As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, <PER>Harry</PER> slowed down, searching for one particular issue that <PER>Harry</PER> knew had arrived shortly after <PER>Harry</PER> had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts.
Turning to page ten, <PER>Harry</PER> sank into <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk chair and reread the article <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking for.
Beyond that, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> refused to speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make <PER>Dumbledore</PER> do so.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would become Minister of Magic.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was never proud or vain; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was wearing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying <PER>Harry</PER>, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.
Never once had he imagined <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as <PER>Harry</PER> had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old.
The idea of a teenage <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid <PER>Hermione</PER> or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and <PER>Harry</PER> had not thought to ask <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what that had been like, nor about any of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s other famous achievements.
No, they had always discussed <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s past, <PER>Harry</PER>’s future, <PER>Harry</PER>’s plans and it seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> now, despite the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>'s future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that <PER>Harry</PER> had missed irreplaceable opportunities when <PER>Harry</PER> had failed to ask <PER>Dumbledore</PER> more about <PER>Harry</PER>, even though the only personal question <PER>Harry</PER> had ever asked <PER>Harry</PER>'s headmaster was also the only one <PER>Harry</PER> suspected that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not answered honestly: “ What do you see when you look in the mirror?” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “!?
<PER>Harry</PER> had merely glanced at the headline when <PER>Harry</PER> had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
It was only now, therefore, that <PER>Harry</PER> saw what <PER>Harry</PER> had missed.
Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> carried to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s grave.
HOW did <PER>Dumbledore</PER> really meet <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s end?
The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, by <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page 13, inside.
In person, <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter is much warmer and softer than <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's famously ferocious quill-portraits might suggest.
Greeting me in the hallway of <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's cozy home, <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip.
“Well, of course, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is a biographer’s dream,” says <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter.
“I’m afraid those who go dewy-eyed over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s spectacular victory must brace those who go dewy-eyed over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s spectacular victory for a bombshell — or perhaps a Dungbomb.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s legions of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s legions of admirers's hero.
his began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what his was doing, as random phrases from <PER>Rita</PER>’s article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter-<PER>Dumbledore</PER> relationship It’s been called unhealthy, even sinister .
his dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth I’ve had access to a source most journalists would swap most journalists's wands for “Lies!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, and through the window <PER>Harry</PER> saw the next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart <PER>Harry</PER>'s lawn mower, look up nervously.
The broken bit of mirror danced away from <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> picked it up and turned it over in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers, thinking, thinking of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and the lies with which <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was defaming him.
<PER>Harry</PER> froze, <PER>Harry</PER>'s cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had imagined it, <PER>Harry</PER> must have done.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia’s choosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect.
<PER>Harry</PER> peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but <PER>Harry</PER>'s own bright green eye looking back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because <PER>Harry</PER> had been thinking of <PER>Harry</PER>'s dead headmaster.
It was not until his uncle bellowed, “BOY!” that <PER>Harry</PER> got slowly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things <PER>Harry</PER> would be taking with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Get down here, I want a word!” <PER>Harry</PER> strolled downstairs, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands deep in <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans pockets.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the living room <PER>Harry</PER> found all three Dursleys.
They were dressed for traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling a neat salmon-colored coat, and <PER>Dudley</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s large, blond, muscular cousin, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s leather jacket.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyebrows.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was coming.
<PER>Harry</PER> uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER> following his movements with anxious expressions.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s favorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that <PER>Dudley</PER> had added <PER>Harry</PER>'s dumbbells to <PER>Harry</PER>'s case since the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had rather impressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle with this argument.
“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that this Lord Thing — ” “ — <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, “and we’ve been through this about a hundred times already.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to admit, however, that as Arthur had once demolished half of the living room, <PER>Harry</PER>'s reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.
Getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, <PER>Harry</PER> advanced on <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle, now pointing at the TV set <PER>Harry</PER>.
With his parents’ and <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes upon him, him slowly lowered them again and asked, “There are more of them?” “More?” laughed <PER>Harry</PER>.
Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; <PER>Dudley</PER> was staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They will torture and kill you like They did my parents !” “Dad,” said <PER>Dudley</PER> in a loud voice, “Dad — I’m going with these Order people.” “<PER>Dudley</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “for the first time in your life, you’re talking sense.” He knew that the battle was won.
“They’ll be here in about five minutes,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and when none of the Dursleys replied, <PER>Harry</PER> left the room.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling Back in his bedroom, <PER>Harry</PER> fiddled aimlessly with <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack, then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, then headed back out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s room and downstairs.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow.
“There’s no need,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly, “Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.” He swung He's right arm upward to shake <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome.
<PER>Dudley</PER> did not answer, but stood there with <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth slightly ajar, reminding <PER>Harry</PER> a little of the giant, Grawp.
<PER>Dudley</PER> raised a large, hamlike hand to point at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, he — he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at <PER>Harry</PER> and adding, “You don’t want to, do you?” “Not in the slightest,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had met this attitude before: Witches and wizards seemed stunned that <PER>Harry</PER>'s closest living relatives took so little interest in the famous <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.
“these people think I’m a waste of space, actually, but I’m used to — ” “I don’t think you’re a waste of space.” If <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen <PER>Dudley</PER>’s lips move, <PER>Harry</PER> might not have believed it.
As it was, <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Dudley</PER> for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing, <PER>Dudley</PER> had turned red.
<PER>Harry</PER> was embarrassed and astonished <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well er thanks, <PER>Dudley</PER>.” Again, <PER>Dudley</PER> appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling, “You saved my life.” “Not really,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
They had had virtually no contact during this summer or last, as <PER>Harry</PER> had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to <PER>Harry</PER>'s room so much.
It now dawned on <PER>Harry</PER>, however, that the cup of cold tea on which <PER>Harry</PER> had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all.
Hestia Jones gave Aunt Petunia's an approving look that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced <PER>Dudley</PER> rather than <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He only said He didn’t think <PER>Harry</PER> was a waste of space!” “Yeah, but coming from <PER>Dudley</PER> that’s like ‘I love you,’ ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at <PER>Dudley</PER> as if he had just saved <PER>Harry</PER> from a burning building.
“Our thoughts go with you.” “I hope everything’s okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and <PER>Dudley</PER>.
<PER>Dudley</PER> gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and walked toward <PER>Harry</PER>, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic.
“Blimey, <PER>Dudley</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs, “did the dementors blow a different personality into you?” “Dunno,” muttered <PER>Dudley</PER>.
“See you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “Yeah ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, taking <PER>Dudley</PER>’s hand and shaking it.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Harry</PER>'s heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed.
For a moment <PER>Harry</PER> had the strangest feeling that She wanted to say something to <PER>Harry</PER>: She gave <PER>Harry</PER> an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little jerk of Shis head, She bustled out of the room after Shis husband and son.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER> ran back upstairs to <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's bedroom, arriving at the window just in time to see the Dursleys’ car swinging out of the drive and off up the road.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up Hedwig’s cage, <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack, gave <PER>Harry</PER>'s unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made <PER>Harry</PER>'s ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where <PER>Harry</PER> deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs.
But <PER>Harry</PER> could still remember the dreams that had dogged <PER>Harry</PER>, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once — Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when <PER>Harry</PER> had recounted the car — a flying motorbike There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby.
<PER>Harry</PER> straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head on the low door frame.
There was a general cry of greeting as <PER>Hermione</PER> flung her arms around him, <PER>Ron</PER> clapped him on the back, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, “All righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Let’s get undercover before we talk you through it.” <PER>Harry</PER> led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat they upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against Aunt Petunia’s's spotless appliances: <PER>Ron</PER>, long and lanky; <PER>Hermione</PER>, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long- P a g e ?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: <PER>Harry</PER>’s felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom <PER>Harry</PER>’s had tried to strangle the last time they had met.
“So what are we going to do?” “We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s motorbike.” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER> could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them.
“Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Harry</PER> did not smile.
“Funny,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “really amusing.” “If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as his glared at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“With <PER>Voldemort</PER> out there and half the Ministry on <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s side?
“So, Potter — some of your hair, if you please.” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, who grimaced at him in a just- do-it sort of way.
With all of their eyes upon him, <PER>Harry</PER> reached up to the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.
“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, before catching sight of <PER>Ron</PER>’s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, “Oh, you know what I mean — Goyle ’s potion looked like bogies.” “Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,” said Moody.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink.
“Here,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> gruffly, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> gruffly lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead.
“Altogether, then ” <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and Mundungus were shooting upward; <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s and Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls.
“I knew <PER>Ginny</PER> was lying about that tattoo,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking down at his bare chest.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, your eyesight really is awful,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> put on glasses.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom — ” “Why’m I with you?” grunted the <PER>Harry</PER> nearest the back door.
“She’s not that fond of brooms.” Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look that <PER>Harry</PER> hoped with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart would never appear on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face again.
“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hermione</PER> too lacked confidence on a broomstick.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Ron</PER> did not look quite as pleased as <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“An’ the last time yeh was on it, <PER>Harry</PER>, I could fit yeh in one hand!” <PER>Harry</PER> could not help but feel a little humiliated as <PER>Harry</PER> got into the sidecar.
It placed <PER>Harry</PER> several feet below everybody else: <PER>Ron</PER> smirked at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER> sitting there like a child in a bumper car.
<PER>Harry</PER> stuffed <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack and broomstick down by <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees.
“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, quite oblivious to <PER>Harry</PER>’s discomfort.
<PER>Harry</PER> settled <PER>Harry</PER> astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground.
“Hold tight now, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said Tonks, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side of her waist.
<PER>Harry</PER> lost any sense of where they were: Streetlights above <PER>Harry</PER>, yells around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was clinging to the sidecar for dear life.
“No — NO!” The motorbike zoomed forward; <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as <PER>Hagrid</PER> blasted through their circle.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, TURN “My job’s ter get you there safe, <PER>Harry</PER>!” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>!” opened the throttle.
“Stop — STOP!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, but as <PER>Harry</PER> looked back again two jets of green light flew past <PER>Harry</PER>'s left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing Four Death Eaters, aiming for <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s broad back.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and <PER>Harry</PER> had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them.
“Hold on, <PER>Harry</PER>, this’ll do for ’em!” roared <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked up just in time to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge.
Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky: <PER>Harry</PER> vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, <PER>Harry</PER>'s broomstick broken into pieces.
One of <PER>Harry</PER>'s fellows slowed up to save <PER>Harry</PER>, but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as <PER>Hagrid</PER> leaned low over the handlebars and sped up.
More Killing Curses flew past <PER>Harry</PER>’s head from the two remaining Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening — “Here we go again, <PER>Harry</PER>, hold on!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> jabbed at a second button.
“This’ll do it, <PER>Harry</PER>, hold on tight!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer.
“It’s all righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>!” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, now thrown flat onto his back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike’s slipstream.
‘Tm on it, <PER>Harry</PER>, don’ worry!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket his pulled his flowery pink umbrella.
“I’m cornin’, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> yelled from out of the darkness, but <PER>Harry</PER> could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as <PER>Harry</PER> could, <PER>Harry</PER> pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, “Impedimental” The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment <PER>Harry</PER> was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though <PER>Harry</PER> had hit an invisible barrier: One of <PER>Harry</PER>'s fellows almost collided with <PER>Harry</PER> — Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat — “I’m cornin’, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m cornin’!” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling A huge hand seized the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes and hoisted <PER>Harry</PER> out of the plummeting sidecar; <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack with <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> dragged <PER>Harry</PER> onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself back-to- back with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death Eaters, <PER>Harry</PER> spat blood out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, “Confringo\” <PER>Harry</PER> knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest the Death Eater nearest was blasted off the Death Eater nearest] broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “I shouldn’ta tried ter repair it meself — yeh’ve got no room — ” “It’s not a problem, just keep flying!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer.
As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, <PER>Hagrid</PER> swerved and zigzagged: <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Hagrid</PER> did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with <PER>Harry</PER> seated so insecurely.
<PER>Harry</PER> shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and The closest Death Eater's hood slipped, and by the red light of The closest Death Eater's next Stunning Spell, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike — Stan — “ ExpelliarmusV’ <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’s happened?” bellowed <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Where Ve they gone?” “I don’t know!” But <PER>Harry</PER> was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted “It’s the real one!”; how had <PER>Harry</PER> known?
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of here!” “Hold on tight, then, <PER>Harry</PER>!” There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust: <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> slipping backward off what little of the seat <PER>Harry</PER> had, <PER>Hagrid</PER> flung backward upon <PER>Harry</PER>, barely maintaining <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip on the handlebars — “I think we’ve lost ’em <PER>Harry</PER>, I think we’ve done it!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was not convinced: Fear lapped at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> looked left and right for pursuers <PER>Harry</PER> was sure would come.
“We’re nearly there, <PER>Harry</PER>, we’ve nearly made it!” shouted <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
Then the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead burned like fire; as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed <PER>Harry</PER> by millimeters, cast from behind — And then <PER>Harry</PER> saw him.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s snakelike face gleaming out of the blackness, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s white fingers raising <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand again — <PER>Hagrid</PER> let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw a body fly past <PER>Harry</PER> and knew <PER>Harry</PER> had hit one of them, but then <PER>Harry</PER> heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control — Green jets of light shot past them again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no idea which way was up, which down: <PER>Harry</PER> scar was still burning; <PER>Harry</PER> expected to die at any second.
A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, <PER>Harry</PER> saw it raise it arm — With a shout of fury <PER>Hagrid</PER> launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to his horror, <PER>Harry</PER> saw both <PER>Hagrid</PER> and the Death Eater falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the broomstick — Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> scream, “Mine\” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling It was over: He could not see or hear where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was; He glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, “Avada — ” As the pain from <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own accord.
The remaining Death Eater yelled; <PER>Voldemort</PER> screamed, “ No\ Somehow, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose an inch from the dragon-fire button.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> — Accio <PER>Hagrid</PER>l” The motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth.
Face level with the handlebars, <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: <PER>Harry</PER> was going to crash and there was nothing <PER>Harry</PER> could do about it.
Behind <PER>Harry</PER> came another scream, “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand\” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Voldemort</PER> before <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: <PER>Voldemort</PER> preparing to curse <PER>Voldemort</PER> once more — And then <PER>Voldemort</PER> vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> spread-eagled on the ground below <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting <PER>Harry</PER>, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground-trembling crash, <PER>Harry</PER> smashed into a muddy pond.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “<PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to raise <PER>Harry</PER> out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands sank into inches of muddy water as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to stand.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not understand where <PER>Voldemort</PER> had gone and expected <PER>Voldemort</PER> to swoop out of the darkness at any moment.
Something hot and wet was trickling down <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s chin and from <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s forehead.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s fine, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing to <PER>Harry</PER> now.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder and pushing <PER>Harry</PER> back against the cushions.
He only hoped they would continue to work: He imagined <PER>Voldemort</PER>, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate what <PER>Harry</PER> visualized as a great transparent bubble.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs off the sofa; <PER>Harry</PER> needed to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s own eyes before He would believe that He was alive.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into a hug that nearly cracked <PER>Harry</PER>'s newly repaired ribs.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?” “I don’t know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
A mixture of fear and guilt gripped <PER>Harry</PER> at the sight of their expressions; if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all <PER>Harry</PER>'s fault.
<PER>Harry</PER> had consented to the plan, given them <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack, swung it onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, where’s Hedwig?” “She She got hit,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The realization crashed over <PER>Harry</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> felt ashamed of <PER>Harry</PER> as the tears stung <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward, <PER>Harry</PER> was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, <PER>Harry</PER>'s finger glued to the Portkey as he and <PER>Hagrid</PER> hurtled away from Mister Tonks.
Seconds later <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet slammed onto hard ground and <PER>Harry</PER> fell onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow.
Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, <PER>Harry</PER> stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Molly and <PER>Ginny</PER> running down the steps by the back door as <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“We were surrounded the moment We took off — they knew it was tonight — I don’t know what happened to anyone else, four of they chased We, it was all We could do to get away, and then <PER>Voldemort</PER> caught up with We — ” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Voldemort</PER> could hear the self-justifying note in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s voice, the plea for her to understand why <PER>Voldemort</PER> did not know what had happened to her sons, but — “Thank goodness you’re all right,” her said, pulling him into a hug him did not feel him deserved.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> answered <PER>Harry</PER>'s unspoken plea for information at once.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks should have been back first, but <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks missed <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks's Portkey, it came back without them,” Portkey said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby.
As the lamplight fell across George’s head, <PER>Ginny</PER> gasped and <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach lurched: One of George’s ears was missing.
No sooner had Molly bent over Molly's son than Lupin grabbed <PER>Harry</PER> by the upper arm and dragged <PER>Harry</PER>, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where <PER>Hagrid</PER> was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door.
“What creature sat in the corner the first time that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter said, giving <PER>Harry</PER> a small shake.
“The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.” “None of the Order would have told <PER>Voldemort</PER> we were moving tonight,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The idea was dreadful to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER> could not believe it of any of them.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> only caught up with me toward the end, <PER>Voldemort</PER> didn’t know which one I was in the beginning.
Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at <PER>Harry</PER> for wanting to teach <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army how to Disarm.
“That’s <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s job.” Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, <PER>Hagrid</PER> staggered to a chair and sat down; a chair collapsed beneath him.
Lupin dived for the back door; <PER>Harry</PER> leapt over <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s legs and sprinted into the yard.
Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as <PER>Harry</PER> ran toward Two figures he realized Two figures were <PER>Hermione</PER>, now returning to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger.
<PER>Hermione</PER> flung <PER>Hermione</PER> into <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them.
Over <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulder <PER>Harry</PER> saw him raise him's wand and point it at Lupin’s chest.
“The last words Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke to the pair of us?” “ ‘<PER>Harry</PER> is the best hope we have.
“Who else is back?” “Only <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, George, and me.” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling <PER>Hermione</PER> stifled a little moan behind her hand.
“Followed by five, injured two, might’ve killed one,” Kingsley reeled off, “and we saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> as well, <PER>Voldemort</PER> joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly.
“I saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> too, <PER>Voldemort</PER> came after <PER>Hagrid</PER> and me.” “So that’s why he left, to follow you!” said Kingsley.
“ <PER>Snape</PER> ?” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, give us a hand!” called <PER>Hagrid</PER> hoarsely from the door, in which <PER>Harry</PER> was stuck again.
Glad of something to do, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> free, then headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Molly and <PER>Ginny</PER> were still tending to George.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> and Kingsley,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
They looked at each other; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to hug her, hold on to her; <PER>Harry</PER> did not even care much that Molly was there, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, now back off if you know what’s good for you!” <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard Arthur shout like that before.
<PER>Harry</PER> burst into the living room, <PER>Harry</PER>'s bald patch gleaming with sweat, <PER>Harry</PER>'s spectacles askew, Fred right behind Fred, both pale but uninjured.
“Hi, <PER>Harry</PER> — you are <PER>Harry</PER>, right?” “Yeah, I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, moving closer to the sofa.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ginny</PER> and motioned to her to accompany him back outside.
<PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks, seeming to crawl over <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks's skin, throbbing in <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks's chest, clogging <PER>Ron</PER> and Tonks's throat.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence.
None <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling of them looked around when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> joined <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>'s silent vigil.
<PER>Ron</PER> tripped dazedly toward <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“So what happened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turning to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Kingsley.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow’s boundaries.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though something inside <PER>Harry</PER> was falling, falling through the earth, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> forever.
Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief: Tonks had been close to Mad-Eye, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, <PER>Harry</PER>'s favorite and <PER>Harry</PER>'s protegee at the Ministry of Magic.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had just risked his own life to save <PER>Harry</PER>’s — <PER>Hagrid</PER>, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into giving <PER>Voldemort</PER> crucial information in exchange for a dragon’s egg.
“No,” <PER>Harry</PER> said aloud, and they all looked at <PER>Harry</PER>, surprised: The firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No, I think you’re like James,” said Lupin, “who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.” <PER>Harry</PER> knew what Lupin was getting at: that <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had been betrayed by his father's friend, Peter Pettigrew.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from <PER>Harry</PER>, set down <PER>Harry</PER>'s glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, “There’s work to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling “I know that — ” “Mad-Eye wouldn’t want — ” “I KNOW!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what they had done for <PER>Harry</PER>, didn’t they understand that it was for precisely that reason that He wanted to go now, before they had to suffer any more on He's behalf?
“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, but my wand spun in my hand and found <PER>Voldemort</PER> and shot a spell at <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at the gate overgrown plants, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s pounding forehead and thinking of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have believed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew it.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have known how and why <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had acted independently, because <PER>Dumbledore</PER> always had the answers; <PER>Harry</PER> had known about wands, had explained to <PER>Harry</PER> the strange connection that existed between <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s.
But <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s parents, like <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s poor owl, all were gone where <PER>Harry</PER> could never talk to them again.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a burning in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling And then, out of nowhere, the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar peaked.
It was several moments before he realized that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were at his side.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come back in the house,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“You aren’t still thinking of leaving?” “Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, thumping <PER>Harry</PER> on the back.
“Are you all right?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, close enough now to look into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding world!
<PER>Harry</PER> felt that nothing but action would assuage <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.
“I think <PER>Hermione</PER>’s been doing a bit of research,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Molly had gone upstairs to wake <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.
“It’s one extra day,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> looked mutinous.
Shortly before lunch, Molly detached <PER>Harry</PER> from the others by asking <PER>Harry</PER> to help identify a lone man’s sock that she thought might have come out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone.
“Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left me stuff to do,” mumbled <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> know about it, and they want to come too.” “What sort of ‘stuff’?” “I’m sorry, I can’t — ” “Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I’m sure Mister and Mistress Granger would agree!” said Molly.
<PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> to look directly into her eyes, noticing as <PER>Harry</PER> did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as <PER>Ginny</PER>’s.
From that moment on, Molly kept <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think.
All the jobs her handed out seemed to keep <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> away from one another; <PER>Harry</PER> had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night, when <PER>Harry</PER> had told them about <PER>Voldemort</PER> torturing Ollivander.
“I think Mum thinks that if Mum can stop the three of you getting together and planning, Mum’ll be able to delay you leaving,” <PER>Ginny</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of <PER>Harry</PER>'s stay.
“Someone else might kill off <PER>Voldemort</PER> while she’s holding us here making vol-au- vents?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> had spoken without thinking, and saw <PER>Ginny</PER>’s face whiten.
Suddenly <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that this was the first time that <PER>Harry</PER> had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds.
Arthur had explained that after the death of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had confided Grimmauld Place’s location had become a Secret- Keeper in turn.
“Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against <PER>Snape</PER> in case <PER>Snape</PER> turns up there again.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> crammed beside <PER>Ginny</PER>; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made <PER>Harry</PER> wish them had been separated by a few more people.
<PER>Harry</PER> was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm <PER>Harry</PER> could barely cut <PER>Harry</PER>'s chicken.
“Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ’ave ’ad champagne.” From this, <PER>Harry</PER> gathered that she still suspected <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Now, <PER>Ron</PER>, have you cleaned out your room yet?” “ Why?” exclaimed <PER>Ron</PER>, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother.
“I can help, some of it’s my mess,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER>, but Molly cut across him.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the chickens, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they’re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.” But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens.
The room was just as messy as The room had been all week; the only change was that <PER>Hermione</PER> was now sitting in the far corner, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, sorting books, some of which <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, into two enormous piles.
“And how did you manage to get away?” “Oh, <PER>Ron</PER>’s mum forgot that she asked <PER>Ginny</PER> and me to change the sheets yesterday,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I wasn’t trying to upset — ” But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, <PER>Ron</PER> bounded off the bed and got there first.
Looking rather pleased with himself, <PER>Ron</PER> handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But you know what he’d say to us if he was here?” “ ‘C-constant vigilance,’ ” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, mopping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried as <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched the book from <PER>Ron</PER>’s leg and retied it shut.
“I forgot we’ll be hunting down <PER>Voldemort</PER> in a mobile library.” “Ha ha,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking down at Spellman’s Syllabary.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at He with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance.
“I know you said after <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s funeral that you wanted to come with me,” <PER>Harry</PER> began.
“Here he goes,” <PER>Ron</PER> said to <PER>Hermione</PER>, rolling his eyes.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, you listen,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> got back off the bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at <PER>Harry</PER> as though reproaching <PER>Harry</PER> for lack of tact.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for <PER>Ron</PER> to be teaching anyone else tact.
“I — <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’m sorry — I didn’t — ” “Didn’t realize that <PER>Ron</PER> and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you?
“C’mon.” “Why?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, following <PER>Ron</PER> out of the room onto the tiny landing.
“Come and have a look at him.” <PER>Harry</PER> followed <PER>Ron</PER> up the few short steps into the tiny attic space.
<PER>Harry</PER> head and shoulders were in the room before <PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from <PER>Harry</PER>, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open.
It was human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now that <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of <PER>Ron</PER>’s pajamas.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s me, see?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
They climbed back down the ladder, which <PER>Ron</PER> returned to the ceiling, and rejoined <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was still sorting books.
“It is!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, clearly frustrated that <PER>Harry</PER> had not grasped the brilliance of the plan.
<PER>Ron</PER> sat watching her, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked from one to the other, unable to say anything.
The measures they had taken to protect their families made <PER>Harry</PER> realize, more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with <PER>Harry</PER> and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.” “Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she’s too young to come on shis own,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee.
Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, <PER>Harry</PER> was drawn to the place where it had happened, wanting to understand.
“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s keeping a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked.
“He said in He's note he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?” <PER>Harry</PER> dragged <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack toward <PER>Harry</PER> and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.
“Whichever,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “it’d be one less for us to do!” “Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren’t we?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “to find out whether or not it’s destroyed.” “And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “I’ve been researching that.” “How?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> removed them all, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t destroy them all.” <PER>Ron</PER> sat up straight, wide-eyed.
“How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?” “It — it wasn’t stealing!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER> with a kind of desperation.
“Just after his — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s — funeral,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in an even smaller voice.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sure <PER>Riddle</PER> already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; <PER>Ron</PER> jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and <PER>Harry</PER> instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that his was looking up at Molly, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage.
“I’m sure you all need your rest but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.” “Oh yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking terrified as <PER>Hermione</PER> leapt to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, sending books flying in every direction, “we will we’re sorry ” With an anguished look at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried out of the room after Molly.
“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained <PER>Ron</PER> in an undertone, still massaging his head as his and <PER>Harry</PER> followed.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur’s family by this time, and it was with ill grace that <PER>Ron</PER> stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and <PER>Harry</PER> attempted to flatten <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair.
Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house.
“Oi, wake up.” <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
“I think <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s looking for <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” “Poor bloke,” said <PER>Ron</PER> fervently.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat up, still rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar, now wide awake.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to remember exactly what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley.
“I think <PER>Harry</PER>’s abroad.” “Who, Gregorovitch?” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Do me a favor and don’t tell <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Reveling in the removal of his Trace, <PER>Harry</PER> sent <PER>Ron</PER>’s possessions flying around the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage.
<PER>Harry</PER> also tried tying the laces of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on <PER>Ron</PER>’s Chudley Cannons posters bright blue.
“I’d do your fly by hand, though,” <PER>Ron</PER> advised <PER>Harry</PER>, sniggering when <PER>Harry</PER> immediately checked it.
“I’m afraid that one isn’t new like <PER>Ron</PER>’s, it was actually my brother Fabian’s and he wasn’t terribly careful with his possessions, it’s a bit dented on the back, but — ” The rest of her speech was lost; <PER>Harry</PER> had got up and hugged her.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted <PER>Harry</PER>'s cheek clumsily when <PER>Harry</PER> released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor.
“Happy birthday, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, hurrying into the kitchen and adding <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own present to the top of the pile.
“Come on, then, open <PER>Hermione</PER>’s!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded.
“I’ll pack these for you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said brightly, taking <PER>Harry</PER>’s presents out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms as the three of them headed back upstairs.
“I’m nearly done, I’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER>’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, will you come in here a moment?” It was <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> came to an abrupt halt, but <PER>Hermione</PER> took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs.
Feeling nervous, <PER>Harry</PER> followed <PER>Ginny</PER> into her room.
A desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and <PER>Ginny</PER> had once played two-a-side Quidditch with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee.
<PER>Ginny</PER> looked up into <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, took a deep breath, and said, “Happy seventeenth.” “Yeah thanks.” <PER>Ginny</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER> steadily; <PER>Harry</PER>, however, found it difficult to look back at <PER>Ginny</PER>; it was like gazing into a brilliant light.
“So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing whatever you’re doing.” “I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest.” “There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” She whispered, and then She was kissing him as She had never kissed him before, and <PER>Harry</PER> was kissing Shis back, and it was blissful oblivion, better than firewhisky; She was the only real thing in the world, <PER>Ginny</PER>, the feel of She, one hand at Shis back and one in Shis long, sweet-smelling hair — The door banged open behind them and them jumped apart.
“Sorry.” “<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was just behind him, slightly out of breath.
There was a strained silence, then <PER>Ginny</PER> said in a flat little voice, “Well, happy birthday anyway, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears were scarlet; <PER>Hermione</PER> looked nervous.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s shining moment had popped like a soap bubble.
All the reasons for ending his relationship with <PER>Ginny</PER>, for staying well away from <PER>Ginny</PER>, seemed to have slunk inside the room with <PER>Ron</PER>, and all happy forgetfulness was gone.
<PER>Ron</PER> marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and <PER>Harry</PER> kept pace with him all the way, <PER>Hermione</PER> trotting along behind them looking scared.
Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, <PER>Ron</PER> rounded on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — ” But <PER>Ron</PER> held up a hand to silence her.
“Okay?” <PER>Ron</PER> looked half resentful, half sheepish; <PER>Harry</PER> rocked backward and forward on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet for a moment, then said, “Right then, well, that’s yeah.” <PER>Ginny</PER> did not seek another one-to-one meeting with <PER>Harry</PER> for the rest of the day, nor by any look or gesture did <PER>Ginny</PER> show that they had shared more than polite conversation in <PER>Ginny</PER>'s room.
As <PER>Harry</PER>’s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow’s kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, several tables were placed end to end in the garden.
Thanks to Molly’s ministrations, George’s wound was neat and clean, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, despite the twins’ many jokes about it.
<PER>Hermione</PER> made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes.
“Nice,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, as with one final flourish of her wand, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold.
“You’ve really got an eye for that sort of thing.” “Thank you, <PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking both pleased and a little confused.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned away, smiling to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a funny notion that <PER>Harry</PER> would find a chapter on compliments when <PER>Harry</PER> found time to peruse <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; <PER>Harry</PER> caught <PER>Ginny</PER>’s eye and grinned at <PER>Ginny</PER>'s before remembering his promise to <PER>Ron</PER> and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour.
Seconds later <PER>Harry</PER> realized that it was <PER>Harry</PER>'s birthday cake, which Molly was suspending with Molly's wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground.
Over ” Molly's shoulder, <PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one.
Although Lupin smiled as he shook <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> looked rather unhappy.
“Six years ter the day since we met, <PER>Harry</PER>, d’yeh remember it?” “Vaguely,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Didn’t you smash down the front door, give <PER>Dudley</PER> a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?” “I forge’ the details,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> chortled.
“All righ’, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “We’re fine,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Here, <PER>Harry</PER> — couldn’ think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck.
As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy and grim.
“Also with Mister <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley and Miss <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.” “Us?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding surprised.
“There will be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur.” <PER>Harry</PER> saw Arthur exchange a worried look with Molly as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood up.
As they led the way back to the house in silence, <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the other two were thinking the same as <PER>Harry</PER> was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts.
Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in here: <PER>Harry</PER> flicked <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the oil lamps as <PER>Harry</PER> entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room.
Scrimgeour sat Scrimgeour in the sagging armchair that Arthur normally occupied, leaving <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> to squeeze side by side onto the sofa.
“I am here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s will.” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at one another.
“Me and <PER>Hermione</PER> too?” “Yes, all of—” But <PER>Harry</PER> interrupted.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was very fond of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as <PER>Harry</PER> knew, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been negligible.
Scrimgeour put Scrimgeour's hand inside Scrimgeour's cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER>.
After squinting at <PER>Ron</PER> for a moment or two, he turned back to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s will.
<PER>Hermione</PER> held the book in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lap and gazed at it.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw that the title was in runes; <PER>Harry</PER> had never learned to read them.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew I liked books,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a thick voice, mopping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s sleeve.
They were wedged together so tightly that <PER>Ron</PER> had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulders.
“ ‘To <PER>Harry</PER> James Potter,’ ” he read, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides contracted with a sudden excitement, “ ‘I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.’ ” As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather feebly, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, answered: <PER>Harry</PER> thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit <PER>Hermione</PER> could not suppress the urge.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together; both considered <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s Quidditch knowledge negligible.
“Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still wondering how <PER>Harry</PER> could appear to touch the Snitch the Snitch without really doing so.
If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read <PER>Hermione</PER>’s mind; <PER>Harry</PER> could practically hear <PER>Hermione</PER>'s brain whirring beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> met the Minister’s yellow eyes and knew <PER>Harry</PER> had no option but to obey.
<PER>Harry</PER> held out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and placed the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into <PER>Harry</PER>’s palm.
Scrimgeour, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> laughed.
“That’s all, then, is it?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, making to prise <PER>Hermione</PER> off the sofa.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> left you a second bequest, Potter.” “What is it?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, excitement rekindling.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both stiffened.
“That does not make it the exclusive property of Potter, whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> may have decided.” Scrimgeour scratched <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s badly shaven cheek, scrutinizing <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Why do you think “ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted to give me the sword?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, struggling to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper.
Scrimgeour limped toward <PER>Harry</PER> and jabbed <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the chest with the point of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand: It singed a hole in <PER>Harry</PER>’s T- shirt like a lit cigarette.
“Oi!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, jumping up and raising his own wand, but <PER>Harry</PER> said, “No!
Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from <PER>Harry</PER>, glancing at the hole he had made in <PER>Harry</PER>’s T-shirt.
After a minute or so she called, “He’s gone!” “What did he want?” Arthur asked, looking around at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> as Molly came hurrying back to them.
“To give us what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have left <PER>Harry</PER> an old Snitch.
“Meet us upstairs,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to <PER>Hermione</PER>, while they helped Molly restore the garden to its normal state.
“After everyone’s gone to bed.” Up in the attic room, <PER>Ron</PER> examined his Deluminator, and <PER>Harry</PER> filled <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder’s Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.’s locket.
“ Muffliato,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, waving <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand in the direction of the stairs.
“And from what they said, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> invented it <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!” “D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he’d left us?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“When Scrimgeour made you take it, <PER>Harry</PER>, I was so sure that something was going to happen!” “Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s pulse quickening as <PER>Harry</PER> raised the Snitch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, gasped, pointing frantically from <PER>Harry</PER> to the Snitch and back again until <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
“That was the one you nearly swallowed!” “Exactly,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and with <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch.
Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanting handwriting that <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s: I open at the close.
“ ‘I open at the close ’ What’s that supposed to mean?” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> shook their heads, looking blank.
“Why did he want <PER>Harry</PER> to have the sword?” “And why couldn’t he just have told me?” <PER>Harry</PER> said quietly.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> expected <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to understand?
“And as for this book,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “The Tales of Beedle the Bard I’ve never even heard of them!” “You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” said <PER>Ron</PER> incredulously.
The circumstance of <PER>Ron</PER> having read a book that <PER>Hermione</PER> had not was unprecedented.
“You must’ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty “<PER>Ron</PER>, you know full well <PER>Harry</PER> and I were brought up by Muggles!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Three o’clock on the following afternoon found <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests.
The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer’s day.
George was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and <PER>Ron</PER> took charge of Arthur’s old Ministry colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to <PER>Harry</PER>’s lot.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: <PER>Hagrid</PER> was causing a certain amount of disruption.
While Arthur repaired the damage and <PER>Hagrid</PER> shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried back to the entrance to find <PER>Ron</PER> face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking wizard.
Slightly cross- eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss, <PER>Harry</PER> wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow.
“<PER>Ron</PER> can laugh,” said Luna serenely as <PER>Harry</PER> led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, “but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.” “Really?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father’s peculiar views.
“You look great!” “Always the tone of surprise,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> smiled.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high heels; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair was sleek and shiny.
“he used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his — ” “Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, while <PER>Harry</PER> roared with laughter.
They were all laughing so much that none of They noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to <PER>Ron</PER> and said, with his eyes on <PER>Hermione</PER>, “You look vunderful.” “Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped shis small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then, feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from <PER>Ron</PER>’s vicinity, offered to show him him's seat.
<PER>Harry</PER> appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: <PER>Harry</PER> was, after all, a famous Quidditch player.
While people were still craning people's necks to get a good look at him, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle.
“Time to sit down,” Fred told <PER>Harry</PER>, “or we’re going to get run over by the bride.” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather pink and <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears were still scarlet.
After a few moments he muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, “Did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard?” <PER>Harry</PER> gave a noncommittal grunt.
“Ooooh!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, swiveling around in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s seat to look at the entrance.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s funeral, now standing in front of Bill and Fleur.
“But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.” <PER>Ginny</PER> glanced around, grinning, winked at <PER>Harry</PER>, then quickly faced the front again.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with <PER>Ginny</PER> in lonely parts of the school grounds.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned and beamed at <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes too were full of tears. "
“Well have time later,” shrugged <PER>Ron</PER>, snatching three butter-beers from a passing tray and handing one to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught <PER>Harry</PER> instead.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked pleasurably flustered, but this time Viktor Krum had not come to compliment <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Krum did not seem to know whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> was making fun of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Gregorovitch!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, and Krum started, but <PER>Harry</PER> was too excited to care; the memory had come back to <PER>Harry</PER> at the sight of Krum’s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tournament.
So <PER>Voldemort</PER> was looking for a celebrated wandmaker, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not have to search far for a reason: It was surely because of what <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had done on the night that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had pursued him across the skies.
“This girl is very nice-looking,” Krum said, recalling <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surroundings.
“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, “is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?” And he strode off, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make <PER>Harry</PER>'s way around the edge of the crowded dance floor.
he wanted to find <PER>Ron</PER>, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but <PER>Ron</PER> was dancing with <PER>Hermione</PER> out in the middle of the floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was now dancing with Fred and George’s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given <PER>Ron</PER>.
Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of <PER>Ron</PER>’s who seemed unsure whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> was <PER>Harry</PER>'s son, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table.
<PER>Harry</PER> cloud of white hair made <PER>Harry</PER> look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez.
<PER>Harry</PER> was vaguely familiar: Racking <PER>Harry</PER>'s brains, <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s obituary.
“Certainly I knew him longest, if you don’t count Aberforth — and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.” “Speaking of the Daily Prophet I don’t know whether you saw, Mister Doge — ?” “Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.” “Elphias, I don’t know whether you saw the interview <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter gave about Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” Doge’s face flooded with angry color.
Perhaps Doge suspected <PER>Harry</PER>’s feelings, for <PER>Harry</PER> looked concerned and hurried on, “<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter is a dreadful — ” But <PER>Harry</PER> was interrupted by a shrill cackle.
“I assure you I was writing from the heart.” “Oh, we all know you worshipped <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; I daresay you’ll still think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was a saint even if it does turn out that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did away with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s Squib sister!” “Muriell” exclaimed Doge.
“Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second class; but naturally Kendra <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t have dreamed of letting Kendra <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s daughter go to a Muggle school — ” “Ariana was delicate!” said Doge desperately.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s sister suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s sister's lack of magic?
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what to think, what to believe: <PER>Harry</PER> wanted the truth, and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story.
Never once, in six years, had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric’s Hollow.
And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never once told <PER>Harry</PER> never bothered to say And why it was so important, <PER>Harry</PER> could not explain even to <PER>Harry</PER>, yet <PER>Harry</PER> felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell <PER>Harry</PER> that they had this place and these experiences in common.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around <PER>Harry</PER>, and did not realize that <PER>Hermione</PER> had appeared out of the crowd until <PER>Hermione</PER> drew up a chair beside him.
“I simply can’t dance anymore,” <PER>Hermione</PER> panted, slipping off one of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoes and rubbing the sole of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s foot.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, are you okay?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know where to begin, but it did not matter.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet and drew <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wands.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> into the panicking crowd.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, where are you?” As they pushed their way across the dance floor, <PER>Harry</PER> saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd; then <PER>Harry</PER> saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of their shout, “Protego\”, a cry that was echoed on all sides — “<PER>Ron</PER>!
<PER>Harry</PER> caught hold of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s free arm, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all him could feel was <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand as <PER>Harry</PER> was squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were still wearing dress robes.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, we haven’t got anything to change into,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him.
“Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, inwardly cursing <PER>Harry</PER>'s own stupidity.
“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, frowning at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which her was now rummaging.
“Yes, they’re here,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s utter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.
“Thank you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, managing a small smile as <PER>Hermione</PER> pushed the robes into the bag.
“Please, <PER>Harry</PER>, get that Cloak on!” <PER>Harry</PER> threw the Invisibility Cloak around <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders and pulled his shoulders up over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, vanishing from sight.
“It’s you they’re after, <PER>Harry</PER>, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.” “She’s right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who seemed to know that <PER>Harry</PER> was about to argue, even if <PER>Harry</PER> could not see <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after everyone.” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded, then remembered that they could not see <PER>Harry</PER>, and said, “Yeah.” But <PER>Harry</PER> thought of <PER>Ginny</PER>, and fear bubbled like acid in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m sure we’re safer out in the Muggle world, it’s not where they’ll expect us to be.” “True,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking around, “but don’t you feel a bit — exposed?” “Where else is there?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, cringing as the men on the other side of the road started wolf- whistling at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped into a booth first and <PER>Ron</PER> sat next to <PER>Harry</PER> opposite <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: She glanced over her shoulder so frequently She appeared to have a twitch.
After a minute or two, <PER>Ron</PER> said, “You know, we’re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing Cross — ” “<PER>Ron</PER>, we can’t!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and <PER>Hermione</PER> ordered two cappuccinos: As <PER>Harry</PER> was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one.
<PER>Hermione</PER> dropped <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice to a whisper.
The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that <PER>Harry</PER> came to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, waved her away.
<PER>Ron</PER>, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing <PER>Hermione</PER> sideways onto her bench.
The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the tiled wall where <PER>Ron</PER>’s head had just been, as <PER>Harry</PER>, still invisible, yelled, “Stupefyl” The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: The great blond Death Eater slumped sideways, unconscious.
His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at <PER>Ron</PER>: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound <PER>Ron</PER> head to foot — the waitress screamed and ran for the door — <PER>Harry</PER> sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up <PER>Ron</PER>, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door.
“Expulsol” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which <PER>Harry</PER> was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed <PER>Harry</PER> into the wall and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand leave <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand as the Cloak slipped off him.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench.
him turned over the darker Death Eater with him's foot; the man’s eyes moved rapidly between <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Lock the door,” he told her, “and <PER>Ron</PER>, turn out the lights.” he looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and <PER>Ron</PER> used the Deluminator to plunge the cafe into darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the men who had jeered at <PER>Hermione</PER> earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance.
“What are we going to do with them?” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER> through the dark; then, even more quietly, “Kill them?
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“Take care of the other one and the waitress while <PER>Ron</PER> and I clear up.” “Clear up?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking around at the partly destroyed cafe.
“It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, <PER>Hermione</PER>, you packed my old jeans, they’re tight.” “Oh, I’m so sorry,” hissed <PER>Hermione</PER>, and as <PER>Hermione</PER> dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mutter a suggestion as to where <PER>Ron</PER> could stick his wand instead.
“How did they know where we were?” <PER>Hermione</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You — you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “<PER>Harry</PER> can’t have,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Don’t be silly, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER> can get in there!” “<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him — and even if they haven’t worked,” <PER>Ron</PER>’s dad pressed on as <PER>Hermione</PER> began to argue, “so what?
Then, on <PER>Harry</PER>’s count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more.
Seconds later <PER>Harry</PER>’s lungs expanded gratefully and <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square.
They raced up the stone steps, and <PER>Harry</PER> tapped the front door once with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“So where are these jinxes they put up against <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> took a step forward.
“We’re not <PER>Snape</PER>!” croaked <PER>Harry</PER>, before something whooshed over <PER>Harry</PER> like cold air and <PER>Harry</PER>'s tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak.
<PER>Ron</PER> was making retching noises; <PER>Hermione</PER> stammered, “That m-must have b- been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for <PER>Snape</PER>!” Gingerly <PER>Harry</PER> took another step forward.
Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible: <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed and so did Mistress Black, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, the gray figure face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, the gray figure raised a wasted arm, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, and though <PER>Harry</PER> had raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand no spell occurred to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers — ” “SHUT UP!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, directing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her.
“That that was ” <PER>Hermione</PER> whimpered, as <PER>Ron</PER> helped her to her feet.
“Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand and said, “Homenum revelio.” Nothing happened.
“Let’s go up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a frightened look at the same spot, and <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor.
<PER>Hermione</PER> waved <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drafty room, <PER>Hermione</PER> perched on the sofa, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arms wrapped tightly around <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And you’d think, if <PER>Harry</PER> still had a Trace on <PER>Harry</PER>, they’d have followed us here.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not <PER>Harry</PER>'s own pound through <PER>Harry</PER>'s body, violent and brief as an electric shock.
“What did you see?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked, advancing on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Did you see <PER>Harry</PER> at my place?” “No, I just felt anger — <PER>Harry</PER>’s really angry — ” “But that could be at the Burrow,” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t want you to use that connection, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted you to shut that connection down, that’s why you were supposed to use Occlumency!
He wished that He had not told them what He had seen and felt; it made <PER>Voldemort</PER> more threatening, as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar was building and <PER>Voldemort</PER> fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick.
He turned He's back on <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> shrieked: <PER>Harry</PER> drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of <PER>Ron</PER>’s father.
<PER>Ron</PER> let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: <PER>Hermione</PER> joined him, gripping him's arm.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” he said over <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder, “I — ” “It’s not a problem,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sickened by the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt sickened by what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, by the use to which <PER>Malfoy</PER> was now being put by <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
There was a sharp rap on the door, and <PER>Harry</PER> jumped as <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice rang out.
A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains: It was the cool, clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s slow, deep breathing.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that <PER>Hermione</PER> sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> The grief that had possessed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> since <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s death felt different now.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> been like <PER>Dudley</PER>, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him?
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of Godric’s Hollow, of graves <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never mentioned there; <PER>Harry</PER> thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s will, and resentment swelled in the darkness.
Why hadn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told n’t graves <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> actually cared about <PER>Harry</PER> at all?
Desperate for something to do, for distraction, <PER>Harry</PER> slipped out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleeping bag, picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and crept out of the room.
<PER>Harry</PER> continued up the stairs until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the topmost landing, where there were only two doors.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never entered <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather’s bedroom before.
A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed’s headboard; a spider’s web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as <PER>Harry</PER> moved deeper into the room, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a scurrying of disturbed mice.
<PER>Harry</PER> could only assume that Sirius’s parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept Sirius’s parents on the wall, because <PER>Harry</PER> was sure Siriusparents would not have appreciated Sirius’s parents's eldest son’s taste in decoration.
There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (<PER>Harry</PER> had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper.
With a leap of pleasure, <PER>Harry</PER> recognized <PER>Harry</PER>'s father; <PER>Harry</PER>'s untidy black hair stuck up at the back like <PER>Harry</PER>’s, and <PER>Harry</PER> too wore glasses.
Beside <PER>Harry</PER> was Sirius, carelessly handsome, him's slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen it alive.
On James’s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding he liked and included or was it simply because <PER>Harry</PER> knew how it had been, that <PER>Harry</PER> saw these things in the picture?
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to take it from the wall; it was <PER>Harry</PER>'s now, after all, Sirius had left <PER>Harry</PER> everything, but it would not budge.
We were so sorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s got to come first, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s not old enough to know it’s <PER>Harry</PER>’s's birthday anyway!
James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, James tries not to show it but I can tell — also, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s still got <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions.
Bathilda drops in most days, Bathilda’s a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I’m not sure <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d be pleased if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew!
I don’t know how much to believe, actually, because it seems incredible that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s extremities seemed to have gone numb.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s stood quite still, holding the miraculous paper in <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s's nerveless fingers while inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s a kind of quiet eruption sent joy and grief thundering in equal measure through <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>’s's veins.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused, pondering <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s words.
<PER>Harry</PER> distinctly remembered <PER>Harry</PER>'s headmaster telling <PER>Harry</PER> years before, “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible.” Perhaps some less gifted Order member had needed Order assistance, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had acted as carrier?
It seems incredible that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — That <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what?
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized papers, treating them, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher; <PER>Harry</PER> pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair.
<PER>Harry</PER> tucked the photograph into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket with Lily’s letter and continued to look for the second sheet.
After another quarter of an hour, however, <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to conclude that the rest of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s letter was gone.
<PER>Hermione</PER> took it and read it while <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Hermione</PER>.
When <PER>Hermione</PER> reached the end of the page <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up at him.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> ” “And there’s this too.” He handed her the torn photograph, and <PER>Hermione</PER> smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom.
“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “but it’s not here.” <PER>Hermione</PER> glanced around.
“I understand why you’d love to talk to her about your mum and dad, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> too,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But that wouldn’t really help us in us search for the Horcruxes, would it?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer, and she rushed on, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I know you really want to go to Godric’s Hollow, but I’m scared, I’m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday.
When he had finished, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Of course, I can see why that’s upset you, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not it’s true or — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter?
She read it, then clutched <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so tightly that <PER>Harry</PER> winced.
“He was a Death Eater,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “Sirius told me about He, He joined up when He was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they killed He.” “That fits!” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“If he was a Death Eater he had access to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring <PER>Voldemort</PER> down!” She released <PER>Harry</PER>, leaned over the banister, and screamed, “<PER>Ron</PER>!
<PER>Hermione</PER> pointed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at the handle and said, “Alohomora.” There was a click, and the door swung open.
“What?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely; <PER>Hermione</PER> was still immersed in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s press clippings.
“He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s where the Seeker Never mind,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, realizing that nobody was listening: <PER>Ron</PER> was on his hands and knees, searching under the wardrobe.
“There’s an easier way,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> wiped <PER>Harry</PER>'s inky fingers on <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans.
“Charms to prevent it being summoned magically, you know.” “Like <PER>Voldemort</PER> put on the stone basin in the cave,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, remembering how <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been unable to Summon the fake locket.
“It could be somewhere else in the house, though,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs: As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had become more discouraged, she seemed to have become more determined.
“There was a locket.” “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
<PER>Ron</PER> groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; <PER>Hermione</PER> closed her eyes.
“It’s not over yet,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice and called, “ Kreacherl” There was a loud crack and the house-elf that <PER>Harry</PER> had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half human-sized, <PER>Harry</PER>'s pale skin hanging off <PER>Harry</PER> in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from <PER>Harry</PER>'s batlike ears.
“Two years ago,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart now hammering against <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs, “there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs.
Then he said, “Yes.” “Where is it now?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> jubilantly as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked gleeful.
“Gone.” “Gone?” echoed <PER>Harry</PER>, elation flooding out of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ — and the locket, Master Regulus’s locket, Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!” <PER>Harry</PER> reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, <PER>Harry</PER> launched <PER>Harry</PER> upon the elf, flattening <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s scream mingled with Kreacher’s, but <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed louder than both of them: “Kreacher, I order you to stay still!” <PER>Harry</PER> felt the elf freeze and released <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let him up!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“So <PER>Harry</PER> can beat <PER>Harry</PER> up with the poker?” snorted <PER>Harry</PER>, kneeling beside the elf.
he said that <PER>Voldemort</PER> required an elf.” “<PER>Voldemort</PER> needed an elf?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, looking around at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked just as puzzled as <PER>Harry</PER> did.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> saw what had happened as clearly as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been present. "
But here, <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination could go no further, for <PER>Harry</PER> could not see how Kreacher had escaped.
Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked at <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s great, bloodshot eyes.
“I know, but — ” “Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“He Disapparated!” “But you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that cave,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “otherwise <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ” “Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
But even as <PER>Voldemort</PER> thought this, <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice was icy.
“Of course, <PER>Voldemort</PER> would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s notice, just like all the purebloods who treat them like animals.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s hands leapt to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth: <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have understood something.
“So you brought the locket home,” <PER>Harry</PER> said relentlessly, for <PER>Harry</PER> was determined to know the full story.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s heels and shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, trying to clear it.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring <PER>Voldemort</PER> down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to <PER>Voldemort</PER>?
““<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what <PER>Voldemort</PER> did to Kreacher wasn’t that far out of the common way.
As <PER>Voldemort</PER> watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, <PER>Voldemort</PER> remembered what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had said to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, mere hours after Sirius’s death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Hermione</PER> for assistance.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, <PER>Harry</PER> could not pretend that it was not an order.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
he then made two low bows to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, and even gave a funny little spasm in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.
If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, <PER>Harry</PER> was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and <PER>Harry</PER> prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation.
By nightfall, <PER>Harry</PER> felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which <PER>Hermione</PER> had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help.
“Death Eaters, for sure,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, as he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched from the drawing room windows.
“Reckon they know we’re in here?” “I don’t think so,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> looked frightened, “or they’d have sent <PER>Snape</PER> in after we, wouldn’t they?” “D’you reckon “D’you’s been in here and had “D’you's tongue tied by Moody’s curse?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
Restless and irritable, <PER>Ron</PER> had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket: This particularly infuriated <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off.
“I don’t know I’m doing it!” “Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?” “What, like reading kids’ stories?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> left me this book, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “ — and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use it!” Unable to stand the bickering, <PER>Harry</PER> slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them.
<PER>Harry</PER> headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which <PER>Harry</PER> kept visiting because <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear.
Every nerve in <PER>Harry</PER>'s body seemed to tauten: <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited.
<PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand into the middle of it.
“Don’t move!” He had forgotten the portrait of Mistress Black: At the sound of He's yell, the curtains hiding her flew open and her began to scream, “Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house — ” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> came crashing down the stairs behind <PER>Harry</PER>, wands pointing, like <PER>Harry</PER>, at the unknown man now standing with <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms raised in the hall below.
“Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!” “Oh, thank goodness,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> weakly, pointing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at Mistress Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell.
<PER>Ron</PER> too lowered his wand, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not.
“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, <PER>Harry</PER>, which takes the form of a stag.” “Oh, all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, lowering <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, “but I had to check, didn’t I?” “Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to check.
“We wondered,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively, “whether <PER>Harry</PER> could still have the Trace on <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Impossible,” said Lupin.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked smug, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt hugely relieved.
“Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure <PER>Harry</PER> was here if <PER>Harry</PER> still had the Trace on <PER>Harry</PER>, wouldn’t they?
<PER>Harry</PER> had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act had been to try to protect <PER>Harry</PER>.
He read the headline over it: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> gave roars of outrage, but <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing.
<PER>Harry</PER> pushed the newspaper away; <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to read any more: <PER>Harry</PER> knew what it would say.
Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died knew who had really killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and, as <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, <PER>Harry</PER> had been seen running from the place moments after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had fallen.
“The official version of Scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.” “Why didn’t <PER>Voldemort</PER> declare himself Minister of Magic?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.” <PER>Ron</PER> glanced at <PER>Hermione</PER>, then said, “What if purebloods and half-bloods swear a Muggle-born’s part of purebloods and half-bloods's family?
“Thank you, <PER>Ron</PER>, but I couldn’t let you — ” “You won’t have a choice,” said <PER>Ron</PER> fiercely, gripping her hand back.
“I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, <PER>Harry</PER>, but the Order is under the impression that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left you a mission.” “He did,” <PER>Harry</PER> replied, “and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> are in on it and they’re coming with me.” “Can you confide in me what the mission is?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that <PER>Harry</PER> could return a different answer.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly, “I’m not.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s eyes swiveled backward and forward from <PER>Harry</PER> to Lupin.
“Don’t say that — how could any child be ashamed of you?” “Oh, I don’t know, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’d be pretty ashamed of him.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know where <PER>Harry</PER>'s rage was coming from, but it had propelled <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet too.
“You fancy stepping into Sirius’s shoes — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” <PER>Hermione</PER> begged <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> continued to glare into Lupin’s livid face.
“The man who taught me to fight dementors — a coward.” Lupin drew The man who taught me to fight dementors's wand so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> had barely reached for <PER>Harry</PER>'s own; there was a loud bang and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> flying backward as if punched; as <PER>Harry</PER> slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed the tail of Lupin’s cloak disappearing around the door.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” wailed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood up; <PER>Harry</PER> could feel a lump swelling where <PER>Harry</PER>'s head had hit the wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still so full of anger <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking.
“No — no — we mustn’t fight!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, launching <PER>Hermione</PER> between them.
“You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>.
Broken images were racing each other through He's mind: Sirius falling through the veil; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mother’s voice, begging for mercy “Parents,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “shouldn’t leave their kids unless — unless their’ve got to.” “<PER>Harry</PER> — ” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, stretching out a consoling hand, but “<PER>Harry</PER> — ” shrugged it off and walked away, “<PER>Harry</PER> — ”'s eyes on the fire <PER>Hermione</PER> had conjured.
Neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure that they were looking at each other behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, communicating silently.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked sympathetic, <PER>Ron</PER> uncertain.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, thinking of <PER>Harry</PER>'s father.
The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s unspoken reproaches.
He was sure that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet He turned a page loudly, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s name leapt out at He.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of photos of Native Americans <PER>Harry</PER>’d seen as <PER>Harry</PER> studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked above the picture and saw the headline: by <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter Thinking that it could hardly make <PER>Harry</PER> feel any worse than <PER>Harry</PER> already did, <PER>Harry</PER> began to read: Proud and haughty, Kendra <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her husband Percival’s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban.
She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s strange escape from <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been wrong: What <PER>Harry</PER> had read had indeed made <PER>Harry</PER> feel worse.
he was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen.
<PER>Harry</PER> immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to <PER>Harry</PER>, croaked, “Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.” Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out Mundungus's wand; <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, was too quick for Mundungus.
<PER>Ron</PER> got up, panting, and watched as <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand deliberately at Mundungus ’s nose.
“Well, you’re a bunch of bleedin’ ’eroes then, aren’t you, but I never pretended I was up for killing meself “We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad- Eye,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, moving <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand a little closer to Mundungus’s baggy, bloodshot eyes.
“When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,” <PER>Harry</PER> began, but Mundungus interrupted <PER>Harry</PER> again.
“Perhaps just one more, Master <PER>Harry</PER>, for luck?” <PER>Ron</PER> laughed.
“Aguamenti\” screamed <PER>Hermione</PER>, and a jet of water streamed from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up and saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s own shock reflected in <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s faces.
<PER>Harry</PER> had nearly lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s balance as <PER>Harry</PER> Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of <PER>Harry</PER>'s momentarily exposed elbow.
He and <PER>Hermione</PER> had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now He and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of them's scattered parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read: “No!” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> loudly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was quickest; <PER>Hermione</PER> snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud.
“Thanks, Kreacher,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face.
“Well, at least we know exactly where <PER>Snape</PER> is now.” <PER>Snape</PER> began to spoon soup into <PER>Snape</PER>'s mouth.
He was sure <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were, or debating how best to undermine <PER>Snape</PER> ’s new regime.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was carrying a large, framed picture, which <PER>Hermione</PER> now lowered to the floor before seizing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard.
“Phineas Nigellus,” <PER>Hermione</PER> explained as <PER>Hermione</PER> threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash.
“Sorry?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> understood.
The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s office at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where <PER>Snape</PER> was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor.
“<PER>Snape</PER> could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for Phineas Nigellus,” <PER>Hermione</PER> explained to <PER>Ron</PER> as she resumed her seat.
“Thank you,” smiled <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling <PER>Hermione</PER>'s soup toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>, what else happened today?” “Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That’s why we haven’t seen <PER>Umbridge</PER>, she’d never walk, she’d think she’s too important.” “And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked.
“How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s soupspoon suspended in midair.
“Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.” “But you never told us that!” <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that her and <PER>Ron</PER> had been examining when <PER>Harry</PER> had entered the kitchen.
<PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s jaw hanging; <PER>Ron</PER> choked a little over his soup.
“You aren’t serious, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was biting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip, deep in thought.
“We know everything important,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on, addressing <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“It’s time to act.” <PER>Harry</PER> could tell from <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s faces that they were scared; <PER>Harry</PER> was not particularly confident <PER>Harry</PER>, and yet <PER>Harry</PER> was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.
“I thought we’d settled this.” “It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” <PER>Ron</PER> jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously.
“Let me know if you ever defeat <PER>Voldemort</PER>, won’t you?” As <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> laughed, pain shot through the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
<PER>Harry</PER> hand jumped to it: <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER>’s eyes narrow, and <PER>Harry</PER> tried to pass off the movement by brushing <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
“Master has not finished Master's soup, would Master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?” “Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute — er — bathroom.” Aware that <PER>Hermione</PER> was watching him suspiciously, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where <PER>Harry</PER> dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again.
Grunting with pain, <PER>Harry</PER> slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
The buildings on either side of <PER>Harry</PER> had high, timbered gables; The buildings on either side of <PER>Harry</PER> looked like gingerbread houses.
<PER>Harry</PER> approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own long-fingered hand against the door.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, open up!” <PER>Harry</PER> had shouted out, <PER>Harry</PER> knew it.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up and unbolted the door; <PER>Hermione</PER> toppled inside at once, regained <PER>Hermione</PER>'s balance, and looked around suspiciously.
<PER>Ron</PER> was right behind her, looking unnerved as <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.
“Oh yeah I must’ve dozed off or — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, please don’t insult our intelligence,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, taking deep breaths.
“So you’re not even going to try to shut <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out?” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, I can’t.
“Would you like it?” “I — no — I’m sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>, I didn’t mean — ” “I hate it, I hate the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> can get inside me, that I have to watch <PER>Harry</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER>’s most dangerous.
“He made Krum’s wand and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.” “But according to you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s got Ollivander locked up somewhere.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you keep talking about what your wand did,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but you made it happen!
As his extinguished his wand, however, his was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; his thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long his could hope to remain hidden while <PER>Voldemort</PER> sought <PER>Voldemort</PER> so determinedly.
“You look terrible,” was <PER>Ron</PER>’s greeting as <PER>Ron</PER>’s entered the room to wake <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that <PER>Harry</PER> associated with exam review.
<PER>Hermione</PER> Disapparated with <PER>Ron</PER> first, then came back for <PER>Harry</PER>.
After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place.
“Right then,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, checking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch.
“And I thought we were supposed to open the door before <PER>Hermione</PER> got here?” <PER>Hermione</PER> squealed.
<PER>Hermione</PER> pulled the door back toward <PER>Hermione</PER>, to make it look as though it was still closed.
“And now,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, turning back to face the other two in the alleyway, “we put on the Cloak again — ” “ — and we wait,” <PER>Ron</PER> finished, throwing it over <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Nicely done, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, emerging from behind a bin beside the theater door as <PER>Harry</PER> took off the Invisibility Cloak.
As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put them on, <PER>Harry</PER> checked <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch.
“We’re running late, Mister Magical Maintenance will be here any second.” They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but <PER>Hermione</PER> remained in view, waiting.
As <PER>Hermione</PER> and the wizard headed for the main road, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> crept along behind them.
Using a repulsed <PER>Hermione</PER> to claw his way back into a standing position, his turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the bag <PER>Ron</PER> had snatched from his hand as his went and some flying chunks of vomit.
“Urgh,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, holding up the skirts of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robe to avoid the puddles of sick.
Finally <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> reappeared.
“We don’t know who he is,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, passing <PER>Harry</PER> several curly black hairs, “but he’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed!
“Blimey, that’s scary,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>, who now towered over him.
“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, “and let’s go, it’s nearly nine.” They stepped out of the alleyway together.
“See you in a moment, then,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> nervously, and <PER>Hermione</PER> tottered off down the steps to LADIES.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white.
“Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?” And he and <PER>Harry</PER> let he and <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> into adjoining cubicles.
“Looks like it,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered back; <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice came out deep and gravelly.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew at once that <PER>Harry</PER> had done the right thing; though <PER>Harry</PER> appeared to be standing in water, <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up clumsily; there was a lot more of <PER>Harry</PER>'s body than <PER>Harry</PER> was accustomed to.
<PER>Harry</PER> received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You got in all right, then?” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered theirs, but nobody followed theirs: It was as if theirs were infectious.
“If I don’t turn up, my wife — I mean, Cattermole ’s wife — ” “Well come with you, we should stick together — ” began <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head feverishly.
He glanced over at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as the lift creaked upward once more; <PER>Hermione</PER> was now whispering frantic instructions to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> give <PER>Ron</PER> a little push and <PER>Harry</PER> hurried out of the lift, followed by the other wizards, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone.
The moment the golden door had closed <PER>Hermione</PER> said, very fast, “Actually, <PER>Harry</PER>, I think I’d better go after him, I don’t think him knows what him’s doing and if him gets caught the whole thing — ” “Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.” The golden grilles slid apart again and <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped.
“Ah, Mafalda!” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Glancing over his shoulder, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER>’s anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of her, <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder.
“Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat dry.
The moment the Minister had passed out of sight, <PER>Harry</PER> tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under <PER>Harry</PER>'s heavy black cloak, threw it over <PER>Harry</PER>, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction.
Runcorn was so tall that <PER>Harry</PER> was forced to stoop to make sure <PER>Harry</PER>'s big feet were hidden.
As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner’s name and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force its upon he so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish.
the plan he had been carefully concocting with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish had concentrated all the plan he had been carefully concocting with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish's efforts on getting inside without being detected: They had not given a moment’s thought to what They would do if They were forced to separate.
Now <PER>Hermione</PER> was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; <PER>Ron</PER> was struggling to do magic that <PER>Harry</PER> was sure was beyond <PER>Harry</PER>, a woman’s liberty possibly depending on the outcome; and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift.
After a few seconds, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the same pattern; and after a few more seconds <PER>Harry</PER> realized that what <PER>Harry</PER> was watching was the creation of pamphlets — that the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard.
<PER>Harry</PER> crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what the workers were doing that <PER>Harry</PER> doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and <PER>Harry</PER> slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch.
“What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?” The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; <PER>Harry</PER> looked too, and rage reared in <PER>Harry</PER> like a snake.
For a split second <PER>Harry</PER> forgot where <PER>Harry</PER> was and what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing there: <PER>Harry</PER> even forgot that <PER>Harry</PER> was invisible.
The plaque beneath it read: Below that, a slightly shinier new plaque read: <PER>Harry</PER> looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though the dozen pamphlet-makers were intent upon the dozen pamphlet-makers's work, <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly suppose that the dozen pamphlet-makers would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them.
A few moments later, during which <PER>Harry</PER> waited with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned the doorknob, stepped into <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office, and closed the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> had stepped back in time.
<PER>Harry</PER> wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of the telescope, and placed the telescope in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> turned to face the room again, raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and murmured, “Accio Locket.” Nothing happened, but <PER>Harry</PER> had not expected it to; no doubt <PER>Umbridge</PER> knew all about protective charms and spells.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved across to read it and saw that <PER>Umbridge</PER> had written, “To be punished.” Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was staring at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk.
<PER>Harry</PER> crossed the room at a run and snatched the room up, but realized the moment <PER>Harry</PER> touched it that it was not a mirror at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across <PER>Harry</PER>'s hat — The Life and Lies ofAlbus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — nor the slightly smaller writing across <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest: “by <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?” <PER>Harry</PER> opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with both's arms around each other’s shoulders.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum’s chin that had so annoyed <PER>Ron</PER>.
The boy who roared in silent amusement beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had a gleeful, wild look about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The boy who roared in silent amusement beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER> golden hair fell in curls to The boy who roared in silent amusement beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s shoulders.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether it was a young Doge, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could check the caption, the door of the office opened.
If Thicknesse had not been looking over Thicknesse's shoulder as Thicknesse entered, <PER>Harry</PER> would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over <PER>Harry</PER>.
As it was, <PER>Harry</PER> thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two <PER>Harry</PER> remained quite still, staring curiously at the place where <PER>Harry</PER> had just vanished.
Perhaps deciding that all <PER>Harry</PER> had seen was <PER>Dumbledore</PER> scratching <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s nose on the front of the book, for <PER>Harry</PER> had hastily replaced it upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed Thicknesse's wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they’re so careless, remember that poisonous duck?” Speeding back toward the lifts, <PER>Harry</PER> reviewed his options.
The first thing to do was to find <PER>Ron</PER>, and then they could work out a way of extracting <PER>Hermione</PER> from the courtroom.
To <PER>Harry</PER>'s enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-eyed <PER>Ron</PER> got in.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, it’s me, <PER>Harry</PER>!” “<PER>Harry</PER>!
He addressed Arthur’s shoulder, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure <PER>Harry</PER> was scared that <PER>Harry</PER>'s father might recognize <PER>Harry</PER> if they looked directly into each other’s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> made to follow him, but found <PER>Harry</PER>'s path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose buried in some papers he was reading.
For the second time, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to get out, but this time found <PER>Harry</PER>'s way blocked by Arthur’s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> decided <PER>Harry</PER>'s best chance was to act stupid.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> was impersonating somebody other than Runcorn.
<PER>Harry</PER> would try to extricate <PER>Hermione</PER> on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own while <PER>Ron</PER> was dealing with the raining office.
<PER>Harry</PER> set off, <PER>Harry</PER>'s destination not the black door, but the doorway <PER>Harry</PER> remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers.
<PER>Harry</PER> mind grappled with possibilities as <PER>Harry</PER> crept down them: <PER>Harry</PER> still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with Mafalda?
Of course, <PER>Harry</PER> did not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this, and even if <PER>Harry</PER> managed it, <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they were clear of the Ministry .
Lost in thought, <PER>Harry</PER> did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over <PER>Harry</PER>, as if <PER>Harry</PER> were descending into fog.
It was becoming colder and colder with every step <PER>Harry</PER> took: a cold that reached right down into <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat and tore at <PER>Harry</PER>'s lungs.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, filling <PER>Harry</PER>, expanding inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
So he moved forward as silently as he could, and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced he to think of <PER>Hermione</PER> and of <PER>Ron</PER>, who needed he.
<PER>Harry</PER> did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because <PER>Harry</PER> hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, <PER>Harry</PER> slipped into the courtroom behind her.
Here, behind a balustrade, sat <PER>Umbridge</PER>, with Yaxley on one side of her, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, quite as white-faced as Mistress Cattermole, on the other.
“I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!” <PER>Umbridge</PER> ignored <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind <PER>Umbridge</PER>, Yaxley, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, taking a seat behind the latter.
He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon <PER>Umbridge</PER> and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause <PER>Hermione</PER> alarm.
Then <PER>Umbridge</PER> raised her voice to address Mistress Cattermole, and <PER>Harry</PER> seized his chance.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> laughed a soft girlish laugh that made <PER>Harry</PER> want to attack her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had seen it; <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a little squeak, but <PER>Umbridge</PER> and Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else.
<PER>Hermione</PER> fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside <PER>Hermione</PER>, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mistress Cattermole’s name on it.
It was <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s lie that brought the blood surging into <PER>Harry</PER>’s brain and obliterated <PER>Harry</PER>'s sense of caution — that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster shis own pure-blood credentials.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, Mistress Cattermole!” <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the dementors had moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint.
“Get the Horcrux,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, how do I get rid of these chains?” “Wait, I’m trying something up here — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, we’re surrounded by dementors!” “I know that, <PER>Harry</PER>, but if she wakes up and the locket’s gone — I need to duplicate it — Geminio\ There That should fool her.
“As many as we can muster; do yours, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “Expec — Expecto patronum,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“C’mon,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> led <PER>Hermione</PER> and Mistress Cattermole to the door.
“Runcorn let me out, he attacked <PER>Umbridge</PER> and Yaxley, and he’s told all of us to leave the country, I think us’d better do it, Reg, I really do, let’s hurry home and fetch the children and — why are you so wet?” “Water,” muttered <PER>Ron</PER>, disengaging himself.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, they know there are intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office door, I reckon we’ve got five minutes if that — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s Patronus vanished with a pop as <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s Patronus turned a horror-struck face to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, if we’re trapped here — !” “We won’t be if we move fast,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> addressed the silent group behind them, who were all gawping at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” squeaked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Follow me,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered to the group of terrified Muggle-borns, who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I didn’t mean nothing, Albert, but I thought I thought they were in for questioning and ” “they blood is pure,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s deep voice echoed impressively through the hall.
As the balding wizard lifted his wand, <PER>Harry</PER> raised an enormous fist and punched <PER>Harry</PER>, sending <PER>Harry</PER> flying through the air.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“Come on!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted at <PER>Hermione</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> flung open the door; <PER>Ron</PER> was standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mistress Cattermole.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Hermione</PER> by the hand and <PER>Ron</PER> by the arm and turned on the spot.
his wondered whether his was going to suffocate; his could not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s fingers, which were slowly slipping away .
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea what had happened, <PER>Harry</PER> only knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs.
Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened, <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above <PER>Harry</PER>.
Looking around, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they and <PER>Hermione</PER> were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though <PER>Harry</PER> knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut.
However, in the few moments it took for <PER>Ron</PER> to give a low groan and <PER>Harry</PER> to start crawling toward him, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that this was not the Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, The trees were more widely spaced, the ground clearer.
<PER>Harry</PER> met <PER>Hermione</PER>, also on her hands and knees, at <PER>Ron</PER>’s head.
The moment his eyes fell upon <PER>Ron</PER>, all other concerns fled <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, for blood drenched the whole of <PER>Ron</PER>’s left side and <PER>Ron</PER>’s's face stood out, grayish- white, against the leaf-strewn earth.
“What’s happened to him?” “Splinched,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her fingers already busy at <PER>Ron</PER>’s sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched, horrified, as she tore open <PER>Ron</PER>’s shirt.
<PER>Harry</PER> had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this <PER>Harry</PER> insides crawled unpleasantly as <PER>Hermione</PER> laid bare <PER>Ron</PER>’s upper arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany’ — ” “Bag — right — ” <PER>Harry</PER> sped to the place where <PER>Hermione</PER> had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand inside it.
“Accio Dittany\” A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught A small brown bottle and hastened back to <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids.
“Unstopper it for me, <PER>Harry</PER>, my hands are shaking.” <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, <PER>Hermione</PER> took the stopper and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think <PER>Harry</PER> can.
With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, <PER>Harry</PER> imagined the house-elf busying <PER>Harry</PER> over the steak-and-kidney pie that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> would never eat.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> had stuck it to <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s office door, to spy on people.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> was still gray and “<PER>Umbridge</PER>'s face glistened with sweat.
“I wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was — ” “ — the first place you thought of,” <PER>Harry</PER> finished for <PER>Hermione</PER>, glancing around at the apparently deserted glade.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place <PER>Hermione</PER> had thought of — how Death Eaters had found them within minutes.
Did <PER>Voldemort</PER> or his henchmen know, even now, where <PER>Hermione</PER> had taken henchmen?
“D’you reckon we should move on?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell by the look on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face that he was thinking the same.
Looking relieved, <PER>Hermione</PER> sprang to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet.
“If we’re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,” she replied, and raising shis wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, murmuring incantations as she went.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if <PER>Hermione</PER> had cast a heat haze upon their clearing.
“Apparently <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want it back, <PER>Harry</PER>'s lumbago’s so bad,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand, “so <PER>Ron</PER>’s dad said I could borrow it.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other.
“I’m sorry,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, moaning a little as <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER> to look at them, “but it feels like a — a jinx or something.
“In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling You-Know- Who by his name didn’t do <PER>Dumbledore</PER> much good in the end,” <PER>Ron</PER> snapped back.
“Just — just show You- Know-Who some respect, will you?” “Respect?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, but <PER>Hermione</PER> shot <PER>Harry</PER> a warning look; apparently <PER>Harry</PER> was not to argue with <PER>Ron</PER> while the latter was in such a weakened condition.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> half carried, half dragged <PER>Ron</PER> through the entrance of the tent.
<PER>Harry</PER> shoved aside an old armchair and lowered <PER>Ron</PER> carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed.
Even this very short journey had turned <PER>Ron</PER> whiter still, and once they had settled <PER>Harry</PER> on the mattress <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes again and did not speak for a while.
“I’ll make some tea,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag and heading toward the kitchen.
<PER>Harry</PER> found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
“What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?” “With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, clutching <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hot mug for comfort.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was watching <PER>Ron</PER> fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s expression that <PER>Harry</PER> felt almost as if <PER>Harry</PER> had surprised her in the act of kissing <PER>Harry</PER>.
“So, have you got it?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked her, partly to remind her that <PER>Harry</PER> was there.
“There ’d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.” <PER>Hermione</PER> passed it had been magically destroyed.” to <PER>Harry</PER>, who turned it over in his fingers.
He handed the locket back to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, each of whom did each of whom's best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been.
“What d’you mean?” <PER>Ron</PER> passed the Horcrux to <PER>Harry</PER>.
After a moment or two, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Ron</PER> meant.
“Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it,” <PER>Harry</PER> replied, and, little though <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to, <PER>Harry</PER> hung the chain around <PER>Harry</PER>'s own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where the locket rested against the locket] chest beside the pouch <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given him.
With the Sneakoscope <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> for <PER>Harry</PER>'s birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout.
Evening brought no change; <PER>Harry</PER> lit <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand as he swapped places with <PER>Hermione</PER> at ten o’clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had not packed any food in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s magical bag, as <PER>Hermione</PER> had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that <PER>Hermione</PER> had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan.
After a couple of mouthfuls <PER>Ron</PER> had pushed his portion away, looking queasy; <PER>Harry</PER> had only persevered so as not to hurt <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s feelings.
The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs: <PER>Harry</PER> thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, yet <PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held tight at the ready.
<PER>Harry</PER> had thought that <PER>Harry</PER> would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but somehow <PER>Harry</PER> did not; all <PER>Harry</PER> felt as <PER>Harry</PER> sat looking out at the darkness, of which <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next.
From time to time <PER>Harry</PER> thought, or perhaps imagined, that <PER>Harry</PER> could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
Nameless forebodings crept upon <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> sat there in the dark: <PER>Harry</PER> tried to resist them, push them away, yet them came at <PER>Harry</PER> relentlessly.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, now talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: him could not.
And it seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> sat there trying to master <PER>Harry</PER>'s own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time <PER>Harry</PER> had left.
Stupid idea, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, don’t think that.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward <PER>Harry</PER> in the past month, that <PER>Harry</PER> would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen?
Sick images swarmed into <PER>Harry</PER>’s head and he tried to push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher: he and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already decided against trying to summon he; what if someone from the Ministry came too?
Sick images swarmed into <PER>Harry</PER>’s head and <PER>Harry</PER>’s tried to push these away too, for there was nothing <PER>Harry</PER>’s could do for Kreacher: <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already decided against trying to summon <PER>Harry</PER>’s; what if someone from the Ministry came too could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s sleeve.
<PER>Snape</PER>, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had fallen fallen “ Give it to me, Gregorovitch.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s voice was high, clear, and cold, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held in front of <PER>Harry</PER> by a long-fingered white hand.
In the split second that the lantern’s light illuminated him, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the delight upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a crow of laughter.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind, then!” “I didn’t mean it to happen!” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“He’s found Gregorovitch, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I think He’s killed He, but before He killed He He read Gregorovitch ’s mind and I saw — ” “I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re falling asleep,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> coldly.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; <PER>Harry</PER> climbed into the one above <PER>Harry</PER>, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling.
After several moments, <PER>Ron</PER> spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to <PER>Hermione</PER>, huddled in the entrance.
“What’s <PER>Voldemort</PER> doing?” <PER>Harry</PER> screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered into the darkness.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had said nothing about <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, nothing about the twin cores, nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
“<PER>Harry</PER> wanted something from Gregorovitch,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, eyes still closed tight.
“<PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from <PER>Harry</PER> and then then ” Gregorovitch remembered how Gregorovitch, as <PER>Voldemort</PER>, had seemed to hurtle through Gregorovitch ’s eyes, into <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s memories.
The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all <PER>Harry</PER> could hear was <PER>Ron</PER>’s breathing.
After a while, <PER>Ron</PER> whispered, “Couldn’t you see what the thief was holding?” “No it must’ve been something small.” “<PER>Harry</PER>?” The wooden slats of <PER>Ron</PER>’s bunk creaked as he repositioned he in bed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you don’t reckon <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s after something else to turn into a Horcrux?” “I don’t know,” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly.
He had been sure that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin cores, sure that <PER>Voldemort</PER> sought a solution from the old wandmaker and yet He had killed <PER>Voldemort</PER>, apparently without asking <PER>Voldemort</PER> a single question about wandlore.
him had soared from the windowsill like a bird, and <PER>Harry</PER> had seen him before, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not think where.
With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and it was on him that <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts dwelled, as <PER>Ron</PER>’s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more.
Early next morning, before the other two were awake, <PER>Harry</PER> left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree <PER>Harry</PER> could find.
It was not much, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s door.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and <PER>Ron</PER> agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took they within reach of a bacon sandwich.
<PER>Hermione</PER> therefore removed the enchantments <PER>Hermione</PER> had placed around the clearing, while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there.
“But you can make a brilliant Patronus!” protested <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> arrived back at the tent empty- handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors.
“I couldn’t make one,” <PER>Harry</PER> panted, clutching the stitch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
It had taken all <PER>Harry</PER>’s willpower to uproot <PER>Harry</PER> from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair them cast wherever them went.
“So we still haven’t got any food.” “Shut up, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was afraid that something had gone wrong inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed!” “That’s convenient.” “And what’s that supposed to — ?” “Of course!” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, clapping a hand to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s forehead and startling both of them into silence.
The moment it parted contact with <PER>Harry</PER>’s skin <PER>Harry</PER> felt free and oddly light.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not even realized that <PER>Harry</PER> was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach until both sensations lifted.
“If we lose it, if it gets stolen — ” “Oh, all right, all right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> placed it around <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own neck and tucked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own neck out of sight down the front of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shirt.
“But we’ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.” “Great,” said <PER>Ron</PER> irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that out, can we please get some food?” “Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with half a glance at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was least surprised by this, because <PER>Harry</PER> had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys’.
<PER>Hermione</PER> bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s silences rather dour.
his did not seem to have any ideas his, but expected <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to come up with plans while his sat and brooded over the low food supplies.
Accordingly <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> spent fruitless hours trying to decide where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had already got, <PER>Harry</PER>'s conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had no new information.
As <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> that he believed <PER>Voldemort</PER> had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had lived or visited.
Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, <PER>Harry</PER> plowed on, “I still reckon <PER>Harry</PER> might have hidden something at Hogwarts.” <PER>Hermione</PER> sighed.
“But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have found it, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated the argument <PER>Harry</PER> kept bringing out in favor of this theory.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said in front of me that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> never assumed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew all of Hogwarts’s secrets.
“If there was one place that was really important to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, it was Hogwarts!” “Oh, come on,” scoffed <PER>Ron</PER>.
His was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around His's neck: <PER>Harry</PER> was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You told us that <PER>Voldemort</PER> asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to give him a job after he left,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably another founder’s object, to make into another Horcrux?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t get the job, did <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“So <PER>Harry</PER> never got the chance to find a founder’s object there and hide a founder’s object there in the school!” “Okay, then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, defeated.
He had known it all along: The orphanage had been the place <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been determined to escape; <PER>Voldemort</PER> would never have hidden a part of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s soul there.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had shown <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Voldemort</PER> sought grandeur or mystique in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, with its golden doors and marble floors.
It happened most often, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, when <PER>Harry</PER> was wearing the Horcrux.
Sometimes <PER>Harry</PER> could not stop <PER>Harry</PER> reacting to the pain.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Ron</PER> was hoping to hear news of <PER>Harry</PER>'s family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was not a television aerial; <PER>Harry</PER> could only see what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took <PER>Harry</PER>'s fancy.
Apparently <PER>Voldemort</PER> was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure, <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew no better than <PER>Voldemort</PER> did.
As <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s memory, <PER>Harry</PER> learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief.
As the days stretched into weeks, <PER>Harry</PER> began to suspect that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were having conversations without, and about, him.
Several times they stopped talking abruptly when <PER>Harry</PER> entered the tent, and twice <PER>Harry</PER> came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; Several times they fell silent when they realized <PER>Harry</PER> was approaching they and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought <PER>Harry</PER> had some secret plan that they would learn in due course.
<PER>Ron</PER> was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to fear that <PER>Hermione</PER> too was disappointed by <PER>Harry</PER>'s poor leadership.
The fact that <PER>Hermione</PER> was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for identifying edible fungi's continuing isolation, the lack of other people’s company, or identifying edible fungi's total ignorance of what was going on in the war against <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced automatically at <PER>Ron</PER>’s neck and saw, as <PER>Harry</PER> had expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there.
<PER>Harry</PER> managed to fight down the impulse to swear at <PER>Ron</PER>, whose attitude would, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket.
<PER>Hermione</PER> jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off <PER>Hermione</PER>'s tin plate onto the floor.
“ You can do the cooking tomorrow, <PER>Ron</PER>, you can find the ingredients and try and charm the ingredients into something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you — ” “Shut up!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, leaping to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and holding up both hands.
<PER>Hermione</PER> snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment <PER>Hermione</PER> drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh- colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance.
<PER>Harry</PER> pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into <PER>Harry</PER>'s own: Over the murmur of the river <PER>Harry</PER> could make out more voices, but more voices were not speaking English or any human language <PER>Harry</PER> had ever heard.
“Here, Griphook, Gornuk.” Goblins\ <PER>Hermione</PER> mouthed at <PER>Harry</PER>, who nodded.
Inside the tent <PER>Harry</PER>’s breathing was shallow with excitement: <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at each other, listening as hard as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> could.
“About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of <PER>Snape</PER> ’s office at Hogwarts?” An electric current seemed to course through <PER>Harry</PER>, jangling <PER>Harry</PER>'s every nerve as <PER>Harry</PER> stood rooted to the spot.
Inside the tent, <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, willing someone to ask the question <PER>Harry</PER> needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged; <PER>Harry</PER> was (<PER>Harry</PER> remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s too.
“You believe <PER>Snape</PER> killed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “ ’Course I do,” said Ted.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> reeled in the Extendable Ears.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more than, “<PER>Ginny</PER> — the sword — ” “I know!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arm in it right up to the armpit.
As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bag, <PER>Hermione</PER> kept <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment.
“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office,” she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, “Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, “Phineas Nigellus hangs right beside the case!” “Unless he was asleep,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but he still held <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath as <PER>Hermione</PER> knelt down in front of the empty canvas, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said: “Er — Phineas?
“That sword isn’t <PER>Snape</PER>’s.” “It belongs to Professor <PER>Snape</PER>’s school,” said Phineas Nigellus.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, <PER>Hagrid</PER>.” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s not an oaf!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrilly.
“And Professor <PER>Snape</PER> might’ve thought that was a punishment,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna probably had a good laugh with <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s portrait — couldn’t you bring <PER>Dumbledore</PER> along, here, into yours?” Phineas Nigellus turned <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face in the direction of <PER>Harry</PER>’s voice.
“I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave the sword of Gryffindor case was when Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> used it to break open a ring.” <PER>Hermione</PER> whipped around to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER> has more important things on Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s mind than the many eccentricities of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s portrait back into the beaded bag; when <PER>Hermione</PER> had fastened the clasp <PER>Hermione</PER> threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Why hadn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told n’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
Or had <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, in fact, told <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had not realized it at the time?
“Nobody ever goes in there.” “But <PER>Snape</PER> knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusted <PER>Snape</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> reminded her.
“Not enough to tell <PER>Harry</PER> that him had swapped the swords,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Yeah, you’re right!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt even more cheered at the thought that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had had some reservations, however faint, about <PER>Snape</PER> ’s trustworthiness.
For one bewildered moment he thought that <PER>Ron</PER> had left the tent, then realized that <PER>Ron</PER> was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk, looking stony.
Dread doused <PER>Harry</PER>’s jubilation: <PER>Ron</PER> was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared he to be thinking.
“We thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told you what to do, We thought you had a real plan!” “<PER>Ron</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ignored <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“So why are you still here?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>, and he took several steps toward <PER>Harry</PER>, who did not back away.
“Go back to them, pretend you’ve got over your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and — ” <PER>Ron</PER> made a sudden movement: <PER>Harry</PER> reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner’s pocket, <PER>Hermione</PER> had raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own.
“Protego\” Protego\ cried, and an invisible shield expanded between Protego\'s and <PER>Harry</PER> on the one side and <PER>Ron</PER> on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a corrosive hatred toward <PER>Ron</PER>: Something had broken between them.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling <PER>Ron</PER>’s name amongst the trees.
<PER>Harry</PER> stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around <PER>Harry</PER>'s own neck.
He dragged blankets off <PER>Ron</PER>’s bunk and threw them over <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Then <PER>Ron</PER>’s climbed onto <PER>Ron</PER>’s's own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.
When <PER>Harry</PER> woke the following day it was several seconds before <PER>Harry</PER> remembered what had happened.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> hoped, childishly, that it had been a dream, that <PER>Ron</PER> was still there and had never left.
<PER>Harry</PER> jumped down from <PER>Harry</PER>'s own bed, keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes averted from <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish <PER>Harry</PER> good morning, but turned her face away quickly as he went by.
he’s gone, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to keep thinking it as <PER>Harry</PER> washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull the shock of it.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s gone and <PER>Harry</PER>’s not coming back.
And that was the simple truth of it, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible, once they vacated this spot, for <PER>Ron</PER> to find them again.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank; several times <PER>Harry</PER> saw shis look up eagerly, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure she had deluded she into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees.
Every time <PER>Harry</PER> imitated she, looked around (for <PER>Harry</PER> could not help hoping a little, <PER>Harry</PER>) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another little parcel of fury exploded inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Ron</PER> saying, “ We thought you knew what you were doing \” , and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach.
Finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay: <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> grasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside.
The instant they arrived, <PER>Hermione</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and walked away from <PER>Harry</PER>, finally sitting down on a large rock, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knees, shaking with what <PER>Harry</PER> knew were sobs.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched her, supposing that <PER>Harry</PER> ought to go and comfort her, but something kept <PER>Harry</PER> rooted to the spot.
Everything inside <PER>Harry</PER> felt cold and tight: Again <PER>Harry</PER> saw the contemptuous expression on <PER>Ron</PER>’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught <PER>Hermione</PER> at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection.
<PER>Harry</PER> was determined never to mention <PER>Harry</PER>'s name again, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear shis crying.
<PER>Harry</PER> was waiting for the moment when <PER>Ron</PER>’s labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that <PER>Harry</PER> had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by <PER>Harry</PER>'s status of pureblood.
However, <PER>Ron</PER> did not appear on the map, and after a while <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> taking it out simply to stare at <PER>Ginny</PER>’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which <PER>Harry</PER> gazed at it might break into her sleep, that her would somehow know <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking about her, hoping that her was all right.
Cudgel his brains though his might, <PER>Harry</PER> could not remember <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ever mentioning a place in which <PER>Harry</PER> might hide something.
There were moments when <PER>Harry</PER> did not know whether <PER>Harry</PER> was angrier with <PER>Ron</PER> or with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with virtually nothing.
him knew nothing, him had no ideas, and him was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indication that <PER>Hermione</PER> too was about to tell him that <PER>Hermione</PER> had had enough, that <PER>Hermione</PER> was leaving.
They were spending many evenings in near silence, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus’s portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by <PER>Ron</PER>’s departure.
<PER>Harry</PER> was even glad to see <PER>Harry</PER>, because <PER>Harry</PER> was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind.
Phineas Nigellus venerated <PER>Snape</PER>, the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about <PER>Snape</PER>, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting.
<PER>Snape</PER> had reinstated <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies.
From all of these things, <PER>Harry</PER> deduced that <PER>Ginny</PER>, and probably <PER>Neville</PER> and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army.
This scant news made <PER>Harry</PER> want to see <PER>Ginny</PER> so badly it felt like a stomachache; but This scant news also made <PER>Harry</PER> think of <PER>Ron</PER> again, and of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and of Hogwarts itself, which <PER>Harry</PER> missed nearly as much as <PER>Harry</PER>'s ex-girlfriend.
Indeed, as Phineas Nigellus talked about <PER>Snape</PER> ’s crackdown, <PER>Harry</PER> experienced a split second of madness when <PER>Harry</PER> imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of <PER>Snape</PER>’s regime: Being fed, and having a soft bed, and other people being in charge, seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment.
But then <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic.
Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s whereabouts.
They had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when <PER>Harry</PER> resolved to suggest, again, what seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> the only unexplored avenue left to They.
They had just eaten an unusually good meal: <PER>Hermione</PER> had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as <PER>Hermione</PER> left), and <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Hermione</PER> might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.
<PER>Harry</PER> had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours’ break from wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> cleared <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt exactly as <PER>Harry</PER> had done on the occasion, several years previously, when <PER>Harry</PER> had asked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> whether Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I’ve been thinking, and — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, could you help me with something?” Apparently <PER>Hermione</PER> had not been listening to “<PER>Harry</PER>.
Above what <PER>Harry</PER> assumed was the title of the story (being unable to read runes, <PER>Harry</PER> could not be sure) , there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.
It was a sticky moment: <PER>Harry</PER> knew that she had sensed <PER>Ron</PER>’s name in the offing.
<PER>Harry</PER> rushed on: “She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.” “Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured <PER>Hermione</PER>, running Shis index finger over Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic.
“Well, I suppose She gasped so dramatically that <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides turned over; <PER>Harry</PER> drew <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there.
If so, <PER>Harry</PER> felt that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left a great deal to chance: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda.
Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with <PER>Harry</PER>’s dearest wish.
It was in Godric’s Hollow that, but for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER> would have grown up and spent every school holiday.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> could have invited friends to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s house.
After <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone to bed that night, <PER>Harry</PER> quietly extracted <PER>Harry</PER>'s rucksack from <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> so long ago.
For the first time in months, <PER>Harry</PER> perused the old pictures of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents, smiling and waving up at <PER>Harry</PER> from the images, which were all <PER>Harry</PER> had left of them now.
<PER>Harry</PER> would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow the following day, but <PER>Hermione</PER> had other ideas.
Convinced as <PER>Hermione</PER> was that <PER>Voldemort</PER> would expect <PER>Harry</PER> to return to the scene of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible.
They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, <PER>Harry</PER> transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man, <PER>Hermione</PER> into his small and rather mousy wife.
The beaded bag containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which <PER>Harry</PER> was wearing around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck) was tucked into an inside pocket of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s buttoned-up coat.
Heart beating in his throat, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front porches, wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> remembered any of them, knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that <PER>Harry</PER> had been little more than a year old when <PER>Harry</PER> had left this place forever.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not even sure whether <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to see the cottage at all; <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Perhaps <PER>Hermione</PER> knew how he was feeling, because <PER>Hermione</PER> reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling he forward.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, look!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was pointing at the war memorial.
<PER>Harry</PER> drew closer, gazing up into <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ faces.
How strange it was to see <PER>Harry</PER> represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
It made <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat constrict, it reminded <PER>Harry</PER> so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor, of the Great Hall’s twelve Christmas trees, of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of <PER>Ron</PER> in a hand-knitted sweater .
“<PER>Harry</PER>, here!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, his heart positively banging in his chest.
So <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter and Muriel had got some of <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter and Muriel's facts right.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help thinking that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ought to have told <PER>Harry</PER> so, yet <PER>Harry</PER> had never thought to share the connection.
They could have visited the place together; for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> imagined coming here with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to <PER>Harry</PER>.
But it seemed that to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted <PER>Harry</PER> to do.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was glad that <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was hidden in shadow.
Surely <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had chosen them, as the eldest member of the family once <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mother had died.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> curtly, then, “let’s keep looking,” and <PER>Harry</PER> turned away, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen the stone: <PER>Harry</PER> did not want <PER>Harry</PER>'s excited trepidation tainted with resentment.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come back a moment.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way back through the snow toward her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> showed <PER>Harry</PER> the symbol beneath it.
Deeper and deeper amongst the graves <PER>Harry</PER> went, and every time <PER>Harry</PER> reached a new headstone <PER>Harry</PER> felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, they’re here right here.” And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on He's chest, the same sensation He had had right after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had died, a grief that had actually weighed on He's heart and lungs.
<PER>Harry</PER> read the words slowly, as though <PER>Harry</PER> would have only one chance to take in their meaning, and <PER>Harry</PER> read the last of their aloud.
But <PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, moved wand in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught it and laid it on <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ grave.
As soon as <PER>Harry</PER> stood up <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to leave: <PER>Harry</PER> did not think <PER>Harry</PER> could stand another moment there.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm around <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulders, and <PER>Hermione</PER> put hers around <PER>Harry</PER>'s waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring <PER>Hermione</PER>, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement.
For a moment <PER>Harry</PER> considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could say anything <PER>Hermione</PER> murmured, “Let’s go this way,” and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered.
Next moment He had sped up, dragging <PER>Hermione</PER> along with He; <PER>Hermione</PER> slipped a little on the ice.
The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since <PER>Hagrid</PER> had taken <PER>Harry</PER> from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it.
<PER>Harry</PER> was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew instinctively that she would not.
<PER>Hermione</PER> moved closer to him under the Cloak, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arm pressed against him.
<PER>Harry</PER> could think of many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet <PER>Harry</PER>'s suspicions about The woman's identity were growing stronger every moment that identity stood facing each other in the deserted street.
That <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told shis to wait, and that <PER>Harry</PER> would come in the end?
Finally <PER>Harry</PER> spoke, causing <PER>Hermione</PER> to gasp and jump.
Beneath the Cloak <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyebrows; <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a tiny, nervous nod.
She smelled bad, or perhaps it was Shis house: <PER>Harry</PER> wrinkled <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> became aware of the locket against <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; <PER>Harry</PER> could feel it pulsing through the cold gold.
Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing <PER>Hermione</PER> aside as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had not seen <PER>Hermione</PER>, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m not sure about this,” breathed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Look at the size of <PER>Hermione</PER>; I think we could overpower <PER>Hermione</PER>'s if we had to,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> jumped and clutched <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
“It’s okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> reassuringly, and <PER>Harry</PER> led the way into the sitting room.
“Let me do that,” offered <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> took the matches from her.
her stood watching <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups.
And it came to <PER>Harry</PER> instantly where <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, arm in arm with the teenage <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and that must be where all the missing photographs were: in <PER>Rita</PER>’s book.
“Miss Bagshot?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated, and Bagshot?” <PER>Harry</PER> advanced with the picture in Bagshot?” <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what are you doing?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Why did you ask us to come with you, Mistress — Miss — Bagshot?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, raising <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own voice.
“Was there something you wanted to tell us?” Giving no sign that she had heard <PER>Hermione</PER>, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Oh, right <PER>Hermione</PER>, I think <PER>Hermione</PER> wants me to go upstairs with <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “All right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “let’s go.” But when <PER>Hermione</PER> moved, Bathilda shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head with surprising vigor, once more pointing first at <PER>Harry</PER>, then to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> wants me to go with <PER>Hermione</PER>, alone.” “Why?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise.
“Maybe <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to give the sword to me, and only to me?” “Do you really think she knows who you are?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, “I think she does.” “Well, okay then, but be quick, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Lead the way,” <PER>Harry</PER> told Bathilda.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced back at <PER>Hermione</PER> with a reassuring smile, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure <PER>Hermione</PER> had seen it; <PER>Hermione</PER> stood hugging <PER>Hermione</PER> in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase.
As <PER>Harry</PER> walked out of the room, unseen by both <PER>Hermione</PER> and Bathilda, <PER>Harry</PER> slipped the silver- P a g e ?
The stairs were steep and narrow: <PER>Harry</PER> was half tempted to place <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands on stout Bathilda’s backside to ensure that stout Bathilda’s did not topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too likely.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than <PER>Harry</PER>'s own heart: It was an unpleasant, agitating sensation.
“Have you got anything for me?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, but she seemed distracted by <PER>Harry</PER>'s lit wand-tip.
Then she closed shis eyes and several things happened at once: <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved momentarily.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: Hold <PER>Harry</PER>).
<PER>Harry</PER> swayed where <PER>Harry</PER> stood: The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around <PER>Harry</PER> again; <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what had just happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window.
<PER>Harry</PER> edged between shis and the unmade bed, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand raised.
“What is it?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked as <PER>Harry</PER> reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.
From below his heard <PER>Hermione</PER> call, “<PER>Harry</PER>?” his could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a heavy smooth mass smashed his to the floor and his felt it slide over his, powerful, muscular “No!” No!
He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: the snake struck, and <PER>Hermione</PER> dived aside with a shriek; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered.
Frozen air filled the room as <PER>Harry</PER> ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot slipped on a pencil-like something — his wand — <PER>Harry</PER> bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, the room tail thrashing; <PER>Hermione</PER> was nowhere to be seen and for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, but as <PER>Harry</PER> did so, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years.
Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as <PER>Harry</PER> jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape <PER>Harry</PER> knew to be <PER>Hermione</PER> — She shrieked with pain as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled Shis back across the bed: The snake reared again, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was going to split open with the pain from <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar — The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging <PER>Hermione</PER> with The snake; as it struck, <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed, “ ConfringoV’ and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; <PER>Harry</PER> felt the heat of it sear the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
Beneath the robe <PER>Harry</PER> fingered the handle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“Not <PER>Harry</PER>, not <PER>Harry</PER>, please not <PER>Harry</PER>!” “Stand aside, you silly girl stand aside, now.
<PER>Harry</PER>, not <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the thing that was rustling was not a snake.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“I couldn’t get the Horcrux off you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, and he knew <PER>Hermione</PER> wanted to change the subject.
“Where’s my wand, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> took it into <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> held out the wand to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> pointed it at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“ Expelliarmusl” <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave Expelliarmusl” <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s wand's hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what <PER>Harry</PER> was seeing the wand that had survived so much “<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered so quietly <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly hear <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“We’ll — We’ll find a way to repair it.” “<PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, the tears trickling down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet <PER>Harry</PER> could not appreciate it: <PER>Harry</PER> senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
Without realizing it, <PER>Harry</PER> was digging <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers into <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms as if <PER>Harry</PER> were trying to resist physical pain.
<PER>Harry</PER> had spilled <PER>Harry</PER>'s own blood more times than <PER>Harry</PER> could count; <PER>Harry</PER> had lost all the bones in <PER>Harry</PER>'s right arm once; this journey had already given <PER>Harry</PER> scars to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest and forearm to join those on <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of <PER>Harry</PER>'s magical power had been torn from <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew exactly what <PER>Hermione</PER> would say if <PER>Harry</PER> expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s hand brushed the old Snitch through the mokeskin and for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away.
Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left behind — And <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fury at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> broke over <PER>Dumbledore</PER> now like lava, scorching <PER>Dumbledore</PER> inside, wiping out every other feeling.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, them had no sword, and now, <PER>Harry</PER> had no wand.
And <PER>Harry</PER> had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely be easy now for <PER>Voldemort</PER> to find out who <PER>Voldemort</PER> was.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked frightened that <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Hermione</PER> face streaked with tears, <PER>Hermione</PER> crouched down beside <PER>Harry</PER>, two cups of tea trembling in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands and something bulky under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arm.
“You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>; he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes to the caption.
<PER>Harry</PER> soon discovered it and read greedily, but became lost: it was necessary to go further back to make sense of it all, and eventually <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> at the start of a chapter entitled “The Greater Good.” Together, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> started to read: Now approaching <PER>Harry</PER>'s eighteenth birthday, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory — Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal- Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias “Dogbreath” Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had picked up at school.
Certainly <PER>Dumbledore</PER> returned to Godric’s Hollow at once, supposedly to “care” for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s younger brother and sister.
How despicable does Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> appear, busy plotting Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s rise to power when Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> should have been mourning Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mother and caring for Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s sister!
No doubt those determined to keep Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s crumbling pedestal will bleat that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not, after all, put Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s plans into action, that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> must have suffered a change of heart, that Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> came to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s senses.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> come to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s senses?
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told Grindelwald <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted no more part in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s plans?
However, there can be no doubt that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s attack upon Gellert Grindelwald.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had reached the bottom of the page before <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> tugged the book out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hands, looking a little alarmed by <PER>Harry</PER>'s expression, and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something indecent.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, the phoenix wand “<PER>Harry</PER>.” She seemed to have heard his thoughts.
“I’m not trying to defend what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wrote,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so angry is that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told you any of this <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Maybe I am!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, and <PER>Harry</PER> flung <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, hardly knowing whether his was trying to hold in his anger or protect his from the weight of his own disillusionment.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had called out to <PER>Harry</PER> in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices.
Finally <PER>Harry</PER> got up in the darkness and joined <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, an impression reinforced by <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s solicitousness.
As darkness drew in again <PER>Harry</PER> refused <PER>Hermione</PER>’s offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters <PER>Harry</PER> owned but even so, still shivery.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that it must be full of living creatures, but <PER>Harry</PER> wished they would all remain still and silent so that <PER>Harry</PER> could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other, sinister movements.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and at once thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard it again before mentally shaking <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt that <PER>Harry</PER> had been waiting for her to come, but that <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged to meet.
<PER>Harry</PER> impulse to shout for <PER>Hermione</PER>, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone.
Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and <PER>Harry</PER> spun about, but all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked black surface glittering as <PER>Harry</PER> raised the wand higher to examine it.
What was it, <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> (walking again), that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> the last time <PER>Harry</PER> had retrieved the sword?
A small voice inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head answered <PER>Harry</PER>: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped walking and let out a long sigh, <PER>Harry</PER>'s smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Harry</PER> had to do.
If <PER>Harry</PER> was honest with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> had thought it might come to this from the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had spotted the sword through the ice.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack <PER>Harry</PER>.
They had had They's chance as <PER>Harry</PER> walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as <PER>Harry</PER> examined the pool.
With fumbling fingers <PER>Harry</PER> started to remove <PER>Harry</PER>'s many layers of clothing.
<PER>Harry</PER> put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and shaking, until <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> that it must be done, gathered all <PER>Harry</PER>'s courage, and dived.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked out wildly, trying to push <PER>Harry</PER> back to the surface, but merely propelled <PER>Harry</PER> into the rocky side of the pool.
Thrashing, suffocating, <PER>Harry</PER> scrabbled at the strangling chain, <PER>Harry</PER>'s frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and <PER>Harry</PER> was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing <PER>Harry</PER> could do, and the arms that closed around <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest were surely Death’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had come again, as <PER>Hermione</PER> had come when the snake attacked.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no strength to lift <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and see <PER>Harry</PER>'s savior’s identity.
Shivering violently, <PER>Harry</PER> staggered to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“Why the hell,” panted <PER>Ron</PER>, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, “didn’t you take this thing off before you dived?” <PER>Harry</PER> could not answer.
As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head, <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Ron</PER>, half expecting him to have disappeared every time him lost sight of him, and yet him had to be real: him had just dived into the pool, him had saved <PER>Harry</PER>’s life.
“It was y-you?” <PER>Harry</PER> said at last, <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth chattering, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice weaker than usual due to <PER>Harry</PER>'s near-strangulation.
“I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come up, so I wasn’t going to make a detour to — hey!” <PER>Harry</PER> was already hurrying to the place <PER>Ron</PER> had indicated.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked back to where <PER>Ron</PER> stood waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux.
It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill <PER>Harry</PER> rather than let <PER>Harry</PER> possess it.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around, holding <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree.
“Come here,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER> led the way, brushed snow from the rock’s surface, and held out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand for the Horcrux.
When <PER>Ron</PER> offered the sword, however, <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had at least taught <PER>Harry</PER> something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.
The answer came so readily to <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips that <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Harry</PER> had always known it deep down: Perhaps it had taken <PER>Harry</PER>'s recent encounter with Nagini to make <PER>Harry</PER> realize it.
“Let’s get rid of the damn thing, it’s been months — ” “I can’t, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m serious — you do it — ” “But why?” “Because that thing’s bad for me!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, backing away from the locket on the rock.
“On three,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking back down at the locket and narrowing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach.
<PER>Ron</PER> raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes, and <PER>Harry</PER> gripped the locket tightly, bracing <PER>Harry</PER>, already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows.
“ Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend Second best, always, eternally overshadowed ” “<PER>Ron</PER>, stab it now!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed: <PER>Harry</PER> could feel the locket quivering in <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip and was scared of what was coming.
<PER>Ron</PER> raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, <PER>Riddle</PER>’s eyes gleamed scarlet.
Out of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed, like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, weirdly distorted.
<PER>Ron</PER> yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, swaying over <PER>Ron</PER> and the real <PER>Harry</PER>, who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” he shouted, but the <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Harry</PER> was now speaking with <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s voice and <PER>Ron</PER> was gazing, mesmerized, into its face.
“ Your mother confessed,” sneered <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Harry</PER>, while <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Hermione</PER> jeered, “that <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Hermione</PER> would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange ” “Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him,” crooned <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Hermione</PER>, and what woman stretched like a snake and entwined what woman around <PER>Riddle</PER>-<PER>Harry</PER>, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s raised the sword high, <PER>Ron</PER>’s's arms shaking.
“Do it, <PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked toward him, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — ?” The sword flashed, plunged: <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> out of the way, there was a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream.
<PER>Harry</PER> whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend <PER>Harry</PER>: but there was nothing to fight.
The monstrous versions of himself and <PER>Hermione</PER> were gone: There was only <PER>Ron</PER>, standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock.
Slowly, <PER>Harry</PER> walked back to <PER>Harry</PER>, hardly knowing what to say or do.
<PER>Ron</PER> was breathing heavily: <PER>Harry</PER> eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue; their were also wet.
<PER>Harry</PER> stooped, pretending <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux.
<PER>Ron</PER> had pierced the glass in both windows: <PER>Riddle</PER>’s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> crammed the broken locket into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket, knelt down beside <PER>Ron</PER>, and placed a hand cautiously on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> took it as a good sign that <PER>Ron</PER> did not throw it off.
“After you left,” <PER>Harry</PER> said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that <PER>Ron</PER>’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet again and walked to where <PER>Ron</PER>’s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as <PER>Ron</PER> had run toward the pool to save <PER>Harry</PER> from drowning.
<PER>Harry</PER> hoisted it onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s own back and walked back to <PER>Ron</PER>, who clambered to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet as <PER>Harry</PER> approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.
“I’ve been trying to tell you that for years.” Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, <PER>Harry</PER> gripping the still-sopping back of <PER>Ron</PER>’s jacket.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not wait to wake <PER>Hermione</PER>, and it was with quickening excitement that <PER>Harry</PER> entered the tent, <PER>Ron</PER> lagging a little behind him.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was fast asleep, curled up under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s blankets, and did not move until <PER>Harry</PER> had said <PER>Hermione</PER>'s name several times.
<PER>Harry</PER> backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off <PER>Ron</PER>’s rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas.
<PER>Hermione</PER> slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward <PER>Ron</PER>, her eyes upon his pale face.
<PER>Hermione</PER> stopped right in front of him, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lips slightly parted, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes wide.
<PER>Hermione</PER> launched <PER>Hermione</PER> forward and started punching every inch of him that <PER>Hermione</PER> could reach.
“You — crawl — back — here — after — weeks — and — weeks — oh, where’s my wand?” She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hands and <PER>Harry</PER> reacted instinctively.
“Protegol” The invisible shield erupted between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>: The force of it knocked her backward onto the floor.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You come back after weeks — weeks — and you think it’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry?” “Well, what else can I say?” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted, and <PER>Harry</PER> was glad that <PER>Ron</PER> was fighting back.
“Rack your brains, <PER>Ron</PER>, that should only take a couple of seconds — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” interjected <PER>Harry</PER>, who considered this a low blow, “he just saved my — ” “I don’t care!” she screamed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were dead, you don’t know what it’s been like — ” “What it’s been like for you?” Her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but Her had reached a level of indignation that rendered Her's temporarily speechless, and <PER>Ron</PER> seized his opportunity.
“I wanted to come back the minute I’d Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I couldn’t go anywhere!” “A gang of what?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> threw herself down into a chair with herself's arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that herself would unravel them for several years.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered: It had been the first time <PER>Ron</PER>’s name had been said aloud by either of them since the day <PER>Harry</PER> had left; <PER>Hermione</PER> had mentioned it when talking about repairing <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand.
“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you know?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together automatically.
They explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded, <PER>Hermione</PER> frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard <PER>Hermione</PER> forgot to keep <PER>Hermione</PER>'s limbs locked together.
“Well, it — it screamed,” said <PER>Harry</PER> with half a glance at <PER>Ron</PER>.
Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, <PER>Harry</PER> removed the Shield Charm with a wave of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand and turned to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?” “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been watching <PER>Hermione</PER> examining the locket.
“Mine’s broken.” “You’re kidding?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, but at that moment <PER>Hermione</PER> got to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, and he looked apprehensive again.
<PER>Hermione</PER> put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bed and settled down without another word.
<PER>Ron</PER> passed <PER>Harry</PER> the new wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not expected <PER>Hermione</PER>’s anger to abate overnight, and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning.
During those few moments <PER>Harry</PER> spent alone with <PER>Harry</PER>, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), <PER>Ron</PER> became shamelessly cheery.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of Gryffindor’s sword, and above all, <PER>Ron</PER>’s return, made <PER>Harry</PER> so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face.
Late in the afternoon he and <PER>Ron</PER> escaped <PER>Hermione</PER>’s baleful presence again, and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news.
<PER>Harry</PER> had finally managed to tell <PER>Ron</PER> the whole story of <PER>Harry</PER>'s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric’s Hollow; <PER>Ron</PER> was now filling <PER>Harry</PER> in on everything <PER>Harry</PER> had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during <PER>Harry</PER>'s weeks away. "
“But I haven’t got a problem calling him V — ” “NO!” roared <PER>Ron</PER>, causing <PER>Harry</PER> to jump into the hedge and <PER>Hermione</PER> (nose buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them.
“Sorry,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, wrenching <PER>Harry</PER> back out of the brambles, “but the name’s been jinxed, <PER>Harry</PER>, that’s how they track people!
“<PER>Harry</PER> you don’t reckon it could’ve been <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> what?” <PER>Ron</PER> looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> the doe?
“Tonks’s changed, didn’t it?” “Yeah, but if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was alive, why wouldn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> show <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
Partly to change the subject, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Speaking of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “Oh yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER> at once, “people are talking about it quite a lot.
<PER>Harry</PER> took aim at it with the wand <PER>Ron</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> the previous night, which <PER>Hermione</PER> had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of blackthorn.
“I’m sorry I said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was young, okay?” <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten <PER>Ron</PER>’s hatred of spiders.
Every minor spell <PER>Harry</PER> had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those <PER>Harry</PER> had produced with <PER>Harry</PER>'s phoenix wand.
“You just need to practice,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to enlarge and reduce the spider.
Keen for them all to be friends again, however, He agreed; but when <PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Hermione</PER> a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind shis book once more.
Sitting in the entrance, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet; but <PER>Harry</PER>'s magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was lying on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bunk reading, while <PER>Ron</PER>, after many nervous glances up at <PER>Hermione</PER>, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it.
For ten minutes or so <PER>Ron</PER> tapped and muttered, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned the pages of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s book, and <PER>Harry</PER> continued to practice with the blackthorn wand.
Finally <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed down from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bunk.
<PER>Hermione</PER> did not deign to respond, but approached <PER>Harry</PER>.
It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on his in there; his was not sure his felt up to hearing <PER>Rita</PER>’s version of his relationship with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He hated seeing absolute proof that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> really had written those words, that they had not been <PER>Rita</PER>’s invention.
“Er — what are you — ?” said <PER>Ron</PER> tentatively, but <PER>Hermione</PER> quelled him with a look and turned back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We keep trying to convince We <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left us secret signs and clues — ” “The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” piped up <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I think <PER>Hermione</PER>’s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.” <PER>Harry</PER> threw him a dark look.
<PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure that <PER>Ron</PER>’s support of <PER>Hermione</PER> had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune.
“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” <PER>Ron</PER> added, “Lovegood’s on your side, <PER>Harry</PER>, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone everyone’ve got to help you!” “I’m sure this is important!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> earnestly.
“But don’t you think if it was, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have told me about it was before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died?” “Maybe maybe it’s something you need to find out for yourself,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a faint air of clutching at straws.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sycophantically, “that makes sense.” “No, it doesn’t,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but I still think we ought to talk to Mister Lovegood.
“Outvoted, <PER>Harry</PER>, sorry,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, clapping him on the back.
They walked for a few hours, <PER>Harry</PER>, at <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak.
When <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> caught up with <PER>Harry</PER>, panting and clutching stitches in <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s sides, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> grinning broadly.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth.
“You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” Xenophilius did not take <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, although the eye that was not pointing inward at <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose slid straight to the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“Why have you come here?” Before <PER>Harry</PER> could speak, however, <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a small cry of shock.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, embarrassed, “now’s not the moment — ” “But <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s an Erumpent horn!
<PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that <PER>Harry</PER> was undergoing some painful internal struggle.
“Well, I agree with <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said, shoving the tray into <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms and joining <PER>Harry</PER> at the statue’s side.
“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” <PER>Harry</PER> turned to look at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I assume that you are all familiar with “The Tale of the Three Brothers’?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “No,” but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both said, “Yes.” Xenophilius nodded gravely.
“Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,” said <PER>Harry</PER> before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, of course.” “But,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Hermione</PER>'s restraint starting to crack, “Mister Lovegood, how can you possibly believe — ?” “Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius.
She, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> glanced at one another, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew that they were all thinking the same thing.
“I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.” “So the Elder Wand,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, before <PER>Hermione</PER> could retort, “you think that exists too?” “Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said Xenophilius.
Finally <PER>Hermione</PER> asked stiffly, “Mister Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?” Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in <PER>Harry</PER>’s memory, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not locate it.
“It’s just a morality tale, It’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d choose — ” The three of them spoke at the same time; <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “the Cloak,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, “the wand,” and <PER>Harry</PER> said, “the stone.” They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused.
“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but you wouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grinned at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> was, after all, ridiculous.
<PER>Harry</PER> wand, <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night <PER>Voldemort</PER> had pursued <PER>Voldemort</PER> across the skies.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings.
Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces: <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>.
What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that the chains were actually one word, repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends friends friends <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great rush of affection for Luna.
“What’s wrong?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked as <PER>Harry</PER> descended the staircase, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> drew their wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his pocket.
<PER>Hermione</PER> stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand still pointing at Mister Lovegood.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, look at this.” <PER>Harry</PER> strode over to her as quickly as <PER>Harry</PER> could through all the clutter.
“The Quibbler’s going for a new angle, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked coldly, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind working very fast.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized their mistake just in time: <PER>Harry</PER> launched <PER>Harry</PER> sideways, shoving <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> out of harm’s way as Xenophilius’s Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn.
<PER>Harry</PER> flew through the air, then crashed to the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
He heard <PER>Hermione</PER>’s scream, <PER>Ron</PER>’s yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off him's feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs.
Half buried in rubble, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to raise <PER>Harry</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> could barely breathe or see for dust.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> gasp, and <PER>Harry</PER> had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over <PER>Harry</PER>, immersing <PER>Harry</PER>'s body in its shadow.
“Come on,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.” <PER>Harry</PER> started to dig <PER>Harry</PER> out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase.
<PER>Ron</PER> was buried deepest: <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs.
While Xenophilius ’s banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, <PER>Hermione</PER> managed to free <PER>Ron</PER> with the use of a Hover Charm.
“Do you trust me, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what <PER>Hermione</PER> was waiting for.
They fell like boulders, <PER>Harry</PER> still holding onto Shis hand for dear life; there was a scream from below, and <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling.
<PER>Hermione</PER> twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears as she dragged <PER>Harry</PER> once more into darkness.
“Protego Totalum Salvio Hexia ” “That treacherous old bleeder!” <PER>Ron</PER> panted, emerging from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing the Invisibility Cloak to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of <PER>Harry</PER> before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!” “Why hide me, though?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Yeah, you are, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” agreed <PER>Harry</PER> fervently.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> must be alive, <PER>Hermione</PER> must!” “Then <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it?” “But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, <PER>Ron</PER>!” “You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s Invisibility Cloak — ” “ The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> firmly.
“No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!” “When my wand connected with <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s, it made my mum and dad appear and Cedric ” “But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Then, as she glanced at <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that it was fear: <PER>Harry</PER> had scared her with <PER>Harry</PER>'s talk of living with dead people.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story — ” “Fit everything in?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated.
“What did <PER>Dumbledore</PER> do with it after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> broke it open?” But <PER>Harry</PER>’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” But he scarcely heard <PER>Hermione</PER>: he had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air.
The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it And then, with a gasp, he remembered — “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had my Cloak the night my parents died!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> voice shook and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could feel the color in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not care.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> again, but <PER>Harry</PER> was busy undoing the pouch around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck, his fingers shaking hard.
<PER>Harry</PER> Cloak was the third Hallow, and when <PER>Harry</PER> discovered how to open the Snitch <PER>Harry</PER> would have the second, and then all <PER>Harry</PER> needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then — But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and his stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken.
“That’s what he’s after.” The change in his voice made <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> look even more scared.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s after the Elder Wand.” <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s after the Elder Wandthe Elder Wand.” turned <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s after the Elder Wand.”'s back on their strained, incredulous faces.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was not seeking a new wand; <PER>Voldemort</PER> was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> looked out into the night, thinking.
Nobody could have told <PER>Voldemort</PER> The Tales of Beedle the Bard when <PER>Voldemort</PER> was a child, any more than <PER>Harry</PER> had heard them.
If <PER>Voldemort</PER> had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely <PER>Voldemort</PER> would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death?
<PER>Harry</PER> felt lightheaded with amazement at <PER>Harry</PER>'s discoveries.
It was a shock to see <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> standing exactly where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had left them, <PER>Hermione</PER> still holding Lily’s letter, <PER>Ron</PER> at her side looking slightly anxious.
“This is it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, trying to bring them inside the glow of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own astonished certainty.
“ — and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s chasing the third, but <PER>Voldemort</PER> doesn’t realize <PER>Voldemort</PER> just thinks it’s a powerful wand “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, moving across to <PER>Voldemort</PER> and handing <PER>Voldemort</PER> back Lily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.” “But don’t you see?
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was turning the Snitch over and over in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to <PER>Hermione</PER> that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real.
The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and him could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if <PER>Harry</PER> could just possess them all.
If only he had the stone, only he had the stone could ask <PER>Dumbledore</PER> these questions in person and <PER>Harry</PER> murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar would burn and show <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, because for the first time ever, <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> were united in wanting the very same thing .
It was as though a flame had been lit inside <PER>Harry</PER> that nothing, not <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s flat disbelief nor <PER>Ron</PER>’s persistent doubts, could extinguish.
He blamed <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed <PER>Harry</PER>’s so much that <PER>Harry</PER> felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes.
“Obsession?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low fierce voice, when <PER>Harry</PER> was careless enough to use the word one evening, after <PER>Hermione</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> off for <PER>Harry</PER>'s lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left the sign of the Hallows for <PER>Hermione</PER> to decipher, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had also, <PER>Harry</PER> remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch.
master of Death Why didn’t <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> understand?
“I thought it was <PER>Voldemort</PER> we were supposed to be fighting?” <PER>Hermione</PER> retorted, and <PER>Harry</PER> gave up on <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The only other thing that mattered to <PER>Harry</PER> was that <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar had begun to prickle again, although <PER>Harry</PER> did all <PER>Harry</PER> could to hide this fact from the other two.
<PER>Harry</PER> was worried that the connection between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever He had told <PER>Hermione</PER>, prized.
Somehow <PER>Harry</PER> connected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind as well as before.
As the weeks crept on, <PER>Harry</PER> could not help but notice, even through <PER>Harry</PER>'s new self-absorption, that <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to be taking charge.
Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because <PER>Harry</PER>’s descent into listlessness galvanized <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormant leadership qualities, <PER>Ron</PER> was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action.
He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but <PER>Ron</PER> insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, <PER>Harry</PER> was aware, to keep them moving.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when <PER>Ron</PER> shouted excitedly from inside the tent.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> gazed at one another in horror.
Half of <PER>Harry</PER> yearned to hear more, half of <PER>Harry</PER> was afraid of what might come next.
“And what would you say to <PER>Harry</PER> if you knew <PER>Harry</PER> was listening, Romulus?” “I’d tell <PER>Harry</PER> we’re all with <PER>Harry</PER> in spirit,” said Lupin, then hesitated slightly.
“And I’d tell <PER>Harry</PER> to follow <PER>Harry</PER>'s instincts, which are good and nearly always right.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, whose eyes were full of tears.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>” — all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’ party in his house.
“May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of <PER>Harry</PER>’s supporters against following <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s lead.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were still beaming.
Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; <PER>Harry</PER> had become so used to friendly voices's isolation <PER>Harry</PER> had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Like us.” “But did you hear what Fred said?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> excitedly; now the broadcast was over, <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts turned again toward <PER>Harry</PER>'s all-consuming obsession.
“I told you, <PER>Harry</PER>, I told you, we can’t say it anymore — we’ve got to put the protection back around we — quickly — it’s how they find — ” But <PER>Ron</PER> stopped talking, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew why.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop them, someone had rummaged through <PER>Harry</PER>'s pockets and removed the blackthorn wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched at <PER>Harry</PER>'s excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though <PER>Harry</PER> had suffered some violent allergic reaction.
<PER>Harry</PER> eyes had been reduced to slits through which <PER>Harry</PER> could barely see; <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses fell off as <PER>Harry</PER> was bundled out of the tent; all <PER>Harry</PER> could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> outside too.
There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: <PER>Ron</PER> grunted in pain and <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed, “No!
A thud told <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Ron</PER> had been cast down beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Greyback’s gloating voice from overhead, and <PER>Harry</PER> was rolled over onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
“I said,” repeated Greyback, and <PER>Harry</PER> received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain, “what happened to you?” “Stung,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
“<PER>Dudley</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’b Bardy,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that his mouth was full of blood.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still half blind, barely able to see anything through <PER>Harry</PER>'s puffed-up eyes.
“Anyone still got a wand?” “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> from either side of him.
“I think there is a <PER>Dudley</PER> in there.” <PER>Harry</PER> could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this?
So close So close With a huge effort of will <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind to <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, pulling <PER>Voldemort</PER> back to where <PER>Voldemort</PER> sat, tied to <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Dean, and Griphook in the darkness, listening to Greyback and Scabior.
“ ‘’ermione Granger,’ ” Scabior was saying, “ ‘the Mudblood who is known to be traveling with ’arry Potter.’ ” <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep he present, not to slip into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s scar was exquisitely painful, but <PER>Harry</PER> struggled with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s strength against the pull of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts: It had never been so important to remain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own right mind.
Nobody spoke: <PER>Harry</PER> sensed the gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s arm trembling against <PER>Harry</PER>.
Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where <PER>Harry</PER> sat, crouching down again to stare closely at <PER>Harry</PER>'s misshapen features.
“What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” he asked softly, his breath foul in <PER>Harry</PER>’s nostrils as <PER>Harry</PER> pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar.
“Don’t touch it!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled; <PER>Harry</PER> could not stop <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> might be sick from the pain of it.
“There was glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait — ” And seconds later <PER>Harry</PER>’s glasses had been rammed back onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER>, still fighting to remain present inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s own splitting head, could think of nothing to say: Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind — — He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress — No, He was <PER>Harry</PER>, tied up and wandless, in grave danger — — looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower — He was <PER>Harry</PER>, and they were discussing He's fate in low voices — — Time to fly “to the Ministry?” “To hell with the Ministry,” growled Greyback.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s scar seared again — — and <PER>Harry</PER> rose into the night, flying straight up to the window at the very top of the tower — " completely sure it’s him?
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Hermione</PER>’s breathing, fast and terrified.
<PER>Harry</PER> struggled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand, but it was hopeless: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were squeezed tightly against <PER>Harry</PER> on either side, <PER>Harry</PER> could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar seared more painfully still — — as <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor, inside the cell-like room — The prisoners lurched into one another as The prisoners landed in a country lane.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then <PER>Harry</PER> saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, for <PER>Harry</PER> was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower.
How long it would take <PER>Voldemort</PER> to get to this place, once <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was here, was another matter.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw a ghostly white shape above <PER>Harry</PER>, and realized it was an albino peacock.
<PER>Harry</PER> stumbled and was dragged onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet by Greyback; now <PER>Harry</PER> was staggering along sideways, tied back-to- back to the four other prisoners.
Closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s puffy eyes, <PER>Harry</PER> allowed the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar to overcome <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, wanting to know what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was doing, whether <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew yet that <PER>Harry</PER> was caught.
“What is this?” The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> fell on <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears.
He was panicking now: He could see no way out, and it was easier, as He's fear mounted, to block out <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts, though <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar was still burning.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, come here.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare look directly at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but saw <PER>Harry</PER> obliquely: a figure slightly taller than <PER>Harry</PER> was, rising from an armchair, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.
Through the slits of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s own reflection for the first time since leaving Grimmauld Place.
“Well, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
He was keeping He's distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> was of looking at him.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, everything will be forgiv — ” “Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said Greyback menacingly.
Lucius approached <PER>Harry</PER> himself, came so close that <PER>Harry</PER> could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through <PER>Harry</PER>'s swollen eyes.
With his face a puffy mask, <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> was peering out from between the bars of a cage.
<PER>Harry</PER> was nearly thrown off <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light fell on <PER>Hermione</PER> instead.
“It’s them, Potter’s friends — <PER>Malfoy</PER>, look at him, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s ’s son's name — ?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> again, his back to the prisoners.
“I’d say I’ll get a bite or two, wouldn’t you, ginger?” <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Ron</PER> shaking.
“HERMIONE!” <PER>Ron</PER> bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together, so that <PER>Harry</PER> staggered.
“Shut up, <PER>Ron</PER>, we need to work out a way — ” “We need a plan, stop yelling — we need to get these ropes off — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>?” came a whisper through the darkness.
Craning around, <PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of their fellow prisoners: Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound <PER>Harry</PER> to the humans.
<PER>Harry</PER> tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs <PER>Hermione</PER> was screaming worse than ever, and next to him <PER>Ron</PER> was bellowing, “How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix scream.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>, fetch the goblin, “<PER>Malfoy</PER> can tell us whether the sword is real or not!” <PER>Harry</PER> dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor.
“Griphook,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered into the goblin’s pointed ear, “you must tell them that sword’s a fake, them mustn’t know it’s the real one, Griphook, please — ” <PER>Harry</PER> could hear someone scuttling down the cellar steps; next moment, <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s shaking voice spoke from behind the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> hit <PER>Ron</PER> on the arm to stop him shouting, and <PER>Ron</PER> looked terrified at his mistake.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, “Dobby has come to rescue you.” “But how did you — ?” An awful scream drowned <PER>Harry</PER>’s words: <PER>Hermione</PER> was being tortured again.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> launched themselves upon him.
<PER>Ron</PER> seized Wormtail’s wand arm and forced Wormtail’s wand arm upward; <PER>Harry</PER> slapped a hand to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, muffling his voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not expected it: <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched <PER>Harry</PER> free, astonished, keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand over Wormtail’s mouth.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw the ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: <PER>Harry</PER> seemed just as shocked as <PER>Harry</PER> at what <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and <PER>Harry</PER> continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness.
The silver tool that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER>'s most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping Pettigrew's reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; his was being strangled before their eyes.
“No!” <PER>Ron</PER> had released Wormtail too, and together he and <PER>Harry</PER> tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail’s throat, but it was no use.
“Relashiol” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a dreadful scream from overhead.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail’s body on the floor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room.
“Is it the true sword?” <PER>Harry</PER> waited, holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath, fighting against the prickling of <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar.
His true surroundings vanished: His was <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and the skeletal wizard before <PER>Voldemort</PER> was laughing toothlessly at <PER>Voldemort</PER>; <PER>Voldemort</PER> was enraged at the summons <PER>Voldemort</PER> felt — <PER>Voldemort</PER> had warned them, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had told them to summon <PER>Voldemort</PER> for nothing less than Potter.
Jets of light flew from <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s, Narcissa’s, and Greyback’s wands; <PER>Harry</PER> threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them.
Bellatrix was supporting <PER>Hermione</PER>, who seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s throat.
“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into <PER>Hermione</PER>’s throat: <PER>Harry</PER> saw beads of blood appear there.
“All right!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, and <PER>Harry</PER> dropped Bellatrix’s wand onto the floor at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions: <PER>Malfoy</PER> doubled over, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hands covering <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s bloody face.
As <PER>Ron</PER> ran to pull <PER>Hermione</PER> out of the wreckage, <PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s chance: <PER>Harry</PER> leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefyl” The werewolf was lifted off The werewolf's feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground.
“Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save <PER>Harry</PER> Potter and Dobby's friends!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar was blinding <PER>Harry</PER> with pain.
Dimly <PER>Harry</PER> knew that they had moments, seconds before <PER>Voldemort</PER> was with them.
As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and <PER>Malfoy</PER>, of the streak of red that was <PER>Ron</PER>’s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix’s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing — Bill and Fleur’s Shell Cottage Bill and Fleur’s Fleur had disappeared into the unknown; all Fleur could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to take Fleur there.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, relinquished Dobby’s hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground.
There seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw movement outside it.
“Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, clutching the two wands <PER>Harry</PER> had brought from the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’, ready to fight if <PER>Harry</PER> needed to.
“HELP!” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all <PER>Harry</PER> cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that <PER>Harry</PER> had stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s thin arms to <PER>Harry</PER> with a look of supplication.
It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant <PER>Harry</PER> knelt again beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix’s silver knife.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf’s body, then dragged off <PER>Harry</PER>'s own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket.
The sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; <PER>Harry</PER> listened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which <PER>Harry</PER> could take no interest, making decisions.
<PER>Harry</PER> agreed without really knowing what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying.
As <PER>Harry</PER> did so, <PER>Harry</PER> gazed down at the tiny body, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar prickled and burned, and in one part of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> punishing those they had left behind at <PER>Malfoy</PER> Manor.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> rage was dreadful and yet <PER>Harry</PER>’s grief for Dobby seemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached <PER>Harry</PER> from across a vast, silent ocean.
He had learned control at last, learned to shut He's mind to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, the very thing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had wanted He to learn from <PER>Snape</PER>.
Just as <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not been able to possess <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER> was consumed with grief for Sirius, so <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts could not penetrate <PER>Harry</PER> now, while <PER>Harry</PER> mourned Dobby.
Grief, it seemed, drove <PER>Voldemort</PER> out though <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, of course, would have said that it was love.
On <PER>Harry</PER> dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming <PER>Harry</PER>'s grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar.
Deeper and deeper <PER>Harry</PER> sank into the grave, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew where <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been tonight, and whom <PER>Voldemort</PER> had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when <PER>Harry</PER> was rejoined by <PER>Ron</PER> and Dean.
“How’s <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Better,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Fleur’s looking after Fleur.” <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s retort ready for when they asked <PER>Harry</PER> why <PER>Harry</PER> had not simply created a perfect grave with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not need it.
<PER>Harry</PER> wrapped the elf more snugly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet; <PER>Ron</PER> put an arm around her when <PER>Hermione</PER> reached him.
“Now he could be sleeping.” <PER>Harry</PER> placed the elf into the grave, arranged <PER>Harry</PER>'s tiny limbs so that <PER>Harry</PER> might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body.
<PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> not to break down as <PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb.
When <PER>Harry</PER> stood up again, the stone read: <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar still prickling a little, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind full of those things that had come to <PER>Harry</PER> in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so <PER>Harry</PER> stood in the doorway, listening. "
If <PER>Ginny</PER>’d been at Hogwarts, they could have taken <PER>Ginny</PER>'s before we reached <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“I’m going to wash,” <PER>Harry</PER> told Bill, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, still covered in mud and Dobby’s blood.
Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent Dobby to the cellar, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen.
Help will always be given at Hog warts to those who ask for it <PER>Harry</PER> dried <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room.
<PER>Harry</PER> instinct was telling <PER>Harry</PER> one thing, <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain quite another.
The <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head smiled, surveying <PER>Harry</PER> over the tips of <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers, pressed together as if in prayer.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s clean hands and was momentarily surprised to see the cloth <PER>Harry</PER> was holding in them.
<PER>Harry</PER> set it down and returned to the hall, and as <PER>Harry</PER> did so, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar pulse angrily, and there flashed across <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building <PER>Harry</PER> knew extremely well.
“You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half- conscious goblin, <PER>Hermione</PER> looks as though <PER>Hermione</PER>’s been tortured, and <PER>Ron</PER>’s just refused to tell me anything — ” “We can’t tell you what We’re doing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> flatly.
“I need you two as well!” he called to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room.
“How are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“You were amazing — coming up with that story when <PER>Hermione</PER> was hurting you like that — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a weak smile as <PER>Ron</PER> gave her a one- armed squeeze.
“What are we doing now, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> moved to the window, turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on the spectacular view, and waited, <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms folded, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar prickling.
<PER>Hermione</PER> took the chair beside the dressing table; <PER>Ron</PER> sat on the arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> noted the goblin’s sallow skin, <PER>Harry</PER>'s long thin fingers, <PER>Harry</PER>'s black eyes.
While <PER>Harry</PER> tried to decide on the best way to approach <PER>Harry</PER>'s request, the goblin broke the silence.
Griphook looked at <PER>Harry</PER> out of the corners of <PER>Harry</PER>'s slanting black eyes.
“You are an unusual wizard, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” “In what way?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar absently.
<PER>Harry</PER> rather thought <PER>Harry</PER> was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to <PER>Harry</PER> whether Griphook approved of Dobby’s grave or not.
<PER>Harry</PER> gathered <PER>Harry</PER> for the attack.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very odd wizard.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.” The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen anything like <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I need to break into a Gringotts vault.” <PER>Harry</PER> had not meant to say it so baldly; the words were forced from <PER>Harry</PER> as pain shot through <PER>Harry</PER>'s lightning scar and <PER>Harry</PER> saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind firmly.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though he had gone mad.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — ” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was cut off by Griphook.
“It belongs to the Lestranges.” <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer.
“Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years?” (<PER>Ron</PER> fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s chair.)
“You can’t want You- Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!” The goblin gazed at <PER>Hermione</PER> with the same curiosity he had shown <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But — ” <PER>Ron</PER> started angrily; <PER>Hermione</PER> nudged him in the ribs.
Griphook did not protest, but <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him.
“He’s enjoying keeping us hanging.” “<PER>Harry</PER>,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the still-dark landing, “are you saying what I think you’re saying?
<PER>Harry</PER> was emaciated, the bones of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down on the empty bed, beside <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He knew, He was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to beat <PER>Voldemort</PER> to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s goal, or else to attempt to thwart him.
<PER>Harry</PER> took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck.
Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished, and did not look away until <PER>Harry</PER> had taken from <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket the two wands he had brought from the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’.
“I took this wand from <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> by force,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And <PER>Voldemort</PER> is interested in it, isn’t <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I — how?” croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> for help.
“he wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“He can’t know that, <PER>Harry</PER>, how could He — ?” “Priori Incantatem,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s’, <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a reproachful look, and said, “Let’s not worry about that now — ” But Mister Ollivander intervened.
“But how — how do you — ?” “Never mind how I know it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes momentarily as <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar burned and <PER>Harry</PER> saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther north.
They all looked up at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> appeared in the doorway, but <PER>Harry</PER> merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> behind him.
The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and <PER>Harry</PER> walked back to it, as the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head built more and more powerfully.
him must make only one more short effort, so that him could explain to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let’s go and get it before <PER>Harry</PER> does!” “It’s too late for that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help <PER>Harry</PER>, but clutched <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, trying to help it resist.
“Leave me now.” <PER>Snape</PER> bowed and set off back up the path, <PER>Snape</PER>'s black cloak billowing behind <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly, waiting for <PER>Snape</PER> ’s figure to disappear.
It would not do for <PER>Snape</PER>, or indeed anyone else, to see where <PER>Harry</PER> was going.
But there were no lights in the castle windows, and <PER>Harry</PER> could conceal <PER>Harry</PER> and in a second <PER>Harry</PER> had cast upon <PER>Harry</PER> a Disillusionment Charm that hid <PER>Harry</PER> even from <PER>Harry</PER>'s own eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s hands were folded upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s chest, and there <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s hands lay, clutched beneath them, buried with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Had he thought that <PER>Voldemort</PER> would be scared to violate <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s tomb?
Wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, Wherever <PER>Harry</PER> could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature.
Wherever <PER>Harry</PER> spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on Wherever <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
The enormity of his decision not to race <PER>Voldemort</PER> to the wand still scared <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was full of doubts, doubts that <PER>Ron</PER> could not help voicing whenever they were together.
“What if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?” “What if working out what the symbol meant made you ‘worthy’ to get the Hallows?” <PER>Harry</PER>, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know- P a g e ?
<PER>Harry</PER> could not even explain satisfactorily why <PER>Harry</PER> had decided against it: Every time <PER>Harry</PER> tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to <PER>Harry</PER>'s decision, they sounded feebler to <PER>Harry</PER>.
The odd thing was that <PER>Hermione</PER>’s support made him feel just as confused as <PER>Ron</PER>’s doubts.
“You couldn’t have broken into <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s grave.” But the idea of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s corpse frightened <PER>Harry</PER> much less than the possibility that <PER>Harry</PER> might have misunderstood the living <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s intentions.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt that <PER>Harry</PER> was still groping in the dark; <PER>Harry</PER> had chosen <PER>Harry</PER>'s path but kept looking back, wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> had misread the signs, whether <PER>Harry</PER> should not have taken the other way.
From time to time, anger at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> crashed over <PER>Dumbledore</PER> again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not explained before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> died.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had found <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument.
“Yes, he is, <PER>Ron</PER>, please don’t start that again!” “Look at the facts, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, speaking across <PER>Harry</PER>, who continued to gaze at the horizon.
“There you go!” said <PER>Ron</PER> quickly, before <PER>Hermione</PER> could carry on.
“If it wasn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “I can’t — but can you explain how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sent <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to we if <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?” “I dunno, it could’ve been his ghost!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
There was little about <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sure of now, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew that much.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have gone on.” “What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could say any more, a voice behind them said, “ ’Arry?” Fleur had come out of the cottage, Fleur's long silver hair flying in the breeze.
“Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you — ” “That’s great!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, relief surging through <PER>Harry</PER>.
Behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> said, “<PER>Harry</PER>’s having a laugh.
“Okay,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> turned back to face him, “how’s this?
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well tell <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> can have the sword after <PER>Harry</PER>’s helped us get into that vault — but us’ll be careful to avoid telling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> exactly when <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> can have it.” A grin spread slowly across <PER>Ron</PER>’s face.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, we can’t — ” “<PER>Harry</PER> can have it,” <PER>Harry</PER> went on, “after we’ve used it on all of the Horcruxes.
<PER>Hermione</PER> frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at <PER>Hermione</PER>, afraid that <PER>Hermione</PER> might give the game away.
“I have your word, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> only emerged for mealtimes.
The longer they spent together, the more <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER> did not much like the goblin.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Harry</PER>'s distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it: they needed Griphook.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt responsible: It was, after all, <PER>Harry</PER> who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that <PER>Harry</PER> could question <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER>'s fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Arthur could no longer work.
“Don’t worry about us.” And when she tried to protest he went on, “We’ll be off your hands soon too, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I.
“Luna, we told you,” <PER>Hermione</PER> called over to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Well, more of a crown, really.” <PER>Ron</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and grinned; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius.
Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to Fleur's feet, Fleur's wand pointing at the door; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> did the same.
All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: <PER>Hermione</PER> and Fleur both squealed, “Congratulations!” and <PER>Ron</PER> said, “Blimey, a baby!” as if he had never heard of such a thing before.
“M-me?” stammered <PER>Harry</PER> “You, yes, of course — Dora quite agrees, no one better — ” “I — yeah — blimey — ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was the only one who had noticed this, until <PER>Harry</PER> saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up the stairs.
“Godfather, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said Bill as “Godfather, <PER>Harry</PER>!” walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the table.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re planning something with Griphook.” It was a statement, not a question, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not bother to deny It.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised <PER>Harry</PER> in return?” “I can’t tell you that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Their plans were made, Their's preparations complete; in the smallest bedroom a single long, coarse black hair (plucked from the sweater <PER>Hermione</PER> had been wearing at <PER>Malfoy</PER> Manor) lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece.
“And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, nodding toward the walnut wand, “so I reckon you’ll be pretty convincing.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked frightened that the wand might sting or bite <PER>Hermione</PER>'s as <PER>Hermione</PER> picked it up.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been surprised, but pleased, to discover that it worked for <PER>Harry</PER> at least as well as <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s had done.
Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s problem was: <PER>Hermione</PER> had not won the walnut wand’s allegiance by taking it personally from Bellatrix.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to <PER>Harry</PER>, but regretted <PER>Harry</PER>'s action at once: <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that the goblin had noticed.
It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, <PER>Harry</PER> was impressed to learn, <PER>Hermione</PER> had protected from the Snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s sock.
It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> alone together for more than five minutes at a time: “He could give my mother lessons,” growled <PER>Ron</PER>, as the goblin’s long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors.
<PER>Hermione</PER> disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that <PER>Harry</PER> had given up attempting to pick <PER>Hermione</PER>'s brains on how best to do it; <PER>Ron</PER>, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than “Well just have to wing it, mate.” <PER>Harry</PER> slept badly that night.
Lying awake in the early hours, <PER>Harry</PER> thought back to the way <PER>Harry</PER> had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, almost an excitement.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> was experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts: <PER>Harry</PER> could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept telling <PER>Harry</PER> that their plan was good, that Griphook knew what their were facing, that their were well-prepared for all the difficulties their were likely to encounter, yet still <PER>Harry</PER> felt uneasy.
Once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> stir and was sure that <PER>Harry</PER> too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so <PER>Harry</PER> did not speak.
He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but <PER>Harry</PER> ached with sadness to think of leaving <PER>Harry</PER> behind.
<PER>Harry</PER> fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck, through which <PER>Harry</PER> could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which <PER>Harry</PER> had been sure <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eye.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well that it was really <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> could not suppress a shiver of loathing.
She was taller than <PER>Harry</PER> was, Shis long black hair rippling down Shis back, Shis heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then She spoke, and him heard <PER>Hermione</PER> through Bellatrix’s low voice.
“There,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “how does he look, <PER>Harry</PER>?” It was just possible to discern <PER>Ron</PER> under his disguise, but only, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, because <PER>Harry</PER> knew him so well.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s hair was now long and wavy; <PER>Ron</PER>’s had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.
“I should climb up now, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, I think?” <PER>Harry</PER> bent down and the goblin clambered onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands linked in front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not heavy, but <PER>Harry</PER> disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which <PER>Harry</PER> clung on.
The goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet found pavement and <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes on Charing Cross Road.
“Good morning,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and as <PER>Harry</PER> crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.
“Too polite,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s ear as they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard.
The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place <PER>Harry</PER> had visited before <PER>Harry</PER>'s first term at Hogwarts so many years before.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s own face glared down at <PER>Harry</PER> from posters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across <PER>Hermione</PER>'s path.
“Why, Madam Lestrange!” <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around and Griphook tightened <PER>Harry</PER>'s hold around <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck: A tall, thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them.
“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear, but at that moment <PER>Harry</PER> could not think who Travers was.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had drawn <PER>Hermione</PER> up to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fullest height and said with as much contempt as <PER>Hermione</PER> could muster: “And what do you want?” Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.
“ He’s another Death Eater\” breathed Griphook, and <PER>Harry</PER> sidled sideways to repeat the information into <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s ear.
“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly, “but if my presence is not welcome ” <PER>Harry</PER> recognized <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice now; Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house.
“No, no, not at all, Travers,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, trying to cover up <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mistake.
“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the inhabitants of <PER>Malfoy</PER> Manor were confined to the house, after the ah escape.” <PER>Harry</PER> willed <PER>Hermione</PER> to keep <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
<PER>Ron</PER> sloped along beside them, and <PER>Harry</PER> and Griphook followed.
A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side, there was no means for <PER>Harry</PER> to communicate with <PER>Hermione</PER> or <PER>Ron</PER>.
Knowing that he had only seconds; <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, “Confundo” twice.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s long black hair rippled behind <PER>Hermione</PER>'s as <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed the steps.
He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at He's companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, “Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.” <PER>Hermione</PER> swept forward, <PER>Ron</PER> by her side, <PER>Harry</PER> and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to <PER>Harry</PER>: standing on this very spot on the day that <PER>Harry</PER> had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> standing beside <PER>Harry</PER> saying, “ Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed, and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass.
<PER>Hermione</PER> allowed Travers to step ahead of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear, “the Imperius Cursel” <PER>Harry</PER> raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed the hawthorn wand at the old goblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life, “Imperiol” A curious sensation shot down <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm, a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, down the sinews and veins connecting <PER>Harry</PER> to the wand and the curse it had just cast.
“But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?” <PER>Harry</PER> acted without thinking: Pointing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at Travers, <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, “Imperiol” once more.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at Travers, who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made <PER>Harry</PER>'s decision: With a flick of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand wand made Travers come with them, walking meekly in them's wake as them reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches.
“their’re Imperiused,” he added, in response to <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank.
“What are you making him do?” “Hide,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front with Griphook, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> crammed together in the back.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks: <PER>Harry</PER> hair flew behind <PER>Harry</PER> as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but <PER>Harry</PER> kept glancing back.
They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more <PER>Harry</PER> thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised <PER>Hermione</PER> as Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix’s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it — They were deeper than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever penetrated within Gringotts; They took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of They, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track.
Water filled <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes and mouth: <PER>Harry</PER> could not see or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of the cart.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard <PER>Hermione</PER> shriek something, and felt <PER>Harry</PER> glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor.
“C-Cushioning Charm,” <PER>Hermione</PER> spluttered, as <PER>Ron</PER> pulled her to her feet, but to <PER>Harry</PER>’s horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; <PER>Ron</PER> was red-haired and beardless again.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think I can hear people coming!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the waterfall and cried, “Protego\” They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway.
<PER>Harry</PER> was trying to listen: <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> could hear something clanking and moving around nearby.
“Griphook, how much farther?” “Not far, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, not far ” And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which <PER>Harry</PER> had been prepared, but which still brought all of them to a halt.
“You know what to do,” Griphook told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see it trembling, and as they drew nearer <PER>Harry</PER> saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guessed that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers.
<PER>Harry</PER> as they all hurried inside the vault had described Hufflepuff’s cup to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know what it looked like.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had lit their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them.
“It burned me!” moaned <PER>Hermione</PER>, sucking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s blistered fingers.
“Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless — and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!” “Okay, don’t touch anything!” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, but even as <PER>Harry</PER> said it, <PER>Ron</PER> accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded into being while <PER>Ron</PER> hopped on the spot, part of <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.
“Stand still, don’t move!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, clutching at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s wandlight passed over shields and goblin- made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher <PER>Harry</PER> raised the beam, until suddenly it found an object that made <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart skip and <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand tremble.
“It’s there, It’s up there\” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> pointed their wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>.
The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and back as <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then <PER>Harry</PER> heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and saw terror in their faces.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as the clanking grew louder, “I’ve got to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it — ” She raised Shis wand, pointed it at <PER>Harry</PER>, and whispered, “Levicorpus.” Hoisted into the air by his ankle, <PER>Harry</PER> hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped space.
With screams of pain <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate.
“Impervius\” screeched <PER>Hermione</PER> in an attempt to protect herself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and the goblins from the burning metal.
Then the worst scream yet made <PER>Harry</PER> look down: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view.
“Liberacorpus\” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, and with a crash <PER>Harry</PER> and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
“Get it!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin, as Griphook clambered onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects.
One hand holding tightly to a fistful of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hair, to make sure <PER>Harry</PER> did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s reach.
The goblin still astride him, <PER>Harry</PER> dived and caught it, and although <PER>Harry</PER> could feel it scalding <PER>Harry</PER>'s flesh <PER>Harry</PER> did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist, raining down upon <PER>Harry</PER> as the entrance of the vault opened up again and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> into the outer chamber.
Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure, <PER>Harry</PER> shoved the cup into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone.
Sliding from <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulders the moment he could, <PER>Harry</PER> had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, “Thieves!
Slipping on the hot metal, <PER>Harry</PER> struggled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and knew that the only way out was through.
“Stupefyl” he bellowed, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw several wizard guards running around the corner.
Pointing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “Relashiol” The cuffs broke open with loud bangs.
“This way!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing goblins, <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted toward the blind dragon.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> — what are you doing?” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Get up, climb up, come on — ” The dragon had not realized that The dragon was free: <PER>Harry</PER>’s foot found the crook of The dragon hind leg and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> up onto the crook of its hind leg back.
<PER>Harry</PER> stretched out an arm; <PER>Hermione</PER> hoisted herself up; <PER>Ron</PER> climbed on behind them, and a second later the dragon became aware that it was untethered.
With a roar it reared: <PER>Harry</PER> dug in <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, clutching as tightly as <PER>Harry</PER> could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, flat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crashing of rock and the dragon’s roars, <PER>Harry</PER> could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> yelling, “Defodiol” <PER>Hermione</PER> was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as the ceiling struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins: <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> copied <PER>Hermione</PER>, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells.
Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally dragon had room to stretch the dragon wings: Turning finally dragon horned head toward finally dragon could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> still clinging to its back, its forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from them's hinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky.
Crouching low over the beast’s neck, <PER>Harry</PER> clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s burned and blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill.
Behind <PER>Harry</PER>, whether from delight or fear <PER>Harry</PER> could not tell, <PER>Ron</PER> kept swearing at the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be sobbing.
After five minutes or so, <PER>Harry</PER> lost some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from the dragon underground prison as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced around constantly, imagining that <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar prickling.
<PER>Harry</PER> hands were numb with cold but <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare attempt to shift <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip.
“Is it my imagination,” shouted <PER>Ron</PER> after a considerable stretch of silence, “or are we losing height?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset.
The landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as <PER>Harry</PER> squinted over the side of the dragon, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight.
“Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!” They agreed, <PER>Hermione</PER> a little faintly, and now <PER>Harry</PER> could see the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water.
<PER>Harry</PER> slithered over the side of the dragon’s and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than <PER>Harry</PER> had estimated and <PER>Harry</PER> hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, reed-filled world.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had fallen.
As <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of the lake, The dragon flew on, the dragon wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant bank.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> struck out for the opposite shore.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> could have happily lain down and slept, <PER>Harry</PER> staggered to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, drew out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and started casting the usual protective spells around them.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, <PER>Harry</PER> joined the others.
<PER>Hermione</PER> handed <PER>Harry</PER> the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice <PER>Hermione</PER> had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them.
“That double-crossing little scab ” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket <PER>Harry</PER> had just taken off and set the Horcrux down on the grass in front of them.
“Will it be all right?” “You sound like <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s ribs ached, <PER>Harry</PER> felt lightheaded with hunger, but <PER>Harry</PER> lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat was raw.
“What are we going to do, though?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> finally, hiccuping <PER>Hermione</PER> back to seriousness.
“Maybe they’ll cover up — ” The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice were extinguished: Pain cleaved <PER>Harry</PER>’s head like a sword stroke.
<PER>Harry</PER> was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced <PER>Harry</PER>, and on the floor at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet knelt a small, quaking figure.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had always suspected him; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, dead on his orders; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, whose wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy — But surely if the boy had destroyed any of the boy's Horcruxes, he, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, would have known, would have felt it?
He, the greatest wizard of them all; He, the most powerful; he, the killer of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and of how many other worthless, nameless men: How could Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> not have known, if Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated?
True, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had thought that was because Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had no body to feel, being less than ghost.
Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hiding places, it was there that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would go first.
The lake, surely impossible though was there a slight possibility that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might have known some of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s past misdeeds, through the orphanage.
To tell <PER>Snape</PER> why the boy might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and <PER>Malfoy</PER>: Didn’t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes flew open as <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched <PER>Harry</PER> back to the present: <PER>Harry</PER> was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> knows, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s going to check where the others are, and the last one,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> was already on <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s feet, “is at Hogwarts.
“No, he was concentrating on warning <PER>Snape</PER>, he didn’t think about exactly where it is — ” “Wait, wait\” cried <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> caught up the Horcrux and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again.
“Can you imagine what <PER>Harry</PER>’s going to do once <PER>Harry</PER> realizes the ring and the locket are gone?
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> walked forward and took <PER>Hermione</PER>'s place between the other two.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains beyond the village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the heart <PER>Harry</PER>’s remembered, with piercing accuracy, how <PER>Harry</PER>’s had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; all this in a second, upon landing — and then, even as <PER>Harry</PER>’s relaxed <PER>Harry</PER>’s's grip upon <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms, it happened.
The air was rent by a scream that sounded like <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s when <PER>Voldemort</PER> had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in <PER>Harry</PER>’s body, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew immediately that their appearance had caused it.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Ron</PER>’s wrist as <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand; there were too many of them to Stun: Even attempting it would give away Stun's position.
“Disapparate now!” “Great idea,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could reply a Death Eater shouted, “We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting away!
“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> retreated down the side street, groping He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s way along the wall, trying not to make a sound.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths <PER>Harry</PER> detested, tasting despair on the air, closing in — <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand: <PER>Harry</PER> could not, would not, suffer the Dementor’s Kiss, whatever happened afterward.
It was of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> that he thought as he whispered, “Expecto Patronum).” The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight.
<PER>Harry</PER> had had no idea where they were, but now <PER>Harry</PER> saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust- strewn bar of the Hog’s Head Inn.
<PER>Harry</PER> drew the curtains tight shut, then pulled the Cloak off himself and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“How did you get this?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, walking across to Sirius’s mirror, the twin of the one <PER>Harry</PER> had broken nearly two years before.
“Right then,” said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat slumped dozily in their chairs.
“Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> rather timidly.
“Been reading <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, have you, missy?” Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that <PER>Hermione</PER> had turned red.
“Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to spare <PER>Hermione</PER>.
He met Aberforth ’s gaze, which was so strikingly like He's brother’s: The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought that Aberforth knew what <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking and despised <PER>Harry</PER> for it.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cared about <PER>Harry</PER>, very much,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low voice.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s face was wet with tears, and <PER>Ron</PER> was almost as pale as Aberforth.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt nothing but revulsion: <PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had not heard it, wished <PER>Harry</PER> could wash <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind clean of it.
“He thought He was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know He did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, remembering <PER>Dumbledore</PER> whimpering, pleading.
“Why didn’t he say to him, Take care of yourself, here’s how to survive’?” “Because,” said <PER>Harry</PER> before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer, “sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your own safety!
“Your brother knew how to finish <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> passed the knowledge on to me.
The longer <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Neville</PER>, the worse <PER>Harry</PER> appeared: One of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s general air of unkemptness suggested that <PER>Harry</PER> had been living rough.
Nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER>'s battered visage shone with happiness as <PER>Harry</PER> let go of <PER>Hermione</PER> and said again, “I knew you’d come!
“<PER>Hermione</PER> was all for keeping it as a pet — ” “Don’t exaggerate, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “But what have you been doing?
“These have been great,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, beaming at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
As <PER>Harry</PER> followed, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Neville</PER> call out to unseen people: “Look who it is!
The next moment, he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair ruffled, he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people: he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> might just have won a Quidditch final.
“Okay, okay, calm down!” <PER>Neville</PER> called, and as the crowd backed away, <PER>Harry</PER> was able to take in their surroundings.
“No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had not recognized until <PER>Harry</PER> spoke: Seamus’s face was bruised and puffy.
As <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and <PER>Harry</PER> was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s scream of fury vibrated inside <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s head.
With an enormous effort he pulled out of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and <PER>Ron</PER> holding him up.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Neville</PER> was saying.
He looked at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, trying to tell them without words that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes.
He was exercising all He's willpower to prevent He succumbing again to <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s rage: <PER>Voldemort</PER> scar was still burning.
“Well, there’s something we — <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and I — need to do, and then we’ll get out of here.” Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore.
“What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?” “We haven’t come back to stay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar, trying to soothe the pain.
“Because ” In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about where they might commence their search, <PER>Harry</PER> found it difficult to gather <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> left the three of us a job,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to tell — I mean, — wanted we to do it, just the three of we.” “we’re —'s army,” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
“What we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “Then let us help!” said <PER>Neville</PER> angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart seemed to fail: <PER>Ginny</PER> was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan.
<PER>Ginny</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a radiant smile: <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how beautiful <PER>Ginny</PER> was, but <PER>Harry</PER> had never been less pleased to see <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Right behind Lee Jordan came <PER>Harry</PER>’s old girlfriend, <PER>Cho</PER> Chang.
“There isn’t one,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar was still burning so fiercely.
“You’ve got to stop this!” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> turned suddenly to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had warned <PER>Dumbledore</PER> against telling anyone but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about the Horcruxes.
But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had trusted <PER>Snape</PER>, and where had that led?
“Centuries ago, they say,” said <PER>Cho</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart sank.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s own disappointment was mirrored back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, <PER>Voldemort</PER> did not know: Either way, there was hardly any time left.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s on the move,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said quietly to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“How do we get out?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Over here.” <PER>Harry</PER> led <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase.
They were standing in a dark corridor: <PER>Harry</PER> pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map.
<PER>Harry</PER> had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on <PER>Harry</PER>'s safe passage through the place.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust <PER>Harry</PER> had seen at Luna’s house.
The sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before <PER>Harry</PER>, and even as <PER>Harry</PER> raised his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on shis forearm.
The moment shis finger touched the Mark, <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar burned savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and <PER>Harry</PER> was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing around <PER>Harry</PER> and there was triumph in <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart — They have the boy.
A loud bang brought <PER>Harry</PER> back to where <PER>Harry</PER> stood: Disoriented, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, but the witch before <PER>Harry</PER> was already falling forward; the witch before <PER>Harry</PER> hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled.
“They’re pleased!” “Yeah great ” <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind.
Then, just as <PER>Harry</PER> was wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door.
“I’ll Cruciate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it — and what’s <PER>Voldemort</PER> going to say?” ’s <PER>Voldemort</PER> shrieked, standing over ’s <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s sister and smacking ’s <PER>Voldemort</PER> on the forehead with ’s <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s fist.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Cloak off <PER>Harry</PER>, raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and said, “You shouldn’t have done that.” As Amycus spun around, <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, “Crucio\” The Death Eater was lifted off The Death Eater's feet.
“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, the blood thundering through <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain, “you need to really mean it.” “Potter!” whispered Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, clutching her heart.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s on the way.” “Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak.
“He already knows where I am.” In a distant part of <PER>Harry</PER>’s brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Voldemort</PER> sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> or Luna could act, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> rose to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s feet, pointed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wand at the groggy Death Eater, and said, “Imperio.” Amycus got up, walked over to Amycus's sister, picked up Amycus's wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and handed it over along with his own.
“Potter,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning to face him again with superb indifference to the Carrows’ predicament, “if <PER>Voldemort</PER> does indeed know that you are here — ” As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through <PER>Harry</PER>, setting <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar on fire, and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface — “Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and <PER>Harry</PER> came back: <PER>Harry</PER> was clutching Luna’s shoulder to steady <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students — ” “I know, Professor, but if <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the Death Eaters won’t be interested in anyone who’s Disapparating out of the Hog’s Head.” “There’s something in that,” she agreed.
The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and Luna hurried back down.
Along the corridors they raced, and one by one The Patronuses left them; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER>, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first: He felt in the pouch around He's neck for the Marauder’s Map, but before He could take it out, <PER>McGonagall</PER> too seemed to become aware of their company.
Hatred boiled up in <PER>Harry</PER> at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> had forgotten the details of Severus <PER>Snape</PER> ’s appearance in the magnitude of <PER>Harry</PER>'s crimes, forgotten how <PER>Harry</PER>'s greasy black hair hung in curtains around <PER>Harry</PER>'s thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual black cloak, and <PER>Harry</PER> too was holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand ready for a fight.
<PER>Snape</PER> stepped nearer, and <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes flitted over Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> into the air around her, as if <PER>Snape</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was there.
<PER>Harry</PER> held <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand up too, ready to attack.
“I was under the impression,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, “that Alecto had apprehended an intruder.” “Really?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“And what gave you that impression?” <PER>Snape</PER> made a slight flexing movement of <PER>Snape</PER>'s left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into <PER>Snape</PER>'s skin.
“You Death Eaters have your own private means of communication, I forgot.” <PER>Snape</PER> pretended not to have heard <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> eyes were still probing the air all about her, and <PER>Snape</PER> was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what <PER>Snape</PER> was doing.
She brandished Shis wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of it bracket: <PER>Harry</PER>, about to curse <PER>Snape</PER>, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at <PER>Snape</PER> Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that <PER>McGonagall</PER> blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers: <PER>Snape</PER> avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast — “Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in them's nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.
<PER>Snape</PER> struggled free of the crushing arms and sent the crushing arms flying back toward <PER>Snape</PER>'s attackers: <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered.
When <PER>Harry</PER> looked up again, <PER>Snape</PER> was in full flight, <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after him: him hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, him heard <PER>McGonagall</PER> cry, “Coward!
<PER>Harry</PER> dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window.
“He jumped,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna ran into the room.
“You mean he’s dead?” <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at <PER>Harry</PER>'s sudden appearance.
“Unlike <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, he was still carrying a wand and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.” With a tingle of horror, <PER>Harry</PER> saw in the distance a huge, batlike shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.
“Professor!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands at <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, beckoning to <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna to follow her.
“Go and wake your students, Horace.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna ran after Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand.
“Now, Potter,” said <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “you and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.” They parted at the top of the next staircase, <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna running back toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement.
“That was Potter!” “ <PER>Harry</PER> Potted” “It was him, I swear, I just saw him!” But <PER>Harry</PER> did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting <PER>Harry</PER> at the foot of the stairs.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s on his way, they’re barricading the school — <PER>Snape</PER>’s run for it — What are you doing here?
“We’re fighting.” There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past he, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle.
“Why doesn’t <PER>Ginny</PER> stay here, then at least <PER>Ginny</PER>’ll be on the scene and know what’s going on, but <PER>Ginny</PER> won’t be in the middle of the fighting?” “That’s a good idea,” said Arthur firmly.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, you stay in this room, you hear me?” <PER>Ginny</PER> did not seem to like the idea much, but under <PER>Ginny</PER>'s father’s unusually stern gaze, <PER>Ginny</PER> nodded.
“Where’s <PER>Ron</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They said something about a bathroom,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, “not long after you left.” “A bathroom?” <PER>Harry</PER> strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of Requirement and checked the bathroom beyond.
However, as <PER>Harry</PER> skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, “And what if we want to stay and fight?” There was a smattering of applause.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Give me <PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s voice, “and none shall be harmed.
Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found <PER>Harry</PER>, to hold <PER>Harry</PER> frozen in the glare of thousands of invisible beams.
Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with them's backs to <PER>Harry</PER>, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and <PER>Harry</PER>, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.
“Where are <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Haven’t you found — ?” began Arthur, looking worried.
“All right, leaders up here and we’ll divide up the troops!” “Potter,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, hurrying up to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, as students flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, “ Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?” “What?
Without <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to help him He could not seem to marshal He's ideas.
He could not see <PER>Ron</PER>’s or <PER>Hermione</PER>’s names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, He thought, be concealing them.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could only be one explanation: <PER>Voldemort</PER> feared that <PER>Harry</PER> already knew <PER>Harry</PER>'s Horcrux was connected to that House.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way <PER>Harry</PER> had come, now in pursuit of <PER>Harry</PER>'s one last hope.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as <PER>Harry</PER> could over the clamor.
“That’s her over there, <PER>Harry</PER>, the young woman with the long hair.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER> looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall.
Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, <PER>Harry</PER> saw shis at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from <PER>Harry</PER>.
Close to, <PER>Harry</PER> recognized Shis as a ghost <PER>Harry</PER> had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom <PER>Harry</PER> had never spoken.
“It’s about <PER>Voldemort</PER> — defeating <PER>Voldemort</PER> — or aren’t you interested in that?” her could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated as her replied, “Of course I — how dare you suggest — ?” “Well, help me, then!” her composure was slipping.
“There’s no time to explain — but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see <PER>Voldemort</PER> finished, you’ve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!” She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and a sense of hopelessness engulfed <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, you weren’t the first person <PER>Riddle</PER> wormed things out of,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
“<PER>Harry</PER> could be charming when <PER>Harry</PER> wanted.
<PER>Harry</PER> had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from the diadem hiding place, perhaps as soon as <PER>Harry</PER> left Hogwarts, before <PER>Harry</PER> even started work at Borgin and Burkes.
No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> must have put it there — “ — the night he asked for a job!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, finishing his thought.
“I beg your pardon?” “He hid the diadem in the castle, the night He asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to let <PER>Dumbledore</PER> teach!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> must’ve hidden the diadem on <PER>Harry</PER>'s way up to, or down from, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s office!
What hiding place had Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> discovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that Tom <PER>Riddle</PER> believed would remain secret forever?
Lost in desperate speculation, <PER>Harry</PER> turned a corner, but <PER>Harry</PER> had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound’s attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet.
“I’ll see yer in a moment, there’s a good lad!” Beyond <PER>Hagrid</PER>, out in the dark night, <PER>Harry</PER> saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird, keening scream.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch: It was midnight.
“Blimey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” panted <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “this is it, eh?
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, <PER>Harry</PER> could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds.
“Where’re we goin’?” puffed <PER>Hagrid</PER>, pounding along at <PER>Harry</PER>’s heels, making the floorboards quake.
“I dunno exactly,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, making another random turn, “but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> must be around here somewhere.
The shock shot through <PER>Harry</PER> with the heat of firewhisky, and <PER>Harry</PER> nearly stumbled.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for <PER>Harry</PER>.
Of course, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had strayed off the beaten track in <PER>Harry</PER>'s time at school — here at last was a secret he and <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had never discovered — he was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by <PER>Neville</PER> and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.
“Mandrakes!” <PER>Neville</PER> bellowed at <PER>Harry</PER> over his shoulder as <PER>Harry</PER> ran.
“Going to lob them over the walls — they won’t like this!” <PER>Harry</PER> knew now where to go: <PER>Harry</PER> sped off, with <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Fang galloping behind him.
“It’s all righ’, Fang — it’s all righ’!” yelled <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> alone.
<PER>Harry</PER> forged on through the trembling passages, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clanking along in him's armor, screaming encouragement, him's fat little pony cantering behind him.
“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels out, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, see Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels off!” <PER>Harry</PER> hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway.
“I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!” “I know, we’re evacuating,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s “ — attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah,” said Aberforth, “I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him.
Well, it was the truth, <PER>Harry</PER> thought as <PER>Harry</PER> ran on again; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had defended <PER>Snape</PER> for so long, would never have held students ransom.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury <PER>Harry</PER> saw them: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, <PER>Ron</PER> with a broomstick under his arm.
“It was <PER>Ron</PER>, all <PER>Ron</PER>’s idea!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms: great curved fangs, torn, <PER>Harry</PER> now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk.
“Show him, <PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> made a horrible strangled hissing noise.
It was empty except for three women: <PER>Ginny</PER>, Tonks, and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom <PER>Harry</PER> recognized immediately as <PER>Neville</PER>’s grandmother.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too.
<PER>Ron</PER> threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted <PER>Hermione</PER> off her feet.
“Is this the moment?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
“I know, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, “so it’s now or never, isn’t it?” “Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“D’you think you could just — just hold it in until we’ve got the diadem?” “Yeah — right — sorry — ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and he and <PER>Hermione</PER> set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.
It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the nearest window, <PER>Harry</PER> saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that <PER>Harry</PER> knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place.
Looking down, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring <PER>Harry</PER>'s displeasure.
“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: <PER>Harry</PER> turned and saw <PER>Ginny</PER> and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes.
“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw Aberforth again, <PER>Harry</PER>'s gray hair flying as <PER>Harry</PER> led a small group of students past.
<PER>Ginny</PER> turned, helpless, to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“They’ll be all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, though <PER>Harry</PER> knew They were empty words.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe — come on!” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant.
I need the place where everything is hidden, <PER>Harry</PER> begged of it inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, and the door materialized on their third run past.
“Somewhere near here,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Through the small space between their leering faces he saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Not anymore,” panted <PER>Harry</PER>, tightening <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip on the hawthorn wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not hear <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> anymore.
“So how come you three aren’t with <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s Potter <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants, who cares about a die-dum?” “Potter came in here to get it,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> with ill- disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues, “so that must mean — ” “ ‘Must mean?” Crabbe turned on <PER>Malfoy</PER> with undisguised ferocity.
“STOP!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> shouted at Crabbe, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s voice echoing through the enormous room.
“But if I can, I will, <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants him dead anyway, what’s thediff— ?” A jet of scarlet light shot past <PER>Harry</PER> by inches: <PER>Hermione</PER> had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe ’s head.
“ Expelliarmusl” Goyle ’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve the spot; <PER>Malfoy</PER> jumped out of range of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s second Stunning Spell, and <PER>Ron</PER>, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking terrified; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them.
<PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them.
“What can we do?” “Here!” <PER>Harry</PER> seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to <PER>Ron</PER>, who pulled <PER>Hermione</PER> onto it behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see a trace of <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere: <PER>Harry</PER> swooped as low as <PER>Harry</PER> dared over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed <PER>Ron</PER>, though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke.
“It’s — too — dangerous — !” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, but <PER>Harry</PER> wheeled in the air.
<PER>Harry</PER> glasses giving <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes some small protection from the smoke, <PER>Harry</PER> raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood.
And <PER>Harry</PER> saw them: <PER>Malfoy</PER> with <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and <PER>Harry</PER> dived.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> coming and raised one arm, but even as <PER>Harry</PER> grasped it <PER>Harry</PER> knew at once that it was no good: Goyle was too heavy and <PER>Malfoy</PER> ’s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s — roared <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and <PER>Hermione</PER> dragged Goyle onto he and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as <PER>Malfoy</PER> clambered up behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed <PER>Malfoy</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear, and <PER>Harry</PER> sped up, following <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara — “ What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s that way\” screamed <PER>Malfoy</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> made a hairpin swerve and dived.
The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist — <PER>Harry</PER> swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; ] wrist — <PER>Harry</PER> soared upward and straight toward the place where, ] wrist — <PER>Harry</PER> prayed, the door stood open: <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Goyle had vanished; <PER>Malfoy</PER> was screaming and holding <PER>Harry</PER> so tightly it hurt.
Then, through the smoke, <PER>Harry</PER> saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at a rectangular patch on the wall, and moments later clean air filled <PER>Harry</PER>'s lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.
<PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious.
“C-Crabbe,” choked <PER>Malfoy</PER> as soon as <PER>Harry</PER> could speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> staggered to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all around him.
“Where’s <PER>Ginny</PER>?” Where’s <PER>Ginny</PER>?
“Shall we split up and look — ?” “No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, getting to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet too.
Suddenly <PER>Harry</PER> felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, and as it did so, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
“Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose hair, like <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, was singed, and whose face was blackened.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then the man dueling Percy's hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair — “Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort.
They had been grouped together, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> flying through the air, and all <PER>Harry</PER> could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was <PER>Harry</PER>'s one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of He's companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them — And then the world resolved the world into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack.
And <PER>Hermione</PER> was struggling to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart.
<PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood.
“Get down!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, as more curses flew through the night: <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had both grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> and pulled <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred’s body, shielding Fred’s body from further harm, and when <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, “Percy, come on, we’ve got to move!” Percy shook Percy's head.
“Percy!” <PER>Harry</PER> saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating <PER>Ron</PER>’s face as <PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s elder brother’s shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge.
Then more curses came soaring over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head, so close <PER>Harry</PER> felt the force of them blow <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair.
“Let’s move, NOW!” Pushing <PER>Hermione</PER> ahead of him with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> stooped to seize Fred’s body under the armpits.
“Here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and they placed <PER>Harry</PER> in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than <PER>Harry</PER> had to, and after making sure that the body was well hidden, <PER>Harry</PER> took off after <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, <PER>Harry</PER> saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes <PER>Harry</PER> could not tell.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, in here!” <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed.
She had pulled <PER>Ron</PER> behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second <PER>Harry</PER> thought that They were embracing again; then <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hermione</PER> was trying to restrain <PER>Ron</PER>, to stop him running after Percy.
But <PER>Harry</PER> knew how <PER>Ron</PER> felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge; <PER>Harry</PER> too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that <PER>Ginny</PER> was not — but <PER>Harry</PER> could not permit that idea to form in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind — “We will fight!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said.
“You need to find out where <PER>Voldemort</PER> is, because hell have the snake with <PER>Voldemort</PER>, won’t he?
<PER>Voldemort</PER> closed <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and the bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them.
He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem although <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s puppet had come much farther than <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had ever expected too far .
He turned: There was Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER> had received after the boy’s last escape.
“Go and fetch <PER>Snape</PER>.” “<PER>Snape</PER>, m-my Lord?” <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> continued to stand there, twirling the wand between <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s fingers, staring at it.
“It is the only way, Nagini,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> whispered, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space <PER>Voldemort</PER> had made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank.
With a gasp, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled back and opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes; at the same moment <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle.
“You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as soon as I — ” “No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and — ” “Don’t even think about it,” <PER>Ron</PER> snarled at her.
Before <PER>Hermione</PER> could get farther than “<PER>Ron</PER>, I’m just as capable — ” the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open.
Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before Two masked Death Eaters's wands were fully raised, <PER>Hermione</PER> shouted, “Glisseo\” The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters’ Stunning Spells flew far over their heads.
“Duro\” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, pointing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it.
“Get back!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>, and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> flattened <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherded by a sprinting Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
As she turned the corner, they heard shis scream, “CHARGE!” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you get the Cloak on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if their cast curses.
“Argh!” A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over <PER>Ron</PER>’s head; the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair as <PER>Ron</PER> tried to shake them loose.
“LET’S GO!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
“I’m <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I’m <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I’m on your side!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death Eater.
<PER>Harry</PER> Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked around, beaming, for <PER>Harry</PER>'s savior, and <PER>Ron</PER> punched <PER>Harry</PER> from under the Cloak.
<PER>Harry</PER> directed a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit <PER>Neville</PER>, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sped down the marble staircase: Glass shattered to their left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as people ran.
“NO!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>, and with a deafening blast from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly stirring body of Lavender Brown.
“How do we get out?” yelled <PER>Ron</PER> over all the screaming, but before either <PER>Harry</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer they were bowled aside: <PER>Hagrid</PER> had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing <PER>Harry</PER>'s flowery pink umbrella.
<PER>Harry</PER> forgot everything else: <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted out from under the Cloak, running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was not even halfway to <PER>Hagrid</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> saw it happen: <PER>Hagrid</PER> vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, <PER>Hagrid</PER> buried in their midst.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard someone calling <PER>Harry</PER>'s own name, whether friend or foe <PER>Harry</PER> did not care: <PER>Harry</PER> was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with the spiders's prey, and <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing of <PER>Hagrid</PER> at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as <PER>Harry</PER> made to chase after them, <PER>Harry</PER>'s way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which <PER>Harry</PER> stood shudder.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up: A giant stood before <PER>Harry</PER>, twenty feet high, A giant head hidden in shadow, nothing but A giant treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors.
With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon <PER>Harry</PER>, forcing <PER>Harry</PER> back under the shelter of the doorway.
“Oh my — !” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> caught up with <PER>Harry</PER> and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above.
“DONT!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, grabbing <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand as she raised shis wand.
“RUN!” <PER>Harry</PER> roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and <PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, <PER>Ron</PER> bringing up the rear.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not lost hope of finding and saving <PER>Hagrid</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again.
The air around them had frozen: <PER>Harry</PER>’s breath caught and solidified in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> closed in beside <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred was gone, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was surely dying or already dead.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice from a very long way away.
He saw <PER>Ron</PER>’s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; He saw <PER>Hermione</PER>’s otter twist in midair and fade; and He's own wand trembled in He's hand, and He almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling .
And then a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s heads: The dementors fell back before the creatures’ approach.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked round: <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were following <PER>Harry</PER>, but the other three had vanished back into the battle.
“The Whomping Willow,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “go!” Somehow Somehow walled it all up in Somehow's mind, crammed it into a small space into which Somehow could not look now: Thoughts of Fred and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and his terror for all the people his loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, because that was, as <PER>Hermione</PER> said, the only way to end it — He sprinted, half believing He could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around He, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, He ran faster than He had ever moved in He's life, and it was He who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at the great tree roots with whiplike, slashing branches.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> caught up, <PER>Hermione</PER> so out of breath <PER>Hermione</PER> could not speak.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> wanted <PER>Harry</PER> to do this, wanted <PER>Harry</PER> to come.
Was he leading <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> into a trap?
But then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: The only way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was at the end of this tunnel.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, we’re coming, just get in there!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pushing <PER>Harry</PER> forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> went first, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came.
They moved in silence, <PER>Harry</PER>’s gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist.
<PER>Hermione</PER> tugged at <PER>Harry</PER>'s ankle.
Then <PER>Snape</PER> spoke, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart lurched: <PER>Snape</PER> was inches away from where <PER>Snape</PER> crouched, hidden. "
my Lord, their resistance is crumbling — ” “ — and it is doing so without your help,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s high, clear voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of <PER>Harry</PER> gleaming slightly in the semidarkness.
“Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?” In the silence <PER>Harry</PER> imagined <PER>Harry</PER> could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled — or was it <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s sibilant sigh lingering on the air?
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see <PER>Harry</PER>'s face: <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Snape</PER> sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure <PER>Harry</PER>'s master.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> started to move around the room: <PER>Harry</PER> lost sight of <PER>Harry</PER> for seconds as <PER>Voldemort</PER> prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” “I — I cannot answer that, my Lord.” “Can’t you?” The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through <PER>Harry</PER>’s head: He forced He's own fist into He's mouth to stop He from crying out in pain.
He closed He's eyes, and suddenly He was <PER>Voldemort</PER>, looking into <PER>Snape</PER>’s pale face.
“My Lord — let me go to the boy — ” “All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s voice barely louder than a whisper, “wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for it rightful owner and I think I have the answer.” <PER>Snape</PER> did not speak.
It did nothing to <PER>Snape</PER>, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: But then <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s intention became clear.
The snake’s cage was rolling through the air, and before <PER>Snape</PER> could do anything more than yell, The snake’s cage had encased him, head and shoulders, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> spoke in Parseltongue.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face losing the little color <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face had left; <PER>Snape</PER> ’s face whitened as <PER>Harry</PER>'s black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs pierced his neck, as his failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and himself fell to the floor.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> turned away; there was no sadness in <PER>Voldemort</PER>, no remorse.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent floated after <PER>Voldemort</PER> in its huge protective sphere.
Back in the tunnel and <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own mind, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes: <PER>Harry</PER> had drawn blood biting down on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knuckles in the effort not to shout out.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” breathed <PER>Hermione</PER> behind him, but him had already pointed him's wand at the crate blocking him's view.
<PER>Harry</PER> took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down upon the man <PER>Harry</PER> hated, whose widening black eyes found <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent over <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER> seized the front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> close.
Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew what it was, but did not know what to do — A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> lifted the silvery substance into the silvery substance with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
When the flask was full to the brim, and <PER>Snape</PER> looked as though there was no blood left in <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>'s grip on <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes slackened.
The hand holding <PER>Harry</PER> thudded to the floor, and <PER>Snape</PER> moved no more.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained kneeling at <PER>Snape</PER>’s side, simply staring down at <PER>Harry</PER>, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that <PER>Harry</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, the flask gripped tightly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, thinking that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had reentered the room.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER> was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if him stood beside them, him's breath on the back of them's necks, a deathblow away.
<PER>Harry</PER> gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what to feel, except shock at the way <PER>Snape</PER> had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done.
They crawled back through the tunnel, none of They talking, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> could still hear <PER>Voldemort</PER> ringing in their heads, as <PER>Voldemort</PER> could.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see Fred’s body, because <PER>Harry</PER>'s family surrounded him.
Without a word to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked away.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> approach <PER>Ginny</PER>, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her.
<PER>Ron</PER> joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around <PER>Ron</PER>’s shoulders.
As <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved closer to the rest of the family, <PER>Harry</PER> had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if <PER>Harry</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> up in the first place, Fred might never have died.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of <PER>Snape</PER>’s last thoughts, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not slow down until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office.
“Password?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER> without thinking, because it was <PER>Harry</PER> whom <PER>Harry</PER> yearned to see, and to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase behind.
But when <PER>Harry</PER> burst into the circular office <PER>Harry</PER> found a change.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced hopelessly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it.
The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where The stone Pensieve had always been: <PER>Harry</PER> heaved The stone Pensieve onto the desk and poured <PER>Snape</PER>’s memories into the wide basin with the desk runic markings around the edge.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell headlong into sunlight, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet found warm ground.
When <PER>Harry</PER> straightened up, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> was in a nearly deserted playground.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” <PER>Snape</PER> could no longer contain <PER>Snape</PER>, but had jumped out from behind the bushes.
<PER>Snape</PER> seemed to regret <PER>Snape</PER>'s appearance.
With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, <PER>Snape</PER> lowered <PER>Snape</PER>'s voice and said, “I know what you are.” “What do you mean?” “You’re you’re a witch,” whispered <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was highly colored now, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered why <PER>Snape</PER> did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because <PER>Snape</PER> did not want to reveal the smock beneath the smock.
<PER>Snape</PER> flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like <PER>Snape</PER>'s older self.
He stood watching them as them marched through the playground gate, and <PER>Harry</PER>, the only one left to observe him, recognized <PER>Snape</PER> ’s bitter disappointment, and understood that <PER>Snape</PER> had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong .
The scene dissolved, and before <PER>Harry</PER> knew it, re- formed around <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> had removed <PER>Snape</PER>'s coat now; <PER>Snape</PER>'s odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light. "
“Definitely,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, and even with <PER>Snape</PER>'s poorly cut hair and <PER>Snape</PER>'s odd clothes, <PER>Snape</PER> struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in <PER>Snape</PER>'s destiny.
<PER>Snape</PER> picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what <PER>Snape</PER> was doing.
“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but <PER>Snape</PER> had jumped to <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around: <PER>Harry</PER> was on platform nine and three-quarters, and <PER>Snape</PER> stood beside <PER>Harry</PER>, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly resembled <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> had already changed into <PER>Snape</PER>'s school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off <PER>Snape</PER>'s dreadful Muggle clothes.
<PER>Snape</PER> glanced at <PER>Snape</PER> and then looked back out of the window.
“Slytherin?” One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or <PER>Snape</PER> until that point, looked around at the word, and <PER>Harry</PER>, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like <PER>Snape</PER>, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that <PER>Snape</PER> so conspicuously lacked.
<PER>Harry</PER> was standing right behind <PER>Snape</PER> as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces.
Then Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said, “Evans, Lily!” <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> dropped the Sorting Hat onto Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, “ Gryffindoii” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Snape</PER> let out a tiny groan.
Lily took off the hat, handed the hat back to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as Lily went Lily glanced back at <PER>Snape</PER>, and there was a sad little smile on Lily's face.
her took one look at <PER>Harry</PER>, seemed to recognize <PER>Harry</PER> from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table.
At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> called <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked with him to the stool, watched <PER>Harry</PER> place the hat upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
And Severus <PER>Snape</PER> moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted <PER>Snape</PER> on the back as <PER>Snape</PER> sat down beside <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried to catch up with Lily and <PER>Snape</PER>, to listen in.
As <PER>Harry</PER> reached them, <PER>Harry</PER> realized how much taller they both were: A few years seemed to have passed since them's Sorting. "
<PER>Harry</PER> watched again as <PER>Snape</PER> left the Great Hall after sitting <PER>Harry</PER>'s O.W.L.
But <PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s distance this time, because <PER>Harry</PER> knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; him knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again.
Distantly he heard <PER>Snape</PER> shout at <PER>Snape</PER>'s in <PER>Snape</PER>'s humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “MudbloocL.” The scene changed.
The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until <PER>Harry</PER>'s surroundings solidified again and <PER>Harry</PER> stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees.
His fear infected <PER>Harry</PER> too, even though <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> could not be harmed, and <PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, wondering what it was that <PER>Snape</PER> was waiting for — Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: <PER>Harry</PER> thought of lightning, but <PER>Snape</PER> had dropped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.
He stood before <PER>Snape</PER> with He's robes whipping around <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER>'s face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand.
“How much did you relay to Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” “Everything — everything I heard!” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was slumped forward in a chair and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing over <PER>Snape</PER>, looking grim.
After a moment or two, <PER>Snape</PER> raised <PER>Snape</PER>'s face, and <PER>Snape</PER> looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.
“If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved Lily Evans, then your way forward is clear.” <PER>Snape</PER> seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s words appeared to take a long time to reach <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was pacing up and down in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“ — mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent — ” “You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, without raising <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today.
<PER>Snape</PER> was muttering incantations, pointing <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand his tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s throat.
“That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain That ring is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio.
The news that <PER>Snape</PER> had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to say more on the subject of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further.
Scowling, <PER>Snape</PER> said, “The Dark Lord does not expect <PER>Malfoy</PER> to succeed.
“That, I think, is <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s plan.” “Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> foresees a moment in the near future when “Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> will not need a spy at Hogwarts?” “““Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> believes the school will soon be in “Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s grasp, yes.” “And if it does fall into his grasp,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, almost, it seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students of Hogwarts?” <PER>Snape</PER> gave a stiff nod.
“Thank you, Severus ” The office disappeared, and now <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.
“Not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind means to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could <PER>Harry</PER> have the strength to do what must be done?” “But what must <PER>Harry</PER> do?” “That is between <PER>Harry</PER> and me.
“Tell him that on the night Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> tried to kill him, when Lily cast Lily's own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and a fragment of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building.
“You have kept <PER>Snape</PER> alive so that <PER>Snape</PER> can die at the right moment?” “Don’t be shocked, Severus.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> watched <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fly away, and as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s silvery glow faded <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned back to <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes were full of tears.
Now, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Snape</PER> talking to the portrait of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> behind <PER>Snape</PER>'s desk.
“You will have to give <PER>Voldemort</PER> the correct date of <PER>Harry</PER>’s departure from <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt and uncle’s,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> was flying alongside <PER>Snape</PER> on a broomstick through a clear dark night: <PER>Harry</PER> was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a <PER>Harry</PER> who was really George.
A Death Eater moved ahead of <PER>Snape</PER> and raised A Death Eater's wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back — “ Sectumsemprcd” shouted <PER>Snape</PER>.
Tears were dripping from the end of <PER>Snape</PER>'s hooked nose as <PER>Snape</PER> read the old letter from Lily.
Lots of love, Lily <PER>Snape</PER> took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and Lily <PER>Snape</PER>'s love, and tucked it inside his robes.
He approached the portrait of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and pulled at the portrait of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> side.
“And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to give Potter the sword?” said <PER>Snape</PER> as <PER>Snape</PER> swung a traveling cloak over <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later <PER>Harry</PER> lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room: <PER>Snape</PER> might just have closed the door.
Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought his was learning the secrets of victory, <PER>Harry</PER> understood at last that <PER>Harry</PER> was not supposed to survive.
Along the way, he was to dispose of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend <PER>Voldemort</PER>, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither could survive.
Of course there had been a bigger plan; <PER>Harry</PER> had simply been too foolish to see it, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that now.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never questioned <PER>Harry</PER>'s own assumption that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted <PER>Harry</PER> alive.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER>'s life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had passed the job of destroying them to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and obediently <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only <PER>Voldemort</PER>, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to life!
And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had known that <PER>Harry</PER> would not duck out, that <PER>Harry</PER> would keep going to the end, even though it was <PER>Harry</PER>'s end, because <PER>Harry</PER> had taken trouble to get to know <PER>Harry</PER>, hadn’t <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew, as <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew, that <PER>Harry</PER> would not let anyone else die for him now that him had discovered it was in his power to stop it.
But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had overestimated <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
One Horcrux remained to bind <PER>Voldemort</PER> to the earth, even after <PER>Harry</PER> had been killed.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> would know what needed to be done, of course.
That would have been why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to confide in two others so that if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> fulfilled <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s true destiny a little early, they could carry on.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed a long way away, in a far- off country; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> felt as though <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had parted from them long ago.
Nearly half of the hour allotted by <PER>Voldemort</PER> for <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s surrender had elapsed.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Invisibility Cloak over <PER>Harry</PER> and descended through the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
Perhaps some tiny part of <PER>Harry</PER> hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Invisibility Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and <PER>Harry</PER> reached the front doors easily.
Then <PER>Neville</PER> nearly walked into <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced down and felt another dull blow to <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle had done.
<PER>Neville</PER> leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped <PER>Neville</PER>'s forehead with the back of <PER>Neville</PER>'s hand.
People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not see any of the people <PER>Harry</PER> loved, no hint of <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> would have given all the time remaining to <PER>Harry</PER> for just one last look at them; but then, would <PER>Harry</PER> ever have the strength to stop looking?
<PER>Harry</PER> moved toward <PER>Neville</PER>, who was bending over another body.
“<PER>Neville</PER>.” “Blimey, <PER>Harry</PER>, you nearly gave me heart failure!” <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to <PER>Harry</PER> out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re not thinking of handing yourself over?” “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied easily.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now <PER>Neville</PER> would take <PER>Harry</PER>’s place: There would still be three in the secret.
<PER>Neville</PER> patted <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder, released <PER>Harry</PER>, and walked away to look for more bodies.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung the Cloak back over <PER>Harry</PER> and walked on.
“I don’t want to fight anymore!” “I know,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>'s voice broke.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to shout out to the night, <PER>Harry</PER> wanted <PER>Ginny</PER> to know that <PER>Harry</PER> was there, <PER>Harry</PER> wanted <PER>Ginny</PER>'s to know where <PER>Harry</PER> was going.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>, the abandoned boys, had all found home here.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding <PER>Ginny</PER>'s hand.
With a huge effort <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> on.
He thought He saw <PER>Ginny</PER> look around as He passed, and wondered whether <PER>Ginny</PER> had sensed someone walking nearby, but He did not speak, and He did not look back.
All those visits to <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and <PER>Ron</PER> vomiting slugs, and <PER>Hermione</PER> helping him save Norbert him moved on, and now him reached the edge of the forest, and him stopped.
Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER> in life.
“Invisible to anyone else.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother.
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, but sure that <PER>Voldemort</PER> would find <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
The dead who walked beside his through the forest were much more real to his now than the living back at the castle: <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as his stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed them, knowing that them would lead <PER>Harry</PER> exactly where <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to go.
They had traveled on mere minutes when <PER>Harry</PER> saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that <PER>Harry</PER> knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing <PER>Harry</PER>'s long nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at the great blond Rowle's bleeding lip.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> raised <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s hand to silence She, and She did not speak another word, but eyed <PER>Voldemort</PER> in worshipful fascination.
“I thought he would come,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s high, clear voice, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s eyes on the leaping flames.
“You weren’t.” <PER>Harry</PER> said it as loudly as <PER>Harry</PER> could, with all the force <PER>Harry</PER> could muster: <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to sound afraid.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had frozen where <PER>Voldemort</PER> stood, but <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s red eyes had found <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> stared as <PER>Harry</PER> moved toward <PER>Harry</PER>, with nothing but the fire between them.
Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from <PER>Voldemort</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>, her breast heaving.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand against <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest, but <PER>Harry</PER> made no attempt to draw it.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if <PER>Harry</PER> managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first.
And still, <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each other, and now <PER>Voldemort</PER> tilted his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and <PER>Harry</PER> thought inexplicably of <PER>Ginny</PER>, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his — <PER>Voldemort</PER> had raised — <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while <PER>Harry</PER> could still stand, before <PER>Harry</PER> lost control, before <PER>Harry</PER> betrayed fear — <PER>Harry</PER> saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone.
Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, <PER>Harry</PER> became conscious that <PER>Harry</PER> was naked.
Convinced as <PER>Harry</PER> was of <PER>Harry</PER>'s total solitude, this did not concern <PER>Harry</PER>, but this did intrigue <PER>Harry</PER> slightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether, as <PER>Harry</PER> could feel, <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to see.
In opening them, <PER>Harry</PER> discovered that <PER>Harry</PER> had eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist <PER>Harry</PER> had ever experienced before.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned slowly on the spot, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s surroundings seemed to invent themselves before <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was walking toward Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue.
“<PER>Harry</PER>.” Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spread Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s arms wide, and Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hands were both whole and white and undamaged.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat down in one of them, and <PER>Harry</PER> fell into the other, staring at <PER>Harry</PER>'s old headmaster’s face.
“Go on!” “So the part of his soul that was in me ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nodded still more enthusiastically, urging <PER>Harry</PER> onward, a broad smile of encouragement on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face. "
“But if <PER>Voldemort</PER> used the Killing Curse,” <PER>Harry</PER> started again, “and nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?” “I think you know,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Are you sure we can’t do anything?” “There is no help possible.” “Then explain more,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled.
“What you must understand, <PER>Harry</PER>, is that you and Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested.
“He killed me with your wand.” “He failed to kill you with your wand,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> corrected <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course,” he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.” “I feel great at the moment, though,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s clean, unblemished hands.
“Where would you say that we are?” Until <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had asked, <PER>Harry</PER> had not known.
Now, however, <PER>Harry</PER> found that <PER>Harry</PER> had an answer ready to give.
“Well?” For the first time since <PER>Harry</PER> had met <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, he looked less than an old man, much less.
“Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Not the way he did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
After all <PER>Harry</PER>'s anger at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend <PER>Dumbledore</PER> from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> closed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes for a moment and nodded.
“True.” <PER>Harry</PER> waited, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not speak, so <PER>Dumbledore</PER> prompted <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached out and was glad to find that <PER>Harry</PER> could touch <PER>Harry</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm tightly and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gradually regained control.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not ask whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had ever found out who struck Ariana dead.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to know, and even less did <PER>Harry</PER> want <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to have to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
At last <PER>Harry</PER> knew what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would have seen when <PER>Harry</PER> looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over <PER>Harry</PER>.
At last <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Grindelwald tried to stop <PER>Voldemort</PER> going after the wand.
“They say <PER>Voldemort</PER> showed remorse in later years, alone in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s cell at Nurmengard.
After another short pause <PER>Harry</PER> said, “You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nodded.
“That bit didn’t work out.” The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat without talking for the longest time yet.
“I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?” “That is up to you.” “I’ve got a choice?” “Oh yes.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not dare open <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, but allowed <PER>Harry</PER>'s other senses to explore <PER>Harry</PER>'s predicament.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand was still stowed beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes because <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s pressed between <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest and the ground.
Desperate to see what was happening and why, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes by a millimeter.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> seemed to be getting to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes again and considered what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen.
“My Lord, let me — ” “I do not require assistance,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> coldly, and though <PER>Voldemort</PER> could not see it, <PER>Harry</PER> pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand.
Nobody approached <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press <PER>Harry</PER> harder into the ground, and <PER>Harry</PER> was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch.
him could only lie there, with him's heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though it was, that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was wary of approaching him, that <PER>Voldemort</PER> suspected that all had not gone to plan.
Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s shirt, down to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest, and felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s arms trembling with the force of <PER>Harry</PER>'s heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as <PER>Hagrid</PER> cradled <PER>Harry</PER> in his arms, and <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to <PER>Hagrid</PER> that all was not, yet, lost.
“Move,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> stumbled forward, forcing <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest.
Branches caught at <PER>Harry</PER>’s hair and robes, but <PER>Harry</PER> lay quiescent, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth lolling open, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while <PER>Hagrid</PER> sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter .
The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while <PER>Harry</PER> could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through <PER>Harry</PER>'s closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s unexpected bellow nearly forced <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes open.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered how many centaurs were watching how many centaurs's procession pass; <PER>Harry</PER> dared not open <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes to look.
“Stop.” <PER>Harry</PER> thought that <PER>Hagrid</PER> must have been forced to obey <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s command, because he lurched a little.
The fact of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own survival burned inside <PER>Harry</PER>, a talisman against them, as though his father’s stag kept guardian in his heart.
Someone passed close by <PER>Harry</PER>, and Someone knew that it was <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself because Someone spoke a moment later, Someone's voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the grounds, crashing upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s eardrums.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was so close to <PER>Voldemort</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare open <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes again.
“Come,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> move ahead, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> was forced to follow.
Now <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes a fraction, and saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> striding in front of them, wearing the great snake Nagini around <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage.
But <PER>Harry</PER> had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” sobbed <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> ” <PER>Harry</PER> shut his eyes tight again.
<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> ” <PER>Harry</PER> knew that they were approaching the castle and strained <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see, even through <PER>Harry</PER>'s closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon <PER>Harry</PER> from the entrance hall.
he saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> standing a little in front of <PER>Voldemort</PER>, stroking Nagini’s head with a single white finger.
“You see?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Voldemort</PER> striding backward and forward right beside the place where <PER>Voldemort</PER> lay.
“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and there was relish in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s voice for the lie, “killed while trying to save himself — ” But <PER>Voldemort</PER> broke off: <PER>Harry</PER> heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; <PER>Voldemort</PER> opened <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s eyes an infinitesimal amount.
Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at <PER>Voldemort</PER>: <PER>Harry</PER> saw the figure hit the ground, Disarmed, <PER>Voldemort</PER> throwing the challenger’s wand aside and laughing.
“But you are a pureblood, aren’t you, my brave boy?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> asked <PER>Neville</PER>, who stood facing <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s empty hands curled in fists.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold.
“Very well,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard more danger in the silkiness of <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice than in the most powerful curse.
“<PER>Neville</PER> here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and with a flick of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand, wand caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames.
Screams split the dawn, and <PER>Neville</PER> was aflame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not bear it: <PER>Harry</PER> must act — And then many things happened at the same moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, swung the Invisibility Cloak over <PER>Harry</PER>, and sprang to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, as <PER>Neville</PER> moved too.
In one swift, fluid motion, <PER>Neville</PER> broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon <PER>Neville</PER>; the flaming hat fell off <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle — The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye.
With a single stroke <PER>Neville</PER> sliced off the great snake’s head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet — Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, <PER>Harry</PER> cast a Shield Charm between <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> before the latter could raise his wand.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was in the center of the battle, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was striking and smiting all within reach.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not get a clear shot, but fought <PER>Harry</PER>'s way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced everyone who could walk's way inside.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by <PER>Hagrid</PER>, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa <PER>Malfoy</PER> running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was now dueling <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Slughorn, and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him — Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and like her master she dueled three at once: <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to their, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to <PER>Ginny</PER> that she missed death by an inch — He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than <PER>Voldemort</PER>, but before He had gone a few steps He was knocked sideways.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> turned in slow motion; <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s fury at the fall of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> raised <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand and directed it at Molly Weasley.
“Protego\” roared <PER>Harry</PER>, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> stared around for the source as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last.
The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as <PER>Voldemort</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other.
“I don’t want anyone else to try to help,” <PER>Harry</PER> said loudly, and in the total silence <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice carried like a trumpet call.
“You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was pulling the strings?” “Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
They were still moving sideways, both of They, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for <PER>Harry</PER> no face existed but <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s.
“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, “you must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?” “I believe both,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw shock flit across the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; <PER>Voldemort</PER> began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s screams; humorless and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall.
“Than I, than Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, who has performed magic that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> himself never dreamed of?” “Oh, himself dreamed of it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but himself knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.” “You mean himself was weak!” screamed <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been himself, what will be mine!” “No, himself was cleverer than you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “a better wizard, a better man.” “I brought about the death of Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “You thought you did,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but you were wrong.” For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> is dead\” <PER>Voldemort</PER> hurled the words at <PER>Harry</PER> as though they would cause <PER>Harry</PER> unendurable pain.
“His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and His will not return!” “Yes, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s dead,” said <PER>Harry</PER> calmly, “but you didn’t have <PER>Harry</PER> killed.
“Severus <PER>Snape</PER> wasn’t yours,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Severus <PER>Snape</PER> was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother.
“<PER>Snape</PER>’s Patronus was a doe,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “the same as my mother’s, because he loved my mother's for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children.
“It matters not whether <PER>Snape</PER> was mine or <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path!
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes whiten.
“Yes, I dare,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all.
“The true master of the Elder Wand was <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.” Blank shock showed in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s face for a moment, but then it was gone.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the high voice shriek as <PER>Harry</PER> too yelled <PER>Harry</PER>'s best hope to the heavens, pointing <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand: “Avada KedavraV’ “ Expelliarmus\ ” The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s green jet meet <PER>Harry</PER>'s own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last.
And <PER>Harry</PER>, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in <PER>Harry</PER>'s free hand as <PER>Voldemort</PER> fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> was dead, killed by <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own rebounding curse, and <PER>Harry</PER> stood with two wands in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, staring down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s enemy’s shell.
The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him.
Then <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and Kingsley and <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Flitwick and Sprout, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of hundreds of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last — The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light.
They moved <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s body and laid <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s body in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him.
After a while, exhausted and drained, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> sitting on a bench beside Luna.
Everyone who heard looked around, and <PER>Harry</PER> slid the Cloak up over <PER>Harry</PER>, and got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> spotted <PER>Ginny</PER> two tables away; <PER>Ginny</PER> was sitting with <PER>Ginny</PER>'s head on <PER>Ginny</PER>'s mother’s shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk.
“Will you come with me?” They stood up at once, and together he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the Great Hall.
“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pushing open a door to let <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> through.
But first he owed an explanation to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth.
<PER>Harry</PER> had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where <PER>Harry</PER> had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made <PER>Harry</PER> cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of <PER>Voldemort</PER> But it was applause.
At last, <PER>Harry</PER> held up <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping the portraits's eyes and waiting eagerly for <PER>Harry</PER> to speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> directed <PER>Harry</PER>'s words at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, however, and chose them with enormous care.
“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> beamed.
“But of course, <PER>Harry</PER>, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!” “And then there’s this.” <PER>Harry</PER> held up the Elder Wand, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, <PER>Harry</PER> did not like to see.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> had succeeded.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion.
“I think <PER>Harry</PER>’s right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
“And quite honestly,” <PER>Harry</PER> turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for <PER>Harry</PER> in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring <PER>Harry</PER> a sandwich there, “I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.” ayue Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year.
Albus’s voice drifted back to <PER>Harry</PER> over the surrounding clamor; <PER>Harry</PER>'s sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello.
A group of four people faces only came into focus when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.
“Parked all right, then?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but no pressure.” “<PER>Ron</PER>\” Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.
“He doesn’t mean it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was no longer paying attention.
Catching <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye, Catching <PER>Harry</PER>’s nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away.
“Look who it is.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing there with <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s throat.
The new boy resembled <PER>Malfoy</PER> as much as Albus resembled <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.
“I don’t mind sharing with A1 — Teddy could have my room!” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, “you and A1 will share a room only when I want the house demolished.” <PER>Harry</PER> checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett’s.
“It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.” “Don’t forget to give <PER>Neville</PER> our love!” <PER>Ginny</PER> told James as she hugged him.
“See you at Christmas.” “Bye, Al,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER>'s son hugged him.
<PER>Harry</PER> crouched down so that Albus ’s face was slightly above <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
“Albus Severus,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quietly, so that nobody but <PER>Ginny</PER> could hear, and <PER>Ginny</PER> was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts.
The train began to move, and <PER>Harry</PER> walked alongside it, watching <PER>Harry</PER>'s son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching <PER>Harry</PER>'s son glide away from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’ll be all right,” murmured <PER>Ginny</PER>.
As <PER>Harry</PER> looked at her, <PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
