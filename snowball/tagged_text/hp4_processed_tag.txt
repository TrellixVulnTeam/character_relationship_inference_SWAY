The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the <PER>Riddle</PER> House,” even though it had been many years since the <PER>Riddle</PER> family had lived there.
Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer’s morning, when the <PER>Riddle</PER> House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three <PER>Riddle</PER>s dead.
Elderly Mister and Mistress <PER>Riddle</PER> had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and Elderly Mister and Mistress <PER>Riddle</PER>'s grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse.
The wealthy man who owned the <PER>Riddle</PER> House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; The wealthy man who owned the <PER>Riddle</PER> House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use said in the village that he kept it for “tax reasons,” though nobody was very clear what these might be.
Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, him looked up at the <PER>Riddle</PER> House and saw lights glimmering in the <PER>Riddle</PER> House upper windows.
“It could be done without <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, My Lord.” Another pause, more protracted, and then — “Without <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” breathed the second voice softly.
my faithful servant at Hogwarts <PER>Harry</PER> Potter started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; my faithful servant at Hogwarts <PER>Harry</PER> Potter was hissing and spitting without drawing breath.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, breathing hard as though <PER>Harry</PER> had been running.
<PER>Harry</PER> had awoken from a vivid dream with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands pressed over <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers over the scar again.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to recall what <PER>Harry</PER> had been dreaming about before <PER>Harry</PER> had awoken.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach at the very thought.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes tightly and tried to remember what <PER>Voldemort</PER> had looked like, but it was impossible.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that at the moment when <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s chair had swung around, and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, had seen what was sitting in it, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had felt a spasm of horror, which had awoken <PER>Voldemort</PER> or had that been the pain in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar?
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s face into <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, blocking out <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in <PER>Harry</PER>'s cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> tried to hold on to them.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though <PER>Harry</PER> could not remember the name and they had been plotting to kill someone else him).
<PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s face out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, and stared around <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there.
On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; <PER>Harry</PER> had been reading it before <PER>Harry</PER> fell asleep last night.
Even Quidditch — in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion, the best sport in the world — couldn’t distract <PER>Harry</PER> at the moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> placed Flying with the Cannons on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey the street below.
And yet and yet <PER>Harry</PER> went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on the bed, running a finger over <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had lost all the bones from <PER>Harry</PER>'s right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night.
No, the thing that was bothering <PER>Harry</PER> was that the last time <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar had hurt <PER>Harry</PER>, it had been because <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been close by.
<PER>Harry</PER> listened closely to the silence around <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER> mentally; <PER>Harry</PER> was being stupid.
There was no one in the house with <PER>Harry</PER> except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and <PER>Dudley</PER>, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.
Asleep was the way <PER>Harry</PER> liked the Dursleys best; it wasn’t as though they were ever any help to <PER>Harry</PER> awake.
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and <PER>Dudley</PER> were <PER>Harry</PER>’s only living relatives.
They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but They were still apt to blame <PER>Harry</PER> for anything that went wrong about the house.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about <PER>Harry</PER>'s life in the wizarding world.
And yet it was because of <PER>Voldemort</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had come to live with the Dursleys in the first place.
If it hadn’t been for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> would not have had the lightning scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
If it hadn’t been for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> would still have had parents.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been a year old the night that <PER>Voldemort</PER> — the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years — arrived at <PER>Harry</PER>'s house and killed <PER>Harry</PER>'s father and mother.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had then turned <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand on <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Voldemort</PER> had performed the curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s steady rise to power — and, incredibly, it had not worked.
<PER>Harry</PER> had survived with nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been reduced to something barely alive.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> powers gone, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s life almost extinguished, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s followers had disbanded, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter had become famous.
It had been enough of a shock for <PER>Harry</PER> to discover, on <PER>Harry</PER>'s eleventh birthday, that <PER>Harry</PER> was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name.
<PER>Harry</PER> had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed <PER>Harry</PER> wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went.
But <PER>Harry</PER> was used to it now: At the end of this summer, <PER>Harry</PER> would be starting <PER>Harry</PER>'s fourth year at Hogwarts, and <PER>Harry</PER> was already counting the days until <PER>Harry</PER> would be back at the castle again.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked hopelessly around <PER>Harry</PER>'s room again, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye paused on the birthday cards <PER>Harry</PER>'s two best friends had sent <PER>Harry</PER> at the end of July.
What would they say if <PER>Harry</PER> wrote to they and told they about <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar hurting?
<PER>Harry</PER> doubted very much whether a book could help <PER>Harry</PER> now.
As far as <PER>Harry</PER> knew, <PER>Harry</PER> was the only living person to have survived a curse like <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that <PER>Voldemort</PER> would find <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.
As for informing the headmaster, <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> went during the summer holidays.
<PER>Harry</PER> amused <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, picturing <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s long silver beard, full-length wizard’s robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose.
Wherever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was, though, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that Hedwig would be able to find <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER>’s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address.
And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, <PER>Ron</PER> Weasley’s, reaction, and in a moment, <PER>Ron</PER>’s red hair and long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before <PER>Harry</PER>, wearing a bemused expression.
In any case, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, was getting jumpy about a few moments’ pain.
Mistress Weasley would fuss worse than <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Fred and George, <PER>Ron</PER>’s sixteen-year-old twin brothers, might think <PER>Harry</PER> was losing his nerve.
The Weasleys were <PER>Harry</PER>’s favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite he to stay any time now (<PER>Ron</PER> had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn’t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.
<PER>Harry</PER> kneaded <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead with <PER>Harry</PER>'s knuckles.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk; <PER>Harry</PER> pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded <PER>Harry</PER>'s eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase <PER>Harry</PER>'s problem, still marveling at the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t thought of Dear Sirius straight away.
But then, perhaps it wasn’t so surprising — after all, <PER>Harry</PER> had only found out that Dear Sirius was <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather two months ago.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> knew otherwise, however; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had believed their story.
For one glorious hour, <PER>Harry</PER> had believed that <PER>Harry</PER> was leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered <PER>Harry</PER> a home once <PER>Harry</PER>'s name had been cleared.
But the chance had been snatched away from <PER>Harry</PER> — Wormtail had escaped before they could take <PER>Harry</PER> to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> had helped <PER>Harry</PER> escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run.
Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to <PER>Harry</PER>, even if <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t be with <PER>Harry</PER>.
It was due to Sirius that <PER>Harry</PER> now had all <PER>Harry</PER>'s school things in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom with <PER>Harry</PER>.
The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of keeping <PER>Harry</PER> as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of <PER>Harry</PER>'s powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this.
But them's attitude had changed since them had found out that <PER>Harry</PER> had a dangerous murderer for a godfather — for <PER>Harry</PER> had conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.
<PER>Harry</PER> had received two letters from Sirius since <PER>Harry</PER> had been back at Privet Drive.
<PER>Harry</PER>, on the other hand, had liked them; them put <PER>Harry</PER> in mind of palm trees and white sand, and <PER>Harry</PER> hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), <PER>Harry</PER> was enjoying <PER>Harry</PER>.
Sirius’s letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed, sounded cheerful, and in both of them <PER>Harry</PER> had reminded <PER>Harry</PER> to call on <PER>Harry</PER> if ever <PER>Harry</PER> needed to.
Finally, when the sun had risen, when <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia’s room, <PER>Harry</PER> cleared <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread <PER>Harry</PER>'s finished letter.
<PER>Harry</PER> Yes, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, that looked all right.
There was no point putting in the dream; <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want it to look as though <PER>Harry</PER> was too worried.
<PER>Harry</PER> folded up the parchment and laid the parchment aside on <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk, ready for when Hedwig returned.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, stretched, and opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s wardrobe once more.
When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto <PER>Dudley</PER>’s plate with a tremulous “There you are, Diddy darling,” <PER>Dudley</PER> glowered at her.
The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all <PER>Dudley</PER>’s favorite things — fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers — and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called “rabbit food.” To make <PER>Dudley</PER> feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that it was a lot smaller than <PER>Dudley</PER>’s.
Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to keep up <PER>Dudley</PER>’s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than <PER>Harry</PER>.
The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, <PER>Harry</PER> had sent Hedwig to <PER>Harry</PER>'s friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to the occasion magnificently.
(<PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t touched these; <PER>Harry</PER> had had too much experience of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cooking.)
And then on <PER>Harry</PER>’s birthday (which the Dursleys had completely ignored) <PER>Harry</PER> had received four superb birthday cakes, one each from <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and Sirius.
<PER>Harry</PER> still had two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when <PER>Harry</PER> got back upstairs, <PER>Harry</PER> ate <PER>Harry</PER>'s grapefruit without complaint.
Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at <PER>Dudley</PER>, who had already finished him's own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing <PER>Harry</PER>’s with a very sour look in him's piggy little eyes.
“So,” he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face <PER>Harry</PER> as though he were about to pronounce <PER>Harry</PER> under arrest.
“So.” <PER>Harry</PER> would have dearly loved to have said, “So what?” but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel that Uncle Vernon’s temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food.
Uncle Vernon glared at <PER>Harry</PER>, then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud: Dear Mister and Petunia, We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great deal from <PER>Harry</PER> about my son <PER>Ron</PER>.
We would of course be glad to have <PER>Harry</PER> stay for the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see <PER>Harry</PER> safely onto the train back to school.
It would be best for <PER>Harry</PER> to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and I am not sure <PER>Harry</PER> even knows where it is.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was going on behind the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon’s most fundamental instincts came into conflict.
Allowing <PER>Harry</PER> to go would make <PER>Harry</PER> happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled against for thirteen years.
On the other hand, allowing <PER>Harry</PER> to disappear to the Weasleys’ for the rest of the summer would get rid of <PER>Harry</PER> two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having <PER>Harry</PER> in the house.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone “dumpy,” when his own son, <PER>Dudley</PER>, had finally achieved what his’d been threatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than his’d was tall.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw, with some satisfaction, that <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle looked vaguely panicky.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips form the words “send us your answer in the normal way.” He scowled.
“Normal for us,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and before <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle could stop <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> added, “you know, owl post.
“How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face now a rich plum color.
“You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back — ” “Only after <PER>Dudley</PER> finished with them,” said <PER>Harry</PER> coldly, and indeed, <PER>Harry</PER> was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, and which fell past the knees of <PER>Harry</PER>'s extremely baggy jeans.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t following <PER>Dudley</PER>’s diet, and <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t going to let Uncle Vernon stop <PER>Harry</PER> from going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if <PER>Harry</PER> could help it.
“You’re — you’re writing to him, are you?” said Uncle Vernon, in a would-be calm voice — but <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the pupils of <PER>Harry</PER>'s tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.
If he tried to stop <PER>Harry</PER> writing to Sirius, Sirius would think <PER>Harry</PER> was being mistreated.
If <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> he told <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t go to the Quidditch World Cup, <PER>Harry</PER> would write and tell Sirius, who would know <PER>Harry</PER> was being mistreated.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see the conclusion forming in <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle’s mind as though the great mustached face were transparent.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried not to smile, to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s own face as blank as possible.
Outside in the hall He nearly ran into <PER>Dudley</PER>, who had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear <PER>Harry</PER> being told off.
“I feel really full, don’t you?” Laughing at the astonished look on <PER>Dudley</PER>’s face, <PER>Harry</PER> took the stairs three at a time, and hurled <PER>Harry</PER> back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom.
“OUCH!” said <PER>Harry</PER> as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> massaged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit <PER>Harry</PER>, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework.
<PER>Harry</PER> then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent down, recognized <PER>Ron</PER>’s handwriting, then tore open the envelope.
Maybe <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t read <PER>Ron</PER>’s writing.
See you soon — <PER>Ron</PER> “Calm down!” <PER>Harry</PER> said as the small owl flew low over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, twittering madly with what <PER>Harry</PER> could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s eagle-feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh piece of parchment, and wrote: <PER>Ron</PER>, it’s all okay, the Muggles say I can come.
“I’ll be at <PER>Ron</PER>’s when you get back, all right?” <PER>Harry</PER> told her.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched her out of sight, then crawled under <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, wrenched up the loose floorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat there on the floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was flooding through <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had cake, and <PER>Dudley</PER> had nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summer’s day, <PER>Harry</PER> would be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar felt perfectly normal again, and <PER>Harry</PER> was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup.
By twelve o’clock the next day, <PER>Harry</PER>’s school trunk was packed with <PER>Harry</PER>'s school things and all <PER>Harry</PER>'s most prized possessions — the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t bothered about what the neighbors would think, but <PER>Harry</PER> was anxious about how rude the Dursleys might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent most of the afternoon in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom; <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros.
Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but Uncle Vernon's tiny eyes were not moving, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> was really listening with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might for the sound of an approaching car.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t take the tension; <PER>Harry</PER> left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch and <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.
“Maybe — er — the traffic’s bad, or something.” Ten past five then a quarter past five <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to feel anxious Ten past five then a quarter past five <PER>Harry</PER> now.
he and George knew where <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedroom was, having once rescued <PER>Harry</PER>’s from <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedroom in the dead of night.
<PER>Harry</PER> suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of <PER>Dudley</PER>; they had heard a lot about him from <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear the clunk of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared <PER>Dudley</PER> out of the kitchen.
“Yep,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “that’s <PER>Dudley</PER>.” He and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming.
Indeed, from the tone of Arthur's voice when Arthur next spoke, <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure that Arthur thought <PER>Dudley</PER> was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought <PER>Harry</PER> was, except that Arthur felt sympathy rather than fear.
“Having a good holiday, <PER>Dudley</PER>?” <PER>Dudley</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands tighten still harder over <PER>Harry</PER>'s massive backside.
“Right then, George,” said Arthur, “you and the trunk.” <PER>Harry</PER> helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn the trunk onto the trunk end so that <PER>Harry</PER> could hold it better.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved toward the fire, but just as <PER>Harry</PER> reached the edge of the hearth, Arthur put out a hand and held Arthur back.
“<PER>Harry</PER> said good-bye to you,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
<PER>Dudley</PER> was no longer standing behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents.
One bewildered second later, <PER>Harry</PER> realized that the foot-long thing was <PER>Dudley</PER>’s tongue — and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before <PER>Harry</PER>.
Aunt Petunia hurled Aunt Petunia onto the ground beside <PER>Dudley</PER>, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, <PER>Dudley</PER> yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight Aunt Petunia's off.
“Not to worry, I can sort him out!” him yelled, advancing on <PER>Dudley</PER> with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw Aunt Petunia on top of <PER>Dudley</PER>, shielding him from Mister Weasley.
“It’s a simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it’s only an Engorgement Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct it — ” But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic-stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging <PER>Dudley</PER>’s tongue as though determined to rip it out; <PER>Dudley</PER> appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mister Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.
“I’ll sort this out!” <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon’s second ornament narrowly missed <PER>Harry</PER>'s left ear, and on balance <PER>Harry</PER> thought it best to leave the situation to Arthur.
Arthur stepped into the fire, looking over Arthur's shoulder as Arthur said “the Burrow!” Arthur last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Arthur blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon’s hand with Arthur's wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of <PER>Dudley</PER>, and <PER>Dudley</PER>’s tongue lolling around like a great slimy python.
<PER>Harry</PER> spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past <PER>Harry</PER>, until <PER>Harry</PER> started to feel sick and closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
Then, when at last <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> slowing down, <PER>Harry</PER> threw out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and came to a halt in time to prevent <PER>Harry</PER> from falling face forward out of the Weasleys’ kitchen fire.
“Did <PER>Harry</PER> eat it?” said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“How’re you doing, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said the nearer of the two, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> and holding out a large hand, which <PER>Harry</PER> shook, feeling calluses and blisters under <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; <PER>Harry</PER> had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around.
“Isn’t he, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yeah, he is, Arthur,” said <PER>Harry</PER> earnestly.
“Oh hello, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear,” she said, spotting <PER>Harry</PER> and smiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that, however angry <PER>Harry</PER> was with Fred and George, <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t really intended to tell Molly what had happened.
One, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s friend, <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
The other, who was small and red-haired, was <PER>Ron</PER>’s younger sister, <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Both of them smiled at <PER>Harry</PER>, who grinned back, which made <PER>Ginny</PER> go scarlet — she had been very taken with <PER>Harry</PER> ever since <PER>Harry</PER>'s first visit to the Burrow.
“If it’s got anything to do with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes — ” “Why don’t you show <PER>Harry</PER> where he’s sleeping, <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> from the doorway.
“He knows where He’s sleeping,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “in my room, He slept there last — ” “We can all go,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> pointedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> edged out of the kitchen, and they, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> both laughed, although <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t.
“You might sneer, <PER>Ron</PER>,” Percy said heatedly, “but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow- bottomed products that seriously endanger — ” “Yeah, yeah, all right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and he started off upstairs again.
As <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> followed <PER>Ron</PER> up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them.
The room at the top of the house where <PER>Ron</PER> slept looked much as it had the last time that <PER>Harry</PER> had come to stay: the same posters of <PER>Ron</PER>’s favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered <PER>Ron</PER>’s letter to <PER>Harry</PER> in Privet Drive.
“Percy gets to keep Percy's room all to Percy because Percy’s got to work.” “Er — why are you calling that owl Pig?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> named him,” he explained to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> too well to take him seriously.
<PER>Harry</PER> had moaned continually about <PER>Harry</PER>'s old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when <PER>Hermione</PER>’s cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Where’s Crookshanks?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> now.
“They saved my life, those cakes.” “And have you heard from — ?” <PER>Ron</PER> began, but at a look from <PER>Hermione</PER> he fell silent.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> had been about to ask about Sirius.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about <PER>Harry</PER>’s godfather as <PER>Harry</PER> was.
Nobody but themselves and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s innocence.
“I think they’ve stopped arguing,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, to cover the awkward moment, because <PER>Ginny</PER> was looking curiously from <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan.
“C’mon,” <PER>Ron</PER> said hurriedly to <PER>Harry</PER>, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, “let’s go and help Bill and Charlie.” They left Molly and headed out the back door into the yard.
Fred and George were cheering, <PER>Ginny</PER> was laughing, and <PER>Hermione</PER> was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.
By seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Molly’s excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were settling <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> down to eat beneath a clear, deep- blue sky.
To somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, <PER>Harry</PER> listened rather than talked as <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.
“The top- secret one.” <PER>Ron</PER> rolled his eyes and muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, “He’s been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since He started work.
Flying came more naturally to <PER>Harry</PER> than anything else in the magical world, and <PER>Harry</PER> played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.
<PER>Harry</PER> was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as <PER>Harry</PER> watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then <PER>Harry</PER> said very quietly to <PER>Harry</PER>, “So — have you heard from Sirius lately?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked around, listening closely.
“We sent it.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> had barely lain down to sleep in <PER>Ron</PER>’s room when <PER>Harry</PER> was being shaken awake by Molly.
“Time to go, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear,” she whispered, moving away to wake <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt around for <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses, put them on, and sat up.
At the foot of <PER>Harry</PER>’s mattress <PER>Harry</PER> saw two large, disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets.
“We’re supposed to go incognito — do I look like a Muggle, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, smiling, “very good.” “Where ’re Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?” said George, failing to stifle a huge yawn.
“Percy’s been Apparating downstairs every morning since, just to prove Percy can.” There were footsteps down the passageway and <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> came into the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy.
“Why do we have to be up so early?” <PER>Ginny</PER> said, rubbing early?” <PER>Ginny</PER>'s eyes and sitting down at the table.
“I’ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along around midday,Molly said to Arthur, as he, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> set off across the dark yard after Fred and George.
Each breath <PER>Harry</PER> took was sharp in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest and Each breath <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs were starting to seize up when, at last, Each breath <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet found level ground.
“This is <PER>Hermione</PER>, friend of <PER>Ron</PER>’s — and <PER>Harry</PER>, another friend — ” “Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening.
<PER>Harry</PER> was used to people looking curiously at <PER>Harry</PER> when they met <PER>Harry</PER>, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made <PER>Harry</PER> feel uncomfortable.
“<PER>Harry</PER> fell off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom, Dad,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered.
“Three ” muttered Arthur, one eye still on his watch, “two one ” It happened immediately: <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though a hook just behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> feet left the ground; <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>, their shoulders banging into his; their were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then — him feet slammed into the ground; <PER>Ron</PER> staggered into him and him fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near him's head with a heavy thud.
<PER>Harry</PER> disentangled himself from <PER>Ron</PER> and got to his feet.
When <PER>Harry</PER> heard their footsteps, <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to look at their.
Arthur retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned <PER>Harry</PER> toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized the symptoms of one who had just had <PER>Harry</PER>'s memory modified.
<PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have spotted this problem too; <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a quizzical look as Arthur dropped to Arthur's hands and knees and entered the first tent.
“It’s on the other side of the field.” “Well, why don’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> go and get us some water then” — Arthur handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans — “and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire?” “But we’ve got an oven,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> he muttered distractedly, “In broad daylight!
<PER>Harry</PER> caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t understand a word, the tone of every single voice was excited.
When they had assured her that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off again, though, as <PER>Ron</PER> said, “Like we’d say anything else surrounded by that lot.” “I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over the Bulgarians's tents?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument.
“I like a healthy breeze ’round my privates, thanks.” <PER>Hermione</PER> was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that <PER>Hermione</PER> had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away.
Oliver Wood, the old captain of <PER>Harry</PER>’s House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged <PER>Harry</PER> over to <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ tent to introduce <PER>Harry</PER>, and told <PER>Harry</PER> excitedly that <PER>Harry</PER> had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team.
More to stop <PER>Ron</PER> from smirking than anything, <PER>Harry</PER> hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen before.
Mister Weasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s benefit; Mister Weasley's own children knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly interested.
his nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray Bludger, <PER>Harry</PER> thought), but <PER>Harry</PER>'s round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy complexion made <PER>Harry</PER> look like a very overgrown schoolboy.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see at once why Percy idolized <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> as they and <PER>Hermione</PER> strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs.
“You won’t be getting anything for Christmas,” <PER>Harry</PER> told him, thrusting Omnioculars into him's and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s hands.
“Oooh, thanks, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.
Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris, Hogsmeade <PER>Harry</PER> tore Hogsmeade <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes away from the sign and looked over Hogsmeade <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them.
<PER>Harry</PER> had set Dobby free from <PER>Harry</PER>'s old owners, the <PER>Malfoy</PER> family.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> spun around in their seats to look.
Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from <PER>Harry</PER>, they had never actually met <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You is surely <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” “Yeah, I am,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium.
Highly embarrassed, Percy repaired them with Percy's wand and thereafter remained in Percy's seat, throwing jealous looks at <PER>Harry</PER>, whom <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge had greeted like an old friend.
They had met before, and Fudge shook <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how <PER>Harry</PER> was, and introduced <PER>Harry</PER> to the wizards on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter oh come on now, you know who he is the boy who survived <PER>Voldemort</PER> you do know who he is — ” The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.
Edging along the second row to three still-empty seats right behind Arthur were none other than Dobby the house-elf’s former owners: Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>; his son, <PER>Malfoy</PER>; and a woman <PER>Harry</PER> supposed must be <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s mother.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been enemies ever since <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s very first journey to Hogwarts.
A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, <PER>Malfoy</PER> greatly resembled <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s father.
“Ah, Fudge,” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, holding out Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hand as Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> reached the Minister of Magic.
Arthur and Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked at each other and <PER>Harry</PER> vividly recalled the last time Arthur and Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> had come face-to-face: It had been in Flourish and Blotts’ bookshop, and they had had a fight.
Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s eyes had returned to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew exactly what was making Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s lip curl like that.
The <PER>Malfoy</PER>s prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, themselves considered anyone of Muggle descent, like <PER>Hermione</PER>, second-class.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> shot <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> one contemptuous look, then settled himself between himself's mother and father.
“Slimy gits,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered as he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned to face the field again.
“Veelal” “What are veel — ?” But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s question was answered for <PER>Harry</PER>.
This puzzled <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment while <PER>Harry</PER> tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon- bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind but then the music started, and <PER>Harry</PER> stopped worrying about them not being human — in fact, <PER>Harry</PER> stopped worrying about anything at all.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, what are you doing?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice from a long way off.
<PER>Harry</PER> was standing up, and one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs was resting on the wall of the box.
Next to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> was frozen in an attitude that looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> were about to dive from a springboard.
<PER>Harry</PER> was with them; <PER>Harry</PER> would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered vaguely why <PER>Harry</PER> had a large green shamrock pinned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Hermione</PER> reached up and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
“There you go,” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, “for the Omnioculars!
<PER>Harry</PER> quickly focused <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
<PER>Harry</PER> spun the speed dial on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted Mostafa's broomstick and kicked a large wooden crate open — four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (<PER>Harry</PER> saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch.
<PER>Harry</PER> spun the slow dial on the right of <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and <PER>Harry</PER> was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against <PER>Harry</PER>'s eardrums.
Hawkshead Attacking Formation, <PER>Harry</PER> read as <PER>Harry</PER> watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians.
“Ten zero to Ireland!” “What?” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, looking wildly around through <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars.
“But Levski’s got the Quaffle!” “<PER>Harry</PER>, if you’re not going to watch at normal speed, you’re going to miss things!” shouted <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked quickly over the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omni-oculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock.
<PER>Harry</PER> screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes too; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind on the game.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed their descent through <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was “They’re going to crash!” screamed <PER>Hermione</PER> next to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> was using a broomstick at all; <PER>Harry</PER> moved so easily through the air that <PER>Harry</PER> looked unsupported and weightless.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum.
<PER>Harry</PER>, focusing still more closely upon Krum’s face, saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below.
Whatever happened was over so quickly <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa’s long, shrill whistle blast, told <PER>Harry</PER> it had been a foul.
As one, the Weasley boys and <PER>Harry</PER> stuffed their fingers into their ears, but <PER>Hermione</PER>, who hadn’t bothered, was soon tugging on <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to look at her, and her pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers impatiently out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned this way and that, staring through <PER>Harry</PER>'s Omnioculars, as the Quaffle changed hands with the speed of a bullet.
How He could see where He was going, <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> was drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again — “They’re going to crash!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Squinting toward the entrance, <PER>Harry</PER> saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that <PER>Harry</PER>’d been using sign language all day for nothing.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Harry</PER> seemed much less coordinated on the ground.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> went into the next tent, and <PER>Harry</PER> and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks.
“I wouldn’t fancy having to go and tell the Irish the Irish’ve got to stop celebrating.” <PER>Harry</PER>, who was on a top bunk above <PER>Ron</PER>, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of Krum’s more spectacular moves.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> in robes that had <PER>Harry</PER>'s name on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman’s voice echoed throughout the stadium, “I give you PotteA.” <PER>Harry</PER> never knew whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> had actually dropped off to sleep — <PER>Harry</PER>'s fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams — all he knew was that, quite suddenly, Arthur was shouting.
He slipped down from the bunk and reached for He's clothes, but Arthur, who had pulled on He's jeans over He's own pajamas, said, “No time, <PER>Harry</PER> — just grab a jacket and get outside — quickly!” <PER>Harry</PER> did as <PER>Harry</PER> — was told and hurried out of the tent, <PER>Ron</PER> at his heels.
Once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s way with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“C’mon,” said Fred, grabbing <PER>Ginny</PER>’s hand and starting to pull <PER>Ginny</PER>’s's toward the wood.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and George followed.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> yell with pain.
“What happened?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously, stopping so abruptly that <PER>Harry</PER> walked into <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> turned sharply.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> arms folded, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees.
<PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Malfoy</PER> to do something that <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> would never have dared say in front of Molly “Language, Weasley,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, his pale eyes glittering.
“Never mind, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, seizing <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Out there wearing masks, are they?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> turned his face to <PER>Harry</PER>, still smiling.
“Well if they were, I wouldn’t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?” “Oh come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with a disgusted look at <PER>Malfoy</PER>, “let’s go and find the others.” “Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,” sneered <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Come on,” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated, and she pulled <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> up the path again.
When they saw <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, “ Ou est Madame Maxime?
“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling out his wand, lighting it like <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, and squinting up the path.
<PER>Harry</PER> dug in the pockets of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket for <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand — but it wasn’t there.
“Ah, no, I don’t believe it I’ve lost my wand!” “You’re kidding!” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground; <PER>Harry</PER> looked all around <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand was nowhere to be seen.
<PER>Harry</PER> was thinking of Dobby: Every time <PER>Harry</PER> had tried to do something the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s wouldn’t like, the house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up.
“Let’s just keep moving, shall we?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw him glance edgily at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Perhaps there was truth in what <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said; perhaps <PER>Hermione</PER> was in more danger than they were.
They set off again, <PER>Harry</PER> still searching <PER>Harry</PER>'s pockets, even though <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand wasn’t there.
He turned to tell <PER>Ron</PER> this, but <PER>Ron</PER>’s face had gone oddly slack, and next second <PER>Ron</PER> was yelling, “Did I tell you I’ve invented a broomstick that’ll reach Jupiter?” “Honestly\” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Ron</PER> firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away.
<PER>Harry</PER> no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in <PER>Harry</PER>'s step.
“Imagine if your dad catches Lucius <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting down next to <PER>Ron</PER> and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves.
“He’s always said He’d like to get something on He.” “That’d wipe the smirk off old <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s face, all right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked quickly around too.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and peered around the tree.
It was too dark to see very far, but <PER>Harry</PER> could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision.
<PER>Harry</PER> scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see anyone.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come on, move\” <PER>Hermione</PER> had seized the collar of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket and was tugging him backward.
“It’s the Dark Mark, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned, pulling him as hard as <PER>Hermione</PER> could.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s sign!” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s — ?” “<PER>Harry</PER>, come on!” <PER>Harry</PER> turned — <PER>Ron</PER> was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum — the three of them started across the clearing — but before them had taken a few hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.
<PER>Harry</PER> whirled around, and in an instant, <PER>Harry</PER> registered one fact: Each of these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“STUPEFYl” roared twenty voices — there was a blinding series of flashes and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the hair on <PER>Harry</PER>'s head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing.
Raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s head a fraction of an inch <PER>Harry</PER> saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards’ wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness — “Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER>” — his voice sounded shaky — “<PER>Hermione</PER> — are you all right?” “Out of the way, Arthur,” said a cold, curt voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet to face them.
<PER>Hermione</PER> watched him vanish with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth.
<PER>Harry</PER> was reminded forcibly of Dobby in <PER>Harry</PER>'s moments of terrified disobedience.
“Sorry carried away ” “I didn’t drop it there, anyway,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, jerking <PER>Harry</PER>'s thumb toward the trees beneath the skull.
“Winky’s got a squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper!” She looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, appealing for their support.
“It didn’t sound anything like Winky, did It?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> gasp, horrified, as a gigantic serpent-tongued skull erupted from the point where the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them; it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke: the ghost of a spell.
But <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t seem to want to move; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes were still upon the sobbing elf.
She turned and followed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> out of the clearing and off through the trees.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered after him.
With some assistance from <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, Arthur explained what had happened in the woods.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> just picked it up off the ground!” “Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently.
“Of course people panicked it was almost like seeing <PER>Voldemort</PER> back again.” “I don’t get it,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, frowning.
“Dad, we met <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the woods, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> as good as told we <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s dad was one of those nutters in masks!
“If they really were Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when <PER>Voldemort</PER> lost power, and told all sorts of lies about <PER>Voldemort</PER> forcing them to kill and torture people.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to <PER>Harry</PER> now to ease <PER>Harry</PER> to sleep, and it was a long time after Charlie’s snores filled the tent that <PER>Harry</PER> finally dozed off.
“No no, there hasn’t been any post at all.” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked curiously at <PER>Harry</PER>.
With a meaningful look at both of them he said, “All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, <PER>Ron</PER>?” “Yeah think I will too,” said <PER>Ron</PER> at once.
“What’s up, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind they.
“On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s reactions were almost exactly as <PER>Harry</PER> had imagined them back in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom on Privet Drive.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse.
“And remember what Professor Trelawney said?” <PER>Harry</PER> went on, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s terrified look vanished as <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a derisive snort.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, you aren’t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?” “You weren’t there,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked.
“Hedwig’s not going to manage that journey in a few days.” “Yeah, I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but there was a leaden feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach as <PER>Harry</PER> looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.
“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“If Dad hadn’t said anything, old <PER>Rita</PER> would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented,” said Bill, who was playing chess with <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was immersed in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Molly had bought for <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> in Diagon Alley.
<PER>Harry</PER> was polishing <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit <PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> for <PER>Harry</PER>'s thirteenth birthday open at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“A high- ranking Ministry official like Mister Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants — ” “His slave, you mean!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice rising passionately, “because His didn’t pay Winky, did His?” “I think you’d all better go upstairs and check that you’ve packed properly!” said Molly, breaking up the argument.
“Bung him some Owl Treats,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, throwing a packet across to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It might shut <PER>Harry</PER> up.” <PER>Harry</PER> poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon’s cage, then turned to his trunk.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, you don’t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?” “Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, <PER>Harry</PER> had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for <PER>Harry</PER>'s potion- making kit — <PER>Harry</PER> had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna.
— <PER>Harry</PER> was just piling underwear into — <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron when <PER>Ron</PER> made a loud noise of disgust behind — <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Now, mind you pack them properly so them don’t crease.” “Mum, you’ve given me <PER>Ginny</PER>’s new dress,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, handing it out to <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Well, they’re okay!” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily, looking at <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> would willingly have split all the money in <PER>Harry</PER>'s Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew they would never take it.
When <PER>Harry</PER> and the others entered the kitchen, <PER>Harry</PER> and the others saw Molly rummaging anxiously in the drawers — “I’ve got a quill here somewhere!” — and Arthur bending over the fire, talking to — <PER>Harry</PER> shut <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that them were working properly.
“I’d better hurry — you have a good term, boys,” said Arthur to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to Disapparate.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s not what you’d call normal, though, is <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said Fred.
Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were all severely scratched.
They did it in groups today; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> (the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front of them.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train.
“Thanks for having us to stay, Molly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“It’s going to be very exciting — mind you, I’m very glad they’ve changed the rules — ” “What rules?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Fred, and George together.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went back to their compartment.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door. "
” <PER>Hermione</PER> got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid the compartment door shut, blocking out <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice.
After half an hour or so, <PER>Hermione</PER>, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried <PER>Hermione</PER> once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm.
“Oh wow,” said <PER>Neville</PER> enviously as <PER>Ron</PER> tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.
“We were in the Top Box — ” “For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had appeared in the doorway.
“Don’t remember asking you to join us, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> coolly.
A sleeve of <PER>Ron</PER>’s dress robes was dangling from A sleeve of <PER>Ron</PER>’s dress robes, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.
<PER>Ron</PER> made to stuff the robes out of sight, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> was too quick for him; <PER>Malfoy</PER> seized A sleeve of <PER>Ron</PER>’s dress robes and pulled.
“Look at this!” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> in ecstasy, holding up <PER>Ron</PER>’s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley, you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you?
“<PER>Ron</PER>l” said <PER>Hermione</PER> reproachfully, and <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand, muttered “ ReparoV ’ and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door.
“Don’t let <PER>Malfoy</PER> get to you, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “Him!
<PER>Hermione</PER> bundled up Crookshanks in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cloak and <PER>Ron</PER> left his dress robes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour.
“Hi, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform.
“All righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> bellowed back, waving.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> climbed gratefully into one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward Hogwarts Castle.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase.
Drenched and sputtering, <PER>Ron</PER> staggered sideways into <PER>Harry</PER>, just as a second water bomb dropped — narrowly missing <PER>Hermione</PER>, it burst at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet, sending a wave of cold water over <PER>Harry</PER>'s sneakers into <PER>Harry</PER>'s socks.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as <PER>Harry</PER> took aim again.
“Peeves, come down here at ONCE!” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> around the neck to stop <PER>Hermione</PER> from falling.
“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger — ” “That’s all right, Professor!” <PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, massaging <PER>Hermione</PER>'s throat.
“Into the Great Hall, come on!” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right, <PER>Ron</PER> muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost.
“Says who?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, taking off <PER>Harry</PER>'s sneakers and emptying them of water.
“Hiya, <PER>Harry</PER>!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom <PER>Harry</PER> was something of a hero.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
he turned back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Nearly Headless Nick.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, of course, was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t think who else was missing.
On Professor Sinistra ’s other side was the sallow-faced, hook- nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, <PER>Snape</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER>’s least favorite person at Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s loathing of <PER>Snape</PER> was matched only by <PER>Snape</PER> ’s hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when <PER>Harry</PER> had helped Sirius escape right under <PER>Snape</PER> ’s overlarge nose — <PER>Snape</PER> and Sirius had been enemies since their own school days.
On <PER>Snape</PER> ’s other side was an empty seat, which <PER>Harry</PER> guessed was Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s.
The tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s long, thin fingers were together and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s was resting <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s's chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s's half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought.
“Oh hurry up,” <PER>Ron</PER> moaned, beside <PER>Harry</PER>, “I could eat a hippogriff.” The words were no sooner out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell.
If <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked.
All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as them filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school — all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s moleskin overcoat.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught a glimpse of <PER>Cho</PER>, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as <PER>Harry</PER> sat down.
“Baddock, Malcolm!” The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Malfoy</PER> clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins.
“Branstone, Eleanor!” “Cauldwell, Owen!” “Creevey, Dennis!” Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s moleskin, just as <PER>Hagrid</PER> himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table.
About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming — a misleading impression, for <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> knew <PER>Hagrid</PER> to possess a very kind nature.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had gotten to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet.
“ Tuck in.” “Hear, hear!” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> loudly as the empty dishes filled magically before <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> loudly's eyes.
Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> loaded their own plates.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had knocked over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s golden goblet.
“House-elves don’t want sick leave and pensions!” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked down at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hardly touched plate of food, then put <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh c’mon, ’Er-my-knee,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, accidentally spraying <PER>Harry</PER> with bits of Yorkshire pudding.
“You won’t get them sick leave by starving yourself!” “Slave labor,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, breathing hard through <PER>Hermione</PER>'s nose.
“Treacle tart, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, deliberately wafting its smell toward her.
When the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving the puddings sparkling clean, Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet again.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook it, muttering words <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t hear.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger, who shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s right-hand side.
The stranger sat down, shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mane of dark gray hair out of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face, pulled a plate of sausages toward his, raised a plate of sausages toward his to what was left of his nose, and sniffed it.
“Professor Moody.” It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of the staff or students clapped except <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who both put their hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly quickly.
“Moody?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> cleared <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as the Hogwarts champion.
At every House table, <PER>Harry</PER> could see people either gazing raptly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, or else whispering fervently to people's neighbors.
“Yeah, a thousand Galleons ” “Come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “we’ll be the only ones left here if you don’t move.” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways in which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.
<PER>Hermione</PER> cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look, and <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly heard <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mutter “ Slave labor,” before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls’ dormitory.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> climbed up the last, spiral staircase until <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> reached <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>'s own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> got into their pajamas and into bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> grinned into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillow, exceptionally glad that <PER>Ron</PER> couldn’t see what <PER>Harry</PER> could.
The storm had blown The storm out by the following morning, though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> examined their new course schedules at breakfast.
Professor Trelawney kept predicting <PER>Harry</PER>’s death, which <PER>Harry</PER> found extremely annoying.
“You should have given it up like me, shouldn’t you?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly, buttering <PER>Hermione</PER> some toast.
“Then you’d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy.” “You’re eating again, I notice,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, watching <PER>Hermione</PER> adding liberal amounts of jam to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s toast too.
A large tawny owl soared down to <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom and deposited a parcel into <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom's lap — <PER>Neville</PER> almost always forgot to pack something.
On the other side of the Hall <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home.
Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, <PER>Harry</PER> returned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s porridge.
“Mornin’!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The speaker was <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“What is the point of they?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a few seconds’ pause, then he said roughly, “Tha’s next lesson, <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
Nothing but deep affection for <PER>Hagrid</PER> could have made <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts.
“Eurgh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, what’s that pointy thing on it?” “Ah, some of ’em have got stings,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> enthusiastically (Lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box).
“Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a dragon for a pet, would you?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grinned at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> knew only too well — he had owned one for a brief period during their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of Norbert.
“They are now,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in an exasperated voice, “but once <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s found out what they eat, I expect they’ll be six feet long.” “Well, that won’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something, will it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning slyly at her.
“You know perfectly well I only said that to shut <PER>Malfoy</PER> up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> began to eat so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at her.
“You’re going to make yourself puke instead?” “No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with as much dignity as <PER>Hermione</PER> could muster with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth bulging with sprouts.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> leapt to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, said, “See you at dinner!” and departed at high speed.
When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> set off for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where Professor Trelawney lived.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat down at the same small circular table.
A very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at <PER>Harry</PER> with the tragic expression Professor Trelawney always wore whenever Professor Trelawney saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> rolled his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>, who looked stonily back.
“ ‘I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ’ ” But <PER>Hermione</PER> was right, <PER>Harry</PER> thought irritably, Professor Trelawney really was an old fraud.
Except, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made the prediction about <PER>Voldemort</PER> rising again and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine, when <PER>Harry</PER> had described it to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>\” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered.
“What?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around; the whole class was staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat up straight; <PER>Harry</PER> had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts.
“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said <PER>Harry</PER> after a while, frowning down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s piece of parchment, “that can’t be right, can it?” “Aaaaah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, imitating Professor Trelawney’s mystical whisper, “when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, <PER>Harry</PER> ” Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown — “Oh Professor, look!
“Get stuffed, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?” “You know your mother, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> — both he and <PER>Hermione</PER> had grabbed the back of <PER>Ron</PER>’s robes to stop him from launching himself at <PER>Malfoy</PER> — “that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under shis nose?
Several people screamed — <PER>Harry</PER> felt something white-hot graze the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face — <PER>Harry</PER> plunged <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand into <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes for his wand, but before his’d even touched it, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a second loud BANG, and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall.
Moody turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER> — at least, <PER>Harry</PER>'s normal eye was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>; the other one was pointing into the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was coming down the marble staircase with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s arms full of books.
“No!” cried Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> got to <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s feet, wincing.
“Surely Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told you that?” “Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might’ve mentioned it, yeah,” said Moody, scratching Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s chin unconcernedly, “but I thought a good sharp shock — ” “We give detentions, Moody!
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wand at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms.
“Don’t talk to me,” <PER>Ron</PER> said quietly to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, the amazing bouncing ferret ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both laughed, and <PER>Hermione</PER> began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.
“It was good, really, that Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stopped it — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> furiously, his eyes snapping open again, “you’re ruining the best moment of my life!” <PER>Hermione</PER> made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again.
“We had him this afternoon,” him told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave <PER>Neville</PER> detention, and <PER>Neville</PER> returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.
“You know why <PER>Snape</PER> ’s in such a foul mood, don’t you?” said <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> as they watched <PER>Hermione</PER> teaching <PER>Neville</PER> a Scouring Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails.
“Moody.” It was common knowledge that <PER>Snape</PER> really wanted the Dark Arts job, and <PER>Snape</PER> had now failed to get it for the fourth year running.
<PER>Snape</PER> had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it — but <PER>Snape</PER> seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody.
Indeed, whenever <PER>Harry</PER> saw the two of them together — at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors — <PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct impression that <PER>Snape</PER> was avoiding Moody’s eye, whether magical or normal.
“I reckon <PER>Snape</PER>’s a bit scared of <PER>Snape</PER>’s, you know,” <PER>Harry</PER> said thoughtfully.
“Imagine if Moody turned <PER>Snape</PER> into a horned toad,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, his eyes misting over, “and bounced him all around him's dungeon.
Moody’s magical eye spun around to stare at <PER>Ron</PER>; <PER>Ron</PER> looked extremely apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled — the first time <PER>Harry</PER> had seen him do so.
“So do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law?” Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ron</PER> recoil slightly next to <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Ron</PER> hated spiders.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was talking about the days in which <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been all-powerful.
her was looking, not at the spider, but at <PER>Neville</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>, following her gaze, saw that <PER>Neville</PER>’s hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, him's knuckles white, him's eyes wide and horrified.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been picturing <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since <PER>Harry</PER>’d found out they had been murdered, ever since <PER>Harry</PER>’d found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’ whereabouts to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, who had come to find them at them's cottage.
How <PER>Voldemort</PER> had killed <PER>Harry</PER>’s father first.
How James Potter had tried to hold James Potter off, while James Potter shouted at James Potter's wife to take <PER>Harry</PER> and run <PER>Voldemort</PER> had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill <PER>Harry</PER> how her had begged <PER>Harry</PER> to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son and so <PER>Voldemort</PER> had murdered her too, before turning his wand on <PER>Harry</PER> .
<PER>Harry</PER> knew these details because <PER>Harry</PER> had heard <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ voices when <PER>Harry</PER> had fought the dementors last year — for that was the terrible power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair .
With a massive effort, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> back to the present and listened to what Moody was saying.
Most people were discussing the curses in awed voices — “Did you see it twitch?” “ — and when he killed it — just like that!” They were talking about the lesson, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as though it had been some sort of spectacular show, but <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t found it very entertaining — and nor, it seemed, had <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Hurry up,” she said tensely to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Neville</PER>.” <PER>Neville</PER> was standing alone, halfway up a side passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look him had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.
“<PER>Neville</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> said gently.
“Oh hello,” <PER>Neville</PER> said, <PER>Neville</PER>'s voice much higher than usual.
“Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what’s for eating?” <PER>Ron</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a startled look.
“What was that about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, watching <PER>Neville</PER> and Moody turn the corner.
“Some lesson, though, eh?” said <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> as they set off for the Great Hall.
<PER>Hermione</PER> did not join in with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s conversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and <PER>Harry</PER>, who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.
“Wouldn’t Moody and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we’d seen the curses?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked as they approached the Fat Lady.
“But <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s always done things <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s way, hasn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and Moody’s been getting in trouble for years, I reckon.
“You all right, <PER>Neville</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> thought I’d like this.” Telling <PER>Neville</PER> what Professor Sprout had said, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering <PER>Neville</PER> up, for <PER>Neville</PER> very rarely heard that <PER>Harry</PER> was good at anything.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month.
“You know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, “I think it’s back to the old Divination standby.” “What — make it up?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write.
“You know her — just put in loads of misery, shell lap it up.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, crumpling up <PER>Harry</PER>'s first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire.
Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared inscrutably at <PER>Harry</PER>, rather as <PER>Hermione</PER> might look if <PER>Hermione</PER> knew they weren’t doing <PER>Hermione</PER> knew they were's homework properly.
<PER>Harry</PER> grinned and quickly returned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s predictions — <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want George to think <PER>Harry</PER> was eavesdropping.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sat down, laid the things <PER>Hermione</PER> was carrying in an empty armchair, and pulled <PER>Ron</PER>’s predictions toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> laid down <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill too, having just finished predicting <PER>Harry</PER>'s own death by decapitation.
“Funny you should ask,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with a nasty look at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, of course you haven’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly, “I’ve only just started it.” “Yeah?” said <PER>Ron</PER> in mild surprise.
<PER>Harry</PER> hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s knee, hooting softly.
<PER>Harry</PER> read it aloud: <PER>Harry</PER> — I’m flying north immediately.
My best to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Sirius <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who stared back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“HeHe’s coming back?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s reading what signs?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking perplexed.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — what’s up?” For <PER>Harry</PER> had just hit <PER>Harry</PER> in the forehead with <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist, jolting Hedwig out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s lap.
“I shouldn’t’ve told <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> said furiously.
“It’s made him think him’s got to come back!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, now slamming <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of <PER>Ron</PER>’s chair, hooting indignantly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> began, in a pacifying sort of voice.
“See you in the morning.” Upstairs in the dormitory <PER>Harry</PER> pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas and got into <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t feel remotely tired.
If Sirius came back and got caught, it would be <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s, fault.
For a long time, <PER>Harry</PER> lay staring up at the dark canopy of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
The dormitory was completely silent, and, had <PER>Harry</PER> been less preoccupied, <PER>Harry</PER> would have realized that the absence of <PER>Neville</PER>’s usual snores meant that <PER>Harry</PER> was not the only one lying awake.
Early next morning, <PER>Harry</PER> woke with a plan fully formed in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleeping brain had been working on it all night.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking <PER>Ron</PER>, and went back down to the deserted common room.
Here <PER>Harry</PER> took a piece of parchment from the table upon which <PER>Harry</PER>'s Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter: Dear Sirius, I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to Dear Sirius last time.
It took <PER>Harry</PER> a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, as her kept shuffling around on her perch, showing <PER>Harry</PER> her tail.
In the end, it was <PER>Harry</PER> suggesting her might be too tired, and that perhaps <PER>Harry</PER> would ask <PER>Ron</PER> to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it.
“Just find him, all right?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, stroking her back as <PER>Harry</PER> carried her on <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm to one of the holes in the wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched Shis fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been so sure that Sirius’s reply would alleviate <PER>Harry</PER>'s worries rather than increasing them.
“That was a lie, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply over breakfast, when he told <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER> what he had done.
“He’s not going back to Azkaban because of me.” “Drop it,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sharply to <PER>Hermione</PER> as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, <PER>Hermione</PER> heeded him, and fell silent.
<PER>Harry</PER> did <PER>Harry</PER>'s best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks.
True, <PER>Harry</PER> could not stop <PER>Harry</PER> from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before <PER>Harry</PER> went to sleep, prevent <PER>Harry</PER> from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes <PER>Harry</PER> tried to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind off <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather.
“You said — to use it against another human was — ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants you taught what it feels like,” said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto <PER>Hermione</PER> and fixing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s with an eerie, unblinking stare.
<PER>Hermione</PER> went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that <PER>Hermione</PER> wanted to leave.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grinned at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched as, one by one, <PER>Harry</PER>'s classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence.
<PER>Neville</PER> performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics <PER>Neville</PER> would certainly not have been capable of in <PER>Neville</PER>'s normal state.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice, echoing in some distant chamber of <PER>Harry</PER>'s empty brain: Jump onto the desk jump onto the desk .
<PER>Harry</PER> bent <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees obediently, preparing to spring.
<PER>Harry</PER> had both jumped and tried to prevent <PER>Harry</PER> from jumping — the result was that he’d smashed headlong into the desk, knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.
“Now, that’s more like it!” growled Moody’s voice, and suddenly, <PER>Harry</PER> felt the empty, echoing feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head disappear.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees seemed to double.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that them had received top marks for them's homework in them's next Divination class.
“I will not,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> flatly when <PER>Hagrid</PER> had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra- large toy out of his sack.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> put down <PER>Malfoy</PER> was particularly satisfying, especially because <PER>Malfoy</PER> had done his very best to get <PER>Hagrid</PER> sacked the previous year.
“Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can’t even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which <PER>Neville</PER> had accidentally transplanted <PER>Neville</PER>'s own ears onto a cactus.
Behind the teachers’ table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a large letter H. <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down beside Fred and George at the Gryffindor table.
“Thought any more about trying to enter?” “I asked <PER>McGonagall</PER> how the champions are chosen but <PER>McGonagall</PER> wasn’t telling,” said George bitterly.
“<PER>McGonagall</PER> says the champions get awarded points according to how well they’ve done the tasks.” “Who are the judges?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and everyone looked around at <PER>Hermione</PER>, rather surprised, “because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.” She noticed them all looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and said, with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books <PER>Hermione</PER> had, “It’s all in Hogwarts, A History.
“Not once, in over a thousand pages, does Hogwarts, A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves!” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and applied <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s scrambled eggs.
His and <PER>Ron</PER>’s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s determination to pursue justice for house-elves.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had been badgering <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> ever since, first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses.
Some people, like <PER>Neville</PER>, had paid up just to stop <PER>Hermione</PER> from glowering at them.
“Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “No, of course not,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> curtly, “I hardly think students are supposed to — ” “Well, we have,” said George, indicating Fred, “loads of times, to nick food.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> stopped talking abruptly; <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> watched Hedwig anxiously as <PER>Hermione</PER> fluttered down onto <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, folded <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wings, and held out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s leg wearily.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled off Sirius’s reply and offered Hedwig <PER>Harry</PER>'s bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully.
Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in further discussions about the Tri-wizard Tournament, <PER>Harry</PER> read out Sirius’s letter in a whisper to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
When the bell rang early, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall.
“Weasley, straighten your hat,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> snapped at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, standing between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the fourth row from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage — a shoe the size of a child’s sled — followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, and that was <PER>Hagrid</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> started to clap; the students, following <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, though tall <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, had barely to bend to kiss it.
“But ze ’orses — ” “Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other — er — charges.” “Skrewts,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“How big d’you reckon Durmstrang’s horses are going to be?” Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, if they’re any bigger than this lot, even <PER>Hagrid</PER> won’t be able to handle them,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s a mast!” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
All of them, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, seemed to be built along the lines of Crabbe and Goyle but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that their were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!
“Dear old Hogwarts,” he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Harry</PER>'s smile did not extend to <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, which remained cold and shrewd.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need the punch on the arm <PER>Ron</PER> gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — it’s Krum\” t'fyfflapier- l6 “I don’t believe it!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang.
“You haven’t got a quill, have you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Nope, they’re upstairs in my bag,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug about this.
“Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> scathingly.
<PER>Harry</PER> was surprised to see that <PER>Harry</PER> added four chairs, two on either side of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s.
He slid into his seat at the end and waved at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> with a very heavily bandaged hand.
“Skrewts doing all right, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> called.
“When you’ve both put your eyes back in,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly, “you’ll be able to see who’s just arrived.” <PER>Hermione</PER> was pointing up at the staff table.
Remembering Bartemius Crouch in Bartemius Crouch's neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> looked strange in wizard’s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s long white hair and beard.
Perhaps <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had noticed the listening students's sudden stillness, for <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “The casket, then, if you please, Mister Filch.” Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached <PER>Dumbledore</PER> carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels.
“You’ll try and get in, won’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> thought briefly of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament filled himself's mind again.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered how angry <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the Age Line.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” But this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s students.
“I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting boy — ” Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped to let <PER>Harry</PER> walk through first.
He turned He's head back to <PER>Harry</PER> and stared at <PER>Harry</PER> as though He couldn’t believe He's eyes.
Karkaroff s eyes moved slowly up <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and fixed upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar.
Out of the corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye, <PER>Harry</PER> saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends.
“Done it,” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m not sure this is going to work, you know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> warningly “I’m sure <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will have thought of this.” Fred, George, and Lee ignored her.
Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> surveyed Fred and George, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes twinkling.
“What’re we going to do today, then?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.
“We haven’t been down to visit <PER>Hagrid</PER> yet,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Okay,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “just as long as he doesn’t ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts.” A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face.
“Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?” “What is it with her?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, exasperated, as <PER>Hermione</PER> ran away up the marble staircase.
“Hey, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly.
“What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who aren’t chosen?” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to <PER>Harry</PER> as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire.
<PER>Harry</PER> knocked on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s door, and Fang’s booming barks answered instantly “ ’Bout time!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, when he’d flung open the door.
“Thought you lot’d forgotten where I live!” “We’ve been really busy, Hag — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> started to say, but then <PER>Hermione</PER> stopped dead, looking up at <PER>Hagrid</PER>, apparently lost for words.
For a moment, <PER>Hermione</PER> goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Erm — where are the skrewts?” “Out by the pumpkin patch,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> happily.
A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching <PER>Hagrid</PER> darning his socks and arguing with <PER>Hermione</PER> about house-elves — for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W.
By half past five it was growing dark, and <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast — and, more important, the announcement of the school champions.
Coughing, <PER>Ron</PER> said, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what’s that?” “Eh?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, turning around with a large bottle in his hand.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “And what’s with the hair and the suit?” said <PER>Harry</PER> in an undertone.
Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that <PER>Hagrid</PER> wouldn’t spot them, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from the Beauxbatons students's carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too.
They couldn’t hear what <PER>Hagrid</PER> was saying, but he was talking to Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression <PER>Harry</PER> had only ever seen <PER>Harry</PER> wear once before — when <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking at the baby dragon, Norbert.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s going up to the castle with her!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> indignantly.
“I thought <PER>Harry</PER> was waiting for us!” Without so much as a backward glance at <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin, <PER>Hagrid</PER> was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beauxbatons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.
<PER>Ron</PER> watched Viktor Krum excitedly, but Viktor Krum did not look around as Viktor Krum reached the front doors a little ahead of <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> and proceeded through them.
“Hope it’s Angelina,” said Fred as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat down.
Perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as <PER>Harry</PER> would have normally.
Like everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had finished eating yet, <PER>Harry</PER> simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions.
At long last, the plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> caught the piece of parchment and held the piece of parchment at arm’s length, so that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber.
“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “is Fleur Delacour!” “It’s her, <PER>Ron</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!” “No!” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, but nobody heard him except <PER>Harry</PER>; the uproar from the next table was too great.
Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could make <PER>Dumbledore</PER> heard again.
There was a long pause, during which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared at the slip in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hands, and everyone in the room stared at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
And then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cleared <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s throat and read out — “ <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> sat, frozen, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat.
Up at the top table, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had got to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>; beyond them, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the long Gryffindor table all watching <PER>Harry</PER>, openmouthed.
At the top table, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had straightened up, nodding to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, trod on the hem of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, and stumbled slightly.
It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn’t seem to be getting any nearer at all, and <PER>Harry</PER> could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon <PER>Harry</PER>, as though each were a searchlight.
“Well through the door, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> went through the door out of the Great Hall and found <PER>Harry</PER> in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards.
The faces in the portraits turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> entered.
He took <PER>Harry</PER> by the arm and led <PER>Harry</PER> forward.
Cedric looked from Bagman to <PER>Harry</PER> and back again as though sure <PER>Harry</PER> must have misheard what Bagman had said.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> closed the door.
“Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!” Somewhere under <PER>Harry</PER>’s numb disbelief <PER>Harry</PER> felt a ripple of anger.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was now looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>, who looked right back at Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon spectacles.
“Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> was very aware of everybody watching <PER>Harry</PER> closely.
“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, ignoring <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was now shaking <PER>Snape</PER>'s head, <PER>Snape</PER>'s lip curling.
“<PER>Snape</PER> could not have crossed the Age Line,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> sharply.
“It is possible, of course,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> politely “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> angrily.
“I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody.” <PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was saying was barely worth <PER>Harry</PER>'s notice, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands gave him away; they had balled they into fists.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered for a moment whom <PER>Harry</PER> was speaking to, but then realized “Mad-Eye” could hardly be Moody’s real first name.
Close up, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> looked ill.
There were dark shadows beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and a thin, papery look about <PER>Harry</PER>'s wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling at both of <PER>Harry</PER>, Cedric.
The inside of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain had been ransacked.
“How did you get your name in?” “I didn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell Cedric didn’t believe <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood listening to <PER>Harry</PER> going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, <PER>Harry</PER> started to climb the marble ones.
Was anyone except <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> going to believe <PER>Harry</PER>, or would they all think him’d put <PER>Harry</PER> in for the tournament?
Yet how could anyone think that, when <PER>Harry</PER> was facing competitors who’d had three years’ more magical education than <PER>Harry</PER> had — when <PER>Harry</PER> was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people?
Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>’d thought about it <PER>Harry</PER>’d fantasized about it but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream he’d never really, seriously considered entering.
Yes, someone wanted <PER>Harry</PER> dead, someone had wanted <PER>Harry</PER> dead ever since <PER>Harry</PER> had been a year old Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
But how could <PER>Voldemort</PER> have ensured that <PER>Harry</PER>’s name got into the Goblet of Fire?
Yet in that dream <PER>Voldemort</PER> had had, just before <PER>Voldemort</PER> had awoken with <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar hurting, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not been alone <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been talking to Wormtail plotting <PER>Harry</PER>’s murder .
<PER>Harry</PER> got a shock to find <PER>Harry</PER> facing the Fat Lady already.
<PER>Harry</PER> had barely noticed where <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet were carrying <PER>Harry</PER>.
The blast of noise that met <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked <PER>Harry</PER> backward.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t get away; whenever <PER>Harry</PER> tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around <PER>Harry</PER> closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on <PER>Harry</PER>, stuffing crisps and peanuts into <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
Everyone wanted to know how <PER>Harry</PER> had done it, how <PER>Harry</PER> had tricked <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Age Line and managed to get <PER>Harry</PER>'s name into the goblet.
“I didn’t,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, over and over again, “I don’t know how it happened.” But for all the notice anyone took, <PER>Harry</PER> might just as well not have answered at all.
“No, seriously, George — I’m going to bed — ” George — I wanted more than anything to find <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room.
Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, <PER>Harry</PER> managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
To his great relief, his found <PER>Ron</PER> was lying on his found <PER>Ron</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER>'s bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed.
He looked up when <PER>Harry</PER> slammed the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly became aware that <PER>Harry</PER> was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> lay on the bed without moving, watching <PER>Harry</PER> struggle to remove it.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, “To kill me.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into He's hair.
When <PER>Harry</PER> woke up on Sunday morning, it took <PER>Harry</PER> a moment to remember why <PER>Harry</PER> felt so miserable and worried.
He sat up and ripped back the curtains of He's own four-poster, intending to talk to <PER>Ron</PER>, to force <PER>Ron</PER> to believe He — only to find that <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed was empty; He had obviously gone down to breakfast.
It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> exactly what had happened after <PER>Harry</PER> had left the Gryffindor table the night before.
“What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’?” “Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, isn’t it obvious?” <PER>Hermione</PER> said despairingly.
“I know you don’t ask for it but — well — you know, <PER>Ron</PER>’s got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you’re <PER>Ron</PER>’s's best friend, and you’re really famous — <PER>Ron</PER>’s’s always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and <PER>Ron</PER>’s puts up with it, and <PER>Ron</PER>never mentions it, but I suppose this is just one time too many.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s going to find out anyway — ” “How?” <PER>Harry</PER>, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, very seriously.
“<PER>Harry</PER> told me not to use Hedwig again.” “Ask <PER>Ron</PER> if you can borrow — ” “I’m not asking <PER>Ron</PER> for anything,” <PER>Harry</PER> said flatly.
They went up to the Owlery <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a piece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches, looking at all the different owls, while <PER>Harry</PER> sat down against a wall and wrote <PER>Harry</PER>'s letter.
The other Hogwarts champion had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside The other Hogwarts champion's chest since last night, but The other Hogwarts champion couldn’t think how to translate this into words, so The other Hogwarts champion simply dipped The other Hogwarts champion's quill back into the ink bottle and wrote, Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak — <PER>Harry</PER> “Finished,” he told <PER>Hermione</PER>, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes.
She kept Shis back to <PER>Harry</PER> all the time <PER>Harry</PER> was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl.
“First <PER>Ron</PER>, then you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
“ This isn’t my fault.” If <PER>Harry</PER> had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of <PER>Harry</PER> being champion, the following day showed <PER>Harry</PER> how mistaken <PER>Harry</PER> was.
<PER>Harry</PER> could no longer avoid the rest of the school once <PER>Harry</PER> was back at lessons — and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought <PER>Harry</PER> had entered <PER>Harry</PER> for the tournament.
Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch- Fletchley, with whom <PER>Harry</PER> normally got on very well, did not talk to <PER>Harry</PER> even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from <PER>Harry</PER>’s grip and smacked <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the face.
<PER>Ron</PER> wasn’t talking to <PER>Harry</PER> either.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered <PER>Hermione</PER>'s normally, both avoided making eye contact with each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with <PER>Harry</PER> — but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have been looking forward to seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too — the first time <PER>Harry</PER> would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion.
Predictably, <PER>Malfoy</PER> arrived at <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place.
He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to <PER>Harry</PER> and said, very seriously, “So — yer competin’, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No idea who put yeh in fer it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s words.
“Yeh say it wasn’ you, an’ I believe yeh — an’ <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believes yer, an’ all.” “Wish I knew who did do it,” said <PER>Harry</PER> bitterly.
<PER>Harry</PER> assumed <PER>Harry</PER> was talking about the skrewts, because <PER>Harry</PER>'s classmates certainly weren’t; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts’ ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.
“Ah, I don’ know, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> sighed suddenly, looking back down at <PER>Harry</PER> with a worried expression on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
Yes, everything did seem to happen to <PER>Harry</PER> that was more or less what <PER>Hermione</PER> had said as they had walked around the lake, and that was the reason, according to <PER>Hermione</PER>, that <PER>Ron</PER> was no longer talking to <PER>Harry</PER>.
He thought He could have coped with the rest of the school’s behavior if He could just have had <PER>Ron</PER> back as a friend, but He wasn’t going to try and persuade <PER>Ron</PER> to talk to He if <PER>Ron</PER> didn’t want to.
“It’s really not that difficult, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> tried to reassure him as they left Flitwick’s class — <PER>Hermione</PER> had been making objects zoom across the room to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s all lesson, as though <PER>Hermione</PER> were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes.
“You just weren’t concentrating properly “Wonder why that was,” said <PER>Harry</PER> darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER> were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt.
Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with <PER>Snape</PER> and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish <PER>Harry</PER> as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing <PER>Harry</PER> could imagine.
<PER>Harry</PER> had already struggled through one Friday’s worth, with <PER>Hermione</PER> sitting next to <PER>Harry</PER> intoning “ignore them, ignore them, ignore them” under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see why today should be any better.
When he and <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived at <PER>Snape</PER> ’s dungeon after lunch, he and <PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Hermione</PER> found the Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of he and <PER>Hermione</PER> wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes.
badges — then <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage: Support CEDRIC DIGGORY — The REAL Hogwarts Champion “Like them, Potter?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> loudly as <PER>Harry</PER> approached.
“And this isn’t all they do — look!” <PER>Harry</PER> pressed <PER>Harry</PER>'s badge into <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowed green: The Slytherins howled with laughter.
“Oh very funny,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and Pansy Parkinson's gang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, “really witty.” <PER>Ron</PER> was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus.
“Want one, Granger?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, holding out a badge to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said warningly.
“Go on, then, Potter,” <PER>Malfoy</PER> said quietly, drawing out <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s own wand.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s front teeth — already larger than average — were now growing at an alarming rate; <PER>Hermione</PER> was looking more and more like a beaver as <PER>Hermione</PER>'s teeth elongated, past <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bottom lip, toward <PER>Hermione</PER>'s chin — panic-stricken, <PER>Hermione</PER> felt them and let out a terrified cry.
The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; <PER>Snape</PER> pointed a long yellow finger at <PER>Malfoy</PER> and said, “Explain.” “Potter attacked me, sir — ” “We attacked each other at the same time!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“ — and <PER>Snape</PER> hit Goyle — look — ” <PER>Snape</PER> examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> got <PER>Hermione</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> said.
“Loo!d” He forced <PER>Hermione</PER> to show <PER>Snape</PER> her teeth — she was doing shis best to hide them with shis hands, though this was difficult as them had now grown down past shis collar.
Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at <PER>Hermione</PER> from behind <PER>Snape</PER> ’s back.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked coldly at <PER>Hermione</PER>, then said, “I see no difference.” <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a whimper; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes filled with tears, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.
It was lucky, perhaps, that both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> started shouting at <PER>Snape</PER> at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him.
<PER>Snape</PER> passed <PER>Snape</PER>, walked with <PER>Ron</PER> to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table.
<PER>Ron</PER> was shaking with anger too — for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal between them, but then <PER>Ron</PER> turned and sat down with Dean and Seamus instead, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> alone at <PER>Harry</PER>'s table.
On the other side of the dungeon, <PER>Malfoy</PER> turned his back on <PER>Snape</PER> and pressed his badge, smirking.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat there staring at <PER>Snape</PER> as the lesson began, picturing horrific things happening to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was going to poison <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> imagined picking up <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on <PER>Snape</PER>’s greasy head — And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on <PER>Harry</PER>’s thoughts.
It was Colin Creevey; Colin Creevey edged into the room, beaming at <PER>Harry</PER>, and walked up to <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk at the front of the room.
“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take <PER>Harry</PER> Potter upstairs.” <PER>Snape</PER> stared down sir's hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from sir's eager face.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly.
He chanced half a glance at <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was staring determinedly at the ceiling.
“Potter — take your bag and get out of my sight!” <PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, got up, and headed for the door.
“It’s amazing, isn’t it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said Colin, starting to speak the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had closed the dungeon door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“She’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet ” “Maybe not that small, Ludo,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, her eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I wonder if I could have a little word with <PER>Harry</PER> before we start?” she said to Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That is — if <PER>Harry</PER> has no objection?” “Er — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Lovely,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had <PER>Harry</PER>’s upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and her was steering <PER>Harry</PER> out of the room again and opening a nearby door.
“Come along, dear — that’s right — lovely,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing <PER>Harry</PER> down onto a cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them into darkness.
“Testing my name is <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked down quickly at the quill.
The moment <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had spoken, the quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment: Attractive blonde <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, forty-three, whose savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations “Lovely,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, yet again, and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled the top piece of parchment up, and stuffed the top piece of parchment into <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's handbag.
Now <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter leaned toward <PER>Harry</PER> and said, “So, <PER>Harry</PER> what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament?” “Er — ” said <PER>Harry</PER> again, but <PER>Harry</PER> was distracted by the quill.
Even though <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in it wake <PER>Harry</PER> could make out a fresh sentence: An ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, whose eyes “Ignore the quill, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter firmly.
Reluctantly, <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's instead.
“Now — why did you decide to enter the tournament, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “I didn’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ <PER>Dumbledore</PER>l” cried <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, with every appearance of delight — but <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess Remover, and <PER>Rita</PER>’s clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodile-skin bag.
“I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and that many wizards in the street — ” “I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, <PER>Rita</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, with a courteous bow and a smile, “but I’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter settled <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter down in a corner; <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's slip the parchment out of <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's bag again, spread the parchment on <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment on <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter.
<PER>Harry</PER> had met Mister Ollivander before — <PER>Harry</PER> was the wand-maker from whom <PER>Harry</PER> had bought <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley.
“One of my grandmuzzer’s.” So Fleur was part veela, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, making a mental note to tell <PER>Ron</PER> then <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Ron</PER> wasn’t speaking to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> gathered a fistful of robe from <PER>Harry</PER>'s knee and tried to rub a fistful of robe from <PER>Harry</PER>'s knee clean surreptitiously.
“Which leaves Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and walked past Krum to Mister Ollivander.
<PER>Harry</PER> handed over <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last <PER>Harry</PER> had found the one that suited <PER>Harry</PER> — this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix.
“Curious,” he had said, “curious,” and not until <PER>Harry</PER> asked what was curious had Mister Ollivander explained that the phoenix feather in <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very fond of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and as far as <PER>Harry</PER> was concerned its relation to <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand was something it couldn’t help — rather as <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help being related to Aunt Petunia.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a funny feeling <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill did.
Eventually, however, <PER>Harry</PER> made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to <PER>Harry</PER>, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.
“You may go back to your lessons now — or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end — ” Feeling that at last something had gone right today, <PER>Harry</PER> got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“All the judges and champions, what do you think, <PER>Rita</PER>?” “Er — yes, let’s do those first,” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, whose eyes were upon <PER>Harry</PER> again.
The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging <PER>Harry</PER> into greater prominence.
<PER>Hermione</PER> wasn’t there — <PER>Harry</PER> supposed <PER>Hermione</PER> was still in the hospital wing having <PER>Hermione</PER>'s teeth fixed.
— <PER>Harry</PER> ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that — <PER>Harry</PER> had to do.
Up in the dormitory, <PER>Harry</PER> came across <PER>Ron</PER>.
“And we’ve got to do we detentions tomorrow night, <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> then walked straight out of the room, not looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> considered going after <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t sure whether <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to talk to <PER>Harry</PER> or hit <PER>Harry</PER>, both seemed quite appealing — but the lure of Sirius’s answer was too strong.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never suffered nerves like these; these were way beyond anything <PER>Harry</PER> had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even He's last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup.
<PER>Harry</PER> was finding it hard to think about the future at all; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s whole life had been leading up to, and would finish with, the first task.
Admittedly, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t see how Sirius was going to make <PER>Harry</PER> feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> wrote back to Sirius saying that <PER>Harry</PER> would be beside the common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question.
In the meantime, life became even worse for <PER>Harry</PER> within the confines of the castle, for <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had published <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of <PER>Harry</PER>; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about <PER>Harry</PER>, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.
the article had appeared ten days ago, and <PER>Harry</PER> still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach every time <PER>Harry</PER> thought about it.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had reported <PER>Harry</PER> saying an awful lot of things that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t remember ever saying in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, let alone in that broom cupboard.
But <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had gone even further than transforming <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's “er’s” into long, sickly sentences: <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had interviewed other people about him too.
<PER>Harry</PER> close friend, Colin Creevey, says that <PER>Harry</PER> is rarely seen out of the company of one <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger, a stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like <PER>Harry</PER>, is one of the top students in the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, <PER>Harry</PER> had had to endure people — Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> passed and making sneering comments.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt the color rising in <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had come in for <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fair share of unpleasantness too, but <PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact, <PER>Harry</PER> was full of admiration for the way <PER>Hermione</PER> was handling the situation.
“What was she judging against — a chipmunk?” “Ignore it,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said in a dignified voice, holding <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head in the air and stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though <PER>Hermione</PER> couldn’t hear the sniggering Slytherin girls.
“Just ignore it, <PER>Harry</PER>.” But <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t ignore it.
<PER>Ron</PER> hadn’t spoken to <PER>Harry</PER> at all since <PER>Harry</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> about <PER>Snape</PER>’s detentions.
<PER>Harry</PER> had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats’ brains in <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, but that had been the day <PER>Rita</PER>’s article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed <PER>Ron</PER>’s belief that <PER>Harry</PER> was really enjoying all the attention.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was furious with the pair of them; <PER>Hermione</PER> went from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but <PER>Harry</PER> was adamant: <PER>Harry</PER> would talk to <PER>Ron</PER> again only if <PER>Ron</PER> admitted that <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t put his name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for calling him a liar.
<PER>Harry</PER> liked <PER>Hermione</PER> very much, but <PER>Hermione</PER> just wasn’t the same as <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t mastered Summoning Charms, <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and <PER>Hermione</PER> insisted that learning the theory would help.
Viktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered what <PER>Harry</PER> was up to.
<PER>Hermione</PER> often complained about Krum being there — not that he ever bothered them — but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves, and <PER>Hermione</PER> found the noise distracting.
Quite apart from liking to get Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine <PER>Ron</PER>’s expression if him another pang could have heard <PER>Hermione</PER> talking about Wonky- Faints.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s feeling of barely controlled panic was with <PER>Harry</PER> wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went, as everpresent as the snide comments about the Daily Prophet article.
<PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> that it would do <PER>Harry</PER> good to get away from the castle for a bit, and <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need much persuasion.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, this is so stupid — ” “I’ll come, but I’m not meeting <PER>Ron</PER>, and I’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak.” “Oh all right then ” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped, “but I hate talking to you in that cloak, I never know if I’m looking at you or not.” So <PER>Harry</PER> put on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory, went back downstairs, and together he and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off for Hogsmeade.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt wonderfully free under the cloak; <PER>Harry</PER> watched other students walking past them as them entered the village, most of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory\ badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and nobody was quoting that stupid article.
“Look behind you.” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's photographer friend had just emerged from the Three Broomsticks pub.
Talking in low voices, they passed right by <PER>Hermione</PER> without looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> backed into the wall of Honeydukes to stop <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter from hitting him with <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's crocodile-skin handbag.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t mention this; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t discussed what was coming in the first task much; <PER>Harry</PER> had the feeling she didn’t want to think about it.
“She’s gone,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking right through <PER>Harry</PER> toward the end of the street.
<PER>Harry</PER> edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while <PER>Hermione</PER> went to buy drinks.
On his way through the pub, <PER>Harry</PER> spotted <PER>Ron</PER>, who was sitting with Fred, George, and Lee Jordan.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s names at the top of the very short list.
<PER>Harry</PER> took a swig of butterbeer under <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak.
<PER>Hermione</PER> lapsed into thoughtful silence, while <PER>Harry</PER> drank <PER>Harry</PER>'s butterbeer, watching the people in the pub.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest seemed to ease slightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> would be speaking to <PER>Harry</PER> in just over twelve hours, for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common room fire — assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately.
“Look, it’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t spotted <PER>Harry</PER> at once, as <PER>Hagrid</PER> was so large, but standing up carefully, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hagrid</PER> had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody.
As <PER>Harry</PER> watched, he saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Moody get up to leave.
<PER>Harry</PER> tapped <PER>Hagrid</PER> in the small of the back (being unable to reach <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder), muttered something to <PER>Harry</PER>, and then the pair of them made them's way back across the pub toward <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s table.
“All right, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> loudly.
Moody limped around the table and bent down; <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was reading the S.P.E.W.
notebook, until <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, “Nice cloak, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER> in amazement.
“And it’s come in useful at times, I can tell you.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> was beaming down at <PER>Harry</PER> too.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Hagrid</PER> couldn’t see him, but Moody had obviously told <PER>Hagrid</PER> he was there.
notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only <PER>Harry</PER> could hear it, “<PER>Harry</PER>, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin.
“Why does <PER>Hagrid</PER> want me to meet him at midnight?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, very surprised.
he was very curious to know what this might be; <PER>Hagrid</PER> had never asked <PER>Harry</PER> to visit <PER>Harry</PER> so late at night.
<PER>Harry</PER> crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> opened the Fat Lady for <PER>Harry</PER> from outside as they had planned.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was also lit up; <PER>Harry</PER> could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as Madame Maxime knocked on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s front door.
“You there, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> whispered, opening the door and looking around.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“What’re you showing me?” — <PER>Harry</PER> said warily, wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or <PER>Hagrid</PER> had managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a stranger in a pub.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried to follow and found, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s great surprise, that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, what — ?” “Shhh!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wands.
Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, <PER>Hagrid</PER> offered her his arm, and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime ’s giant winged horses, with <PER>Harry</PER>, totally bewildered, running to keep up with them.
Had <PER>Hagrid</PER> could see her any old time Had <PER>Hagrid</PER> wanted her wasn’t exactly hard to miss.
But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as <PER>Harry</PER>, because after a while she said playfully, “Wair is it you are taking me, ’Agrid?” “Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> gruffly, “worth seem’, trust me.
And still they walked, <PER>Harry</PER> getting more and more irritated as <PER>Harry</PER> jogged along in their wake, checking <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch every now and then.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurried up alongside them — for a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them — and then his mouth fell open.
Mesmerized, <PER>Harry</PER> looked up, high above <PER>Harry</PER>, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat’s, bulging with either fear or rage, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t tell which.
“Keep back there, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain <PER>Hagrid</PER>!
“Stunning Spells, on the count of three!” <PER>Harry</PER> saw each of the dragon keepers pull out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the ground with a thud that — <PER>Harry</PER> could have sworn made the trees behind — <PER>Harry</PER> quake.
The wizard who had warned <PER>Hagrid</PER> not to come any closer turned, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized who it was: Charlie Weasley.
Then he said, “How’s <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Fine,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; <PER>Harry</PER> had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t remember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than <PER>Harry</PER> did right now — when, without warning, <PER>Harry</PER> ran into something very solid.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell backward, <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses askew, clutching the cloak around <PER>Harry</PER>.
Very slowly and very carefully, <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and set off again as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back toward Hogwarts.
<PER>Harry</PER> had sneaked off <PER>Harry</PER>'s ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be.
<PER>Harry</PER> might even have spotted <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Madame Maxime heading off around the forest together — they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance and now all Karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would know what was in store for the champions.
<PER>Harry</PER> reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the marble stairs; <PER>Harry</PER> was very out of breath, but <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t dare slow down.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw <PER>Harry</PER> into an armchair in front of the fire.
“I’m — ” For a second, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to say “fine” — but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t do it.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was talking more than he’d talked in days — about how no one believed <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t entered the tournament of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own free will, how <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had lied about <PER>Harry</PER> in the Daily Prophet, how <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t walk down a corridor without being sneered at — and about <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER> not believing him, <PER>Ron</PER>’s jealousy " and now <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s just shown me what’s coming in the first task, and it’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a goner,” <PER>Harry</PER> finished desperately.
He had let <PER>Harry</PER> talk <PER>Harry</PER> into silence without interruption, but now <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Dragons we can deal with, <PER>Harry</PER>, but we’ll get to that in a minute — I haven’t got long here I’ve broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any time.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was a Death Eater.
“Exactly she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was rumored to be last and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?” “Yeah, but it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into <PER>Voldemort</PER>, is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, <PER>Ron</PER> stopped dead facing <PER>Harry</PER> across the room, and looked around.
He knew that <PER>Ron</PER> had no idea what He’d walked in on, knew He hadn’t done it on purpose, but He didn’t care — at this moment He hated everything about <PER>Ron</PER>, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath He's pajama trousers.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before <PER>Harry</PER> realized <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to pull <PER>Harry</PER>'s hat onto his foot instead of <PER>Harry</PER>'s sock.
When <PER>Harry</PER>’d finally got all <PER>Harry</PER>'s clothes on the right parts of <PER>Harry</PER>'s body, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried off to find <PER>Hermione</PER>, locating <PER>Hermione</PER>'s at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where <PER>Hermione</PER> was eating breakfast with <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Feeling too queasy to eat, <PER>Harry</PER> waited until <PER>Hermione</PER> had swallowed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s last spoonful of porridge, then dragged <PER>Hermione</PER>'s out onto the grounds.
There, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>'s all about the dragons, and about everything Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake.
Here, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled down every book <PER>Harry</PER> could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching through the large pile.
“Come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, we’ll go back to the common room <PER>Harry</PER>'s fan club’ll be here in a moment, twittering away.
When <PER>Harry</PER> awoke on Monday morning, <PER>Harry</PER> seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts.
But as <PER>Harry</PER> looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would mean, <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t do it.
It was the only place <PER>Harry</PER> had ever been happy well, <PER>Harry</PER> supposed <PER>Harry</PER> must have been happy with <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents too, but <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t remember that.
Somehow, the knowledge that <PER>Harry</PER> would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with <PER>Dudley</PER> was good to know; it made <PER>Harry</PER> feel slightly calmer.
<PER>Harry</PER> finished <PER>Harry</PER>'s bacon with difficulty (He throat wasn’t working too well), and as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> got up, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff table.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, I’ll see you in the greenhouses,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, coming to <PER>Harry</PER>'s decision as <PER>Harry</PER> watched Cedric leaving the Hall.
“Go on, I’ll catch you up.” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring — ” “I’ll catch you up, okay?” By the time <PER>Harry</PER> reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric was at the top.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s article at him every time him went near them.
Pausing at a distance from them, <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and took careful aim.
He stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> in disbelief.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure Cedric wouldn’t have asked that if <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the dragons himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have let <PER>Harry</PER>'s worst enemy face those monsters unprepared — well, perhaps <PER>Malfoy</PER> or <PER>Snape</PER> “It’s just fair, isn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to Cedric.
“We all know now we’re on an even footing, aren’t we?” Cedric was still looking at Cedric in a slightly suspicious way when <PER>Harry</PER> heard a familiar clunking noise behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
Would Moody go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and tell on <PER>Hagrid</PER>, or just turn <PER>Harry</PER> into a ferret?
Well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, <PER>Harry</PER> thought dully, <PER>Harry</PER>’d be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet <PER>Harry</PER> followed Moody into <PER>Harry</PER>'s office.
Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the reaction <PER>Harry</PER> had expected at all.
Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that <PER>Harry</PER> supposed Moody had used in the days when <PER>Harry</PER> had been an Auror.
On his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked, glass spinning top; <PER>Harry</PER> recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because <PER>Harry</PER> owned one his, though it was much smaller than Moody’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered what was in there, until Moody’s next question brought <PER>Harry</PER> sharply back to earth.
He’d been afraid of this — but <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t told Cedric, and <PER>Harry</PER> certainly wasn’t going to tell Moody, that <PER>Hagrid</PER> had broken the rules.
“You’re a damn good flier from what I’ve heard.” “Yeah, but ” <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m not allowed a broom, I’ve only got my wand — ” “My second piece of general advice,” said Moody loudly, interrupting Moody, “is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> blankly.
And for his Firebolt, his needed — “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, when <PER>Harry</PER> had sped into greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as <PER>Harry</PER> passed her.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> — I need you to help me.” “What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
they didn’t have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where <PER>Harry</PER> tried with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might to make various objects fly across the room toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, that’s good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper getting the better of <PER>Harry</PER>, “just as long as it’s not drawn-out.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty.
At two o’clock in the morning, <PER>Harry</PER> stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and <PER>Neville</PER>’s toad, Trevor.
“That’s better, <PER>Harry</PER>, that’s loads better,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, looking exhausted but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, throwing a rune dictionary back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, so <PER>Harry</PER> could try again, “threaten me with a dragon.
“Accio Dictionary !” The heavy book soared out of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s hand, flew across the room, and <PER>Harry</PER> caught it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I really think you’ve got it!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> delightedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt oddly separate from everyone around <PER>Harry</PER>, whether they were wishing <PER>Harry</PER> good luck or hissing “ We’ll have a box of tissues ready, Potted as he passed.
“Good luck, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered.
“Yes, I’m fine.” She was leading <PER>Harry</PER> toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when the dragons approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.
When <PER>Harry</PER> entered, Cedric gave <PER>Harry</PER> a small smile, which <PER>Harry</PER> returned, feeling the muscles in <PER>Harry</PER>'s face working rather hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it.
Knowing what was left, <PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four.
“No, I’m fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wondering why <PER>Harry</PER> kept telling people this, and wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> had ever been less fine.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to wish <PER>Harry</PER> luck as <PER>Harry</PER> walked past, but all that came out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.
Horrible pictures formed in <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind as he heard: “Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” “He’s taking risks, this one!” “Clever move — pity it didn’t work!” And then, after about fifteen minutes, <PER>Harry</PER> heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past Cedric's dragon and captured the golden egg.
“Miss Delacour, if you please!” Fleur was trembling from head to foot; <PER>Harry</PER> felt more warmly toward her than <PER>Harry</PER> had done so far as her left the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt much more aware of <PER>Harry</PER>'s body than usual; very aware of the way <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was pumping fast, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers tingling with fear yet at the same time, <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to be outside <PER>Harry</PER>, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away.
It was time to do what <PER>Harry</PER> had to do to focus <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited, every fiber of <PER>Harry</PER> hoping, praying.
If it hadn’t worked if it wasn’t coming <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to be looking at everything around <PER>Harry</PER> through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around <PER>Harry</PER> swim strangely.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> heard it, speeding through the air behind <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> turned and saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt hurtling toward <PER>Harry</PER> around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside <PER>Harry</PER>, waiting for <PER>Harry</PER> to mount.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground.
“Are you watching this, Mister Krum?” <PER>Harry</PER> soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following Mister Krum?”'s progress; its head revolving on its long neck — if Mister Krum?” kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy — but better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again — <PER>Harry</PER> plummeted just as the Horntail opened the Horntail mouth, but this time — <PER>Harry</PER> was less lucky — — <PER>Harry</PER> missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet — <PER>Harry</PER> instead, and as — <PER>Harry</PER> swerved to the left, one of the long spikes grazed — <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, ripping — <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes — — <PER>Harry</PER> could feel it stinging, — <PER>Harry</PER> could hear screaming and groans from the crowd, but the cut didn’t seem to be deep.
Now — <PER>Harry</PER> zoomed around the back of the Horntail, and a possibility occurred to — <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was like a fly to her, a fly her was longing to swat; her tail thrashed again, but <PER>Harry</PER> was too high to reach now.
“Come on,” <PER>Harry</PER> hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her, “come on, come and get me up you get now ” And then her reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings at last, as wide as those of a small airplane — and <PER>Harry</PER> dived.
He got to He's feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before He’d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside — <PER>Hermione</PER>, followed closely by <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you were brilliant!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said squeakily.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, very seriously, “whoever put your name in that goblet — I — I reckon they’re trying to do you in!” It was as though the last few weeks had never happened — as though <PER>Harry</PER> were meeting <PER>Ron</PER> for the first time, right after he’d been made champion.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> was about to apologize and suddenly <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need to hear it.
“Forget it.” “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “I shouldn’t’ve — ” “ Forget it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
<PER>Ron</PER> grinned nervously at <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> grinned back.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, c’mon, <PER>Harry</PER>, c’mon’ll be putting up your scores.
“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER>, squinting up the field, saw the first judge — Madame Maxime — raise her wand in the air.
“Looking good!” <PER>Ron</PER> yelled, thumping <PER>Harry</PER> on the back.
He grinned at <PER>Harry</PER> when He saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Good one, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “And you,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning back.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was wearing acid-green robes today; the Quick-Quotes Quill in <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's hand blended perfectly against them.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that <PER>Harry</PER> could send Sirius a letter telling <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to get past <PER>Harry</PER>'s dragon unscathed.
On the way, <PER>Harry</PER> filled <PER>Ron</PER> in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff.
“Remember what <PER>Malfoy</PER> said on the train, about <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s dad being friends with Karkaroff?
<PER>Ron</PER> snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while <PER>Harry</PER> attached the letter to <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded <PER>Hermione</PER>'s arms, and frowned at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s got a long way to go before <PER>Harry</PER> finishes this tournament,” she said seriously.
They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “Well, we’d better get downstairs for your surprise party, <PER>Harry</PER> — Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now.” Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again.
<PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to food; <PER>Harry</PER> had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe how happy <PER>Harry</PER> felt; <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Ron</PER> back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s side, He’d gotten through the first task, and <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have to face the second one for three months.
“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which <PER>Harry</PER> had left on a table, and weighing it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
Lee passed <PER>Harry</PER> the egg, and <PER>Harry</PER> dug <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed — ” Within a minute, however, <PER>Neville</PER> had molted, and once <PER>Neville</PER>'s feathers had fallen off, <PER>Neville</PER> reappeared looking entirely normal.
“George and I invented them — seven Sickles each, a bargain!” It was nearly one in the morning when <PER>Harry</PER> finally went up to the dormitory with <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, Seamus, and Dean.
Before he pulled the curtains of his four- poster shut, <PER>Harry</PER> set <PER>Harry</PER>'s tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed it eyes.
Really, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the hangings on <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster closed, <PER>Hagrid</PER> had a point they were all right, really, dragons.
Drafty though the castle always was in winter, <PER>Harry</PER> was glad of its fires and thick walls every time <PER>Harry</PER> passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing against the dark skies.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime’s horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the corner of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed.
Most of the class — <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead — had fled into <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Don’ frighten him, now!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> shouted as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back.
“Jus’ try an’ slip the rope ’round his sting, so his won’ hurt any o’ the others!” “Yeah, we wouldn’t want that!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted angrily as he and <PER>Harry</PER> backed into the wall of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks.
“Well, well, well this does look like fun.” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was leaning on <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s garden fence, looking in at the mayhem.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's crocodile-skin handbag was over <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's arm.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby.
“Who ’re you?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> asked <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt’s sting and tightened it.
“<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,” <PER>Rita</PER> replied, beaming at him.
“Thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said you weren’ allowed inside the school anymore,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, frowning slightly as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.
<PER>Rita</PER> acted as though she hadn’t heard what <PER>Hagrid</PER> had said.
“I’ve never heard of them before where do them come from?” <PER>Harry</PER> noticed a dull red flush rising up out of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s wild black beard, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart sank.
“Ah, you’re here, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter as <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter looked around.
“Er — yeah, why not?” <PER>Harry</PER> had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to <PER>Hagrid</PER> without <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter seeing, so <PER>Harry</PER> had to stand and watch in silence as <PER>Hagrid</PER> and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week.
“Well, good-bye, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Until Friday night, then, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” “Shell twist everything he says,” <PER>Harry</PER> said under his breath.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s been in loads of trouble before, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s never sacked him,” said <PER>Ron</PER> consolingly.
<PER>Harry</PER> thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again.
<PER>Harry</PER> fought hard to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s face straight.
<PER>Ron</PER> hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in whispers with <PER>Harry</PER> whether <PER>Harry</PER> should ask for an autograph — but then <PER>Ron</PER> realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.
“Wonder where she’s got to?” <PER>Ron</PER> said as he and <PER>Harry</PER> went back to Gryffindor Tower.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve got to come — you’ve got to come, the most amazing thing’s happened — please — ” the Fat Lady seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm and started to try to drag <PER>Harry</PER> back along the corridor.
“I’ll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>; quick <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>, intrigued.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, where are we going?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, after <PER>Hermione</PER> had led them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and <PER>Harry</PER>’s names.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed <PER>Hermione</PER> down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, they found they in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food.
He nudged <PER>Ron</PER> and pointed to the painting just behind <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, cottoning on.
“And it’s not spew, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “Changed the name, have you?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, frowning at her.
“I came down here just now, to talk to them all, and I found — oh come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, I want to show you!” She seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm again, pulled <PER>Harry</PER> in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl, stretched out Shis forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear.
<PER>Hermione</PER> seized It, pulled the door open, and pushed <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the back, forcing <PER>Harry</PER> inside.
<PER>Harry</PER> had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high- ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward <PER>Harry</PER> from the middle of the room, squealing, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir!
“Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter has come to see him, sir!” Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at <PER>Harry</PER>, Dobby's enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness.
One of these, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, was the black one <PER>Harry</PER> had removed from <PER>Harry</PER>'s own foot and tricked Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!” “Winky?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“She’s here too?” “Yes, sir, yes!” said Dobby, and sir seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there.
Each of these tables, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed as <PER>Harry</PER> passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the Great Hall.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had followed <PER>Harry</PER> and Dobby to the end of the kitchen.
Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, said, “Good for you, Dobby!” “Thank you, miss!” said Dobby, grinning toothily at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hastily dropped down to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knees beside <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and tried to comfort <PER>Hermione</PER>, but nothing <PER>Hermione</PER> said made the slightest difference.
“And Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying!
“Dobby likes Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for his.” “But you can say what you like about the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s now?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“Dobby could tell <PER>Harry</PER> Potter that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards'.” Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror- struck by Dobby's own daring — then Dobby rushed over to the nearest table and began banging Dobby's head on it very hard, squealing, “ Bad Dobby !
“You is seeing Mister Crouch here at Hogwarts?” “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “he and Mister Bagman are judges in the Tri-wizard Tournament.” “Mister Bagman comes too?” squeaked Winky, and to <PER>Harry</PER>’s great surprise (and <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again.
“Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!
<PER>Hermione</PER> refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies.
“You know what?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, once he, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again.
“Oh shell cheer up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> sounded a bit doubtful.
“Once the shock’s worn off, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s got used to Hogwarts, <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll see how much better off <PER>Hermione</PER> is without that Crouch man.” “she seems to love him,” said <PER>Ron</PER> thickly (him had just started on a cream cake) .
“Wonder what Crouch says at home about Crouch?” “Probably says Crouch’s not a very good Head of Department,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “and let’s face it Crouch’s got a point, hasn’t Crouch?” “I’d still rather work for Crouch than old Crouch,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s desk (<PER>Neville</PER>’s still had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the blackboard (“Describe, with examples, the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross-Species Switches”).
The bell was due to ring at any moment, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George’s fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, <PER>Ron</PER> holding a tin parrot and <PER>Harry</PER>, a rubber haddock.
“Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act Potter and Weasley's age,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of <PER>Harry</PER>’s haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor — <PER>Ron</PER>’s parrot’s beak had severed <PER>Ron</PER>’s parrot’s beak moments before — “I have something to say to you all.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> ignored them, which <PER>Harry</PER> thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see what was funny this time: Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as though her had never let her hair down in any sense.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then said, “Potter, the champions and their partners — ” “What partners?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked suspiciously at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, as though she thought Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was trying to be funny.
“Dance partners?” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> going red.
But now that <PER>Harry</PER> had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER>’d rather have another round with the dragon.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never known so many people to put so many people's names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; <PER>Harry</PER> always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but <PER>Harry</PER> had always been very much in the minority before now.
This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> to be obsessed with the coming ball — or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; <PER>Harry</PER> had never quite noticed that before.
“Why do they have to move in packs?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well whom <PER>Harry</PER>’d like to ask, but working up the nerve was something else.
<PER>Cho</PER> was a year older than <PER>Cho</PER> was; <PER>Cho</PER> was very pretty; <PER>Cho</PER> was a very good Quidditch player, and <PER>Cho</PER> was also very popular.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed to know what was going on inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
Moreover, to <PER>Harry</PER>’s amazement, <PER>Harry</PER>’s turned out to be quite right.
A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom <PER>Harry</PER> had never spoken in his life asked <PER>Harry</PER> to go to the ball with A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom <PER>Harry</PER> had never spoken in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ['s] the very next day.
<PER>Harry</PER> was so taken aback <PER>Harry</PER> said no before he’d even stopped to consider the matter.
The girl walked off looking rather hurt, and <PER>Harry</PER> had to endure Dean’s, Seamus’s, and <PER>Ron</PER>’s taunts about her all through History of Magic.
The following day, two more girls asked <PER>Harry</PER>, a second year and (to <PER>Harry</PER>'s horror) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if him refused.
“They only like him because him’s famous!” <PER>Harry</PER> doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be <PER>Harry</PER>'s partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with <PER>Harry</PER> if <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t been a school champion.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> wondered if this would bother him if <PER>Cho</PER> asked him.
On the whole, <PER>Harry</PER> had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before <PER>Harry</PER>, life had definitely improved since <PER>Harry</PER> had got through the first task.
<PER>Harry</PER> wasn’t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which <PER>Harry</PER> suspected had a lot to do with Cedric — <PER>Harry</PER> had an idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave <PER>Harry</PER> alone, in gratitude for <PER>Harry</PER>’s tip-off about the dragons.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, of course, was still quoting <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s article to <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> at every possible opportunity, but <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it — and just to heighten <PER>Harry</PER>’s feeling of well-being, no story about <PER>Hagrid</PER> had appeared in the Daily Prophet “She didn’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> asked him how him's interview with <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term.
“She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> continued in a low voice.
“yeh can’t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get boring.” “yeh wants a new angle, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> wisely as he shelled salamander eggs.
“You were supposed to say <PER>Harry</PER>’s a mad delinquent!” “But <PER>Harry</PER>’s not!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking genuinely shocked.
“She should’ve interviewed <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grimly.
“Well, yeh might’ve bent a few rules, <PER>Harry</PER>, bu’ yeh’re all righ’ really, aren’ you?” “Cheers, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning.
“You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t believe half of them — for instance, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta.
Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know, never having had access to a wizard’s wireless, but <PER>Harry</PER> deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group.
Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when them's minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to <PER>Harry</PER> about the perfect Summoning Charm <PER>Harry</PER> had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament.
Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Moody kept them working until the very last second of them's classes too, and <PER>Snape</PER>, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s Christmas, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> lazily; <PER>Harry</PER> was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire.
“I’d have thought you’d be doing something constructive, <PER>Harry</PER>, even if you don’t want to learn your antidotes!” “Like what?” <PER>Harry</PER> said as <PER>Harry</PER> watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser.
“Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’ve got till February the twenty- fourth,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
<PER>Harry</PER> had put the golden egg upstairs in <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and hadn’t opened the golden egg since the celebration party after the first task.
“You’re going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don’t!” “Leave him alone, <PER>Hermione</PER>, him’s earned a bit of a break,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and him placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing him's eyebrows.
They sat down at the table with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> felt how much damage had been done.
“There you go,” said Fred to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, “piece of cake.” He got to He's feet, yawning, and said, “We’d better use a school owl then, George, come on.
<PER>Ron</PER> stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“So basically, you’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have you, even if <PER>Hermione</PER>’s completely horrible?” “Er — yeah, that sounds about right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I’m going to bed,” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped, and <PER>Hermione</PER> swept off toward the girls’ staircase without another word.
When the decorations went up, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that the decorations were the most stunning <PER>Harry</PER> had yet seen inside the school.
And still, <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t asked <PER>Cho</PER> to the ball.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were getting very nervous now, though as <PER>Harry</PER> pointed out, <PER>Ron</PER> would look much less stupid than he would without a partner; <PER>Harry</PER> was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — we’ve just got to grit we teeth and do it,” said <PER>Ron</PER> on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress.
“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and he dashed off upstairs.
<PER>Cho</PER> hurried off through the packed corridors looking for <PER>Cho</PER>, and (rather sooner than <PER>Cho</PER> had expected) <PER>Cho</PER> found <PER>Cho</PER>, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.
— <PER>Cho</PER> said, “Okay,” and followed him out of earshot of — <PER>Cho</PER>'s classmates.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to look at her and <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach gave a weird lurch as though <PER>Harry</PER> had missed a step going downstairs.
<PER>Cho</PER> stood there looking puzzled, watching <PER>Cho</PER>.
The words came out before <PER>Harry</PER> had quite got <PER>Harry</PER>'s tongue around them.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m really sorry,” and <PER>Cho</PER> truly looked it.
They stood there looking at each other, and then <PER>Cho</PER> said, “Well — ” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> called after <PER>Cho</PER>, before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
Entering the common room, <PER>Harry</PER> looked around, and to <PER>Harry</PER>'s surprise <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> sitting ashen-faced in a distant corner.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was sitting with <PER>Harry</PER>, talking to <PER>Harry</PER> in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.
“What’s up, <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, joining them.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked up at <PER>Harry</PER>, a sort of blind horror in his face.
<PER>Ginny</PER> looked as though <PER>Ginny</PER> was fighting back a smile, but <PER>Ginny</PER> kept patting <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm sympathetically.
“I asked her to go with me just now,” <PER>Harry</PER> said dully, “and her told me.” <PER>Ginny</PER> had suddenly stopped smiling.
That shut <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> up.
“Thanks a bunch, <PER>Ginny</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sourly.
“All the good-looking ones taken, <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> loftily.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>’s right — you are a girl.
“Oh come on,” he said impatiently, “we need partners, we’re going to look really stupid if we haven’t got any, everyone else has ” “I can’t come with you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now blushing, “because I’m already going with someone.” “No, you’re not!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You just said that to get rid of <PER>Neville</PER>!” “Oh did I?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes flashed dangerously.
“Just because it’s taken you three years to notice, <PER>Ron</PER>, doesn’t mean no one else has spotted I’m a girl!” <PER>Ron</PER> stared at her.
<PER>Ron</PER> goggled at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> waited for them to subside, <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers crossed in the pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with <PER>Ron</PER>?” he said, lowering his voice so that <PER>Ron</PER> wouldn’t hear.
Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays, <PER>Harry</PER> was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying <PER>Harry</PER> as fully as possible along with everyone else.
<PER>Harry</PER> still hadn’t forgotten <PER>Dudley</PER> and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.
“It is too ’eavy, all zis ’Ogwarts food,” they heard her saying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening (<PER>Ron</PER> skulking behind <PER>Harry</PER>, keen not to be spotted by Fleur).
“She really thinks a lot of She, that one, doesn’t She?” “<PER>Hermione</PER> — who are you going to the ball with?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, <PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> scathingly, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> went up the marble staircase laughing heartily.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>, suddenly frowning, “your teeth ” “What about them?” <PER>Hermione</PER> said.
“Here — take it, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> added in an undertone as the third-year girls scuttled away looking scandalized.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow, and <PER>Harry</PER> read out: Dear <PER>Harry</PER>, Congratulations on getting past the Horntail.
Sirius “He sounds exactly like Moody,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, tucking the letter away again inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Want a game of chess, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yeah, okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Wondering what had caused <PER>Harry</PER>'s abrupt return to consciousness, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, and saw something with very large, round, green eyes staring back at <PER>Harry</PER> in the darkness, so close they were almost nose to nose.
“Dobbyl” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast <PER>Harry</PER> almost fell out of bed.
His yell had awoken <PER>Ron</PER>, Seamus, Dean, and <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, Dean, and <PER>Neville</PER> decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present-opening too.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed, still looking worried that <PER>Harry</PER> had upset <PER>Harry</PER>.
The reason they were extra-knobbly was that <PER>Harry</PER> had been using they to cushion <PER>Harry</PER>'s Sneakoscope for over a year now.
“Dobby knew Sir must be a great wizard, for Sir is <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that Dobby was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless — ” “They’re only socks,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same.
“Wow, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Harry</PER> — ” had just opened <PER>Harry</PER>’s present, a Chudley Cannon hat.
“Cool!” <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Harry</PER> — ” jammed it onto <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Harry</PER> — ”'s head, where it clashed horribly with <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Harry</PER> — ”'s hair.
“They’re They’re really well, thanks, Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness again.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby’s odd socks — with the obvious exception of the Dursleys’, which consisted of a single tissue, an all-time low — <PER>Harry</PER> supposed they too were remembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland ; <PER>Ron</PER>, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, a vast box of sweets including all <PER>Harry</PER>’s favorites: Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frogs, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> met up with <PER>Hermione</PER> in the common room, and they went down to breakfast together.
<PER>Hermione</PER> chose to watch <PER>Harry</PER> and the Weasleys’ snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o’clock said <PER>Hermione</PER> was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.
“Who ’re you going with?” he yelled after <PER>Hermione</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, Seamus, Dean, and <PER>Neville</PER> changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as <PER>Ron</PER>, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on himself's face.
“Shall we go down then, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> could just stay in the common room.
Fred winked at <PER>Harry</PER> as Fred passed <PER>Harry</PER> on the way out of the portrait hole.
Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led her over to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was in front; <PER>Malfoy</PER> was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar, which in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion made <PER>Malfoy</PER> look like a vicar.
Then Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s voice called, “Champions over here, please!” Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and <PER>Harry</PER> said “See you in a minute” to <PER>Ron</PER> and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let the chattering crowd through.
Cedric and <PER>Cho</PER> were close to <PER>Harry</PER> too; <PER>Harry</PER> looked away from Cedric and <PER>Cho</PER> so <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t have to talk to Cedric and <PER>Cho</PER><PER>Cho</PER>.
she was also smiling — rather nervously, it was true — but the reduction in the size of shis front teeth was more noticeable than ever; <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t understand how <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t spotted it before.
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, walked right past <PER>Hermione</PER> without looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> concentrated on not tripping over <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
Parvati seemed to be enjoying Parvati; Parvati was beaming around at everybody, steering <PER>Harry</PER> so forcefully that <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> were a show dog Parvati was putting through its paces.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of <PER>Ron</PER> and Padma as <PER>Harry</PER> neared the top table.
<PER>Ron</PER> was watching <PER>Hermione</PER> pass with narrowed eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like <PER>Ron</PER>’s as he watched Krum and <PER>Hermione</PER> draw nearer.
<PER>Harry</PER> took the hint and sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that <PER>Harry</PER> thought it ought to be fined.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked <PER>Harry</PER>'s up uncertainly and looked around — there were no waiters.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, however, looked carefully down at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own menu, then said very clearly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s plate, “Pork chops!” And pork chops appeared.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced up at <PER>Hermione</PER> to see how <PER>Hermione</PER> felt about this new and more complicated method of dining — surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house-elves?
<PER>Hermione</PER> was deep in talk with Viktor Krum and hardly seemed to notice what <PER>Hermione</PER> was eating.
It now occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had never actually heard Krum speak before, but <PER>Harry</PER> was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.
“Veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, I am thinking,” <PER>Harry</PER> was telling <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Percy frowned, but <PER>Harry</PER> could have sworn <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> a very small wink.
“Absolutely right,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly, slapping <PER>Harry</PER>'s own hand down on the table in imitation of Fleur.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> give a small wave, and looking around, saw Madame Maxime return it, Madame Maxime's opals glittering in the candlelight.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was now teaching Krum to say <PER>Hermione</PER>'s name properly; he kept calling <PER>Hermione</PER>'s “Hermy-own.” “Her-my-oh-nee,” Her said slowly and clearly.
“We’re supposed to dance!” <PER>Harry</PER> tripped over <PER>Harry</PER>'s dress robes as <PER>Harry</PER> stood up.
The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; <PER>Harry</PER> walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye (<PER>Harry</PER> could see Seamus and Dean waving at <PER>Harry</PER> and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention.
<PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> were dancing nearby — he could see <PER>Ginny</PER> wincing frequently as <PER>Neville</PER> trod on her feet — and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was waltzing with Madame Maxime.
“No, I don’t like it,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied, and <PER>Harry</PER> led her away from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where <PER>Ron</PER> and Padma were sitting.
“How’s it going?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who was now watching <PER>Cho</PER> and Cedric.
“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, fanning <PER>Hermione</PER> with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
“If you don’t know,” said <PER>Ron</PER> scathingly, “I’m not going to tell you.” <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at him, then at <PER>Harry</PER>, who shrugged.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, what — ?” “He’s from Durmstrang!” spat <PER>Ron</PER>.
“For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single thing about <PER>Harry</PER>, not one — ” <PER>Ron</PER> changed tack at the speed of light.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, “I haven’t got a problem with <PER>Hermione</PER> coming with Krum — ” But <PER>Ron</PER> ignored <PER>Harry</PER> too.
“No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, still glaring after <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Fine,” snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati and the Beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> could have sworn <PER>Harry</PER> had zoomed <PER>Harry</PER> there by a Summoning Charm.
The top table was now empty; Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>; Madame Maxime and <PER>Hagrid</PER> were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen.
When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.
Bagman opened his mouth to ask <PER>Harry</PER> something, but Percy diverted <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> had <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured.
“Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!” <PER>Snape</PER> snarled as a girl ran past <PER>Snape</PER>.
“And what are you two doing?” he added, catching sight of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> on the path ahead.
<PER>Harry</PER> hand went nervously to <PER>Harry</PER>'s goatee, and <PER>Harry</PER> began winding it around <PER>Harry</PER>'s finger.
“We’re walking,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Snape</PER> shortly.
“Not against the law, is it?” “Keep walking, then!” <PER>Snape</PER> snarled, and <PER>Snape</PER> brushed past them, <PER>Snape</PER>'s long black cloak billowing out behind <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> continued down the path.
“And since when have he and <PER>Snape</PER> been on first- name terms?” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly.
he and <PER>Snape</PER> had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which he and <PER>Snape</PER> could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain.
And then <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hagrid</PER> speak.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> froze.
<PER>Harry</PER> tapped <PER>Ron</PER> on the shoulder and jerked <PER>Harry</PER>'s head toward them, meaning that them could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to <PER>Harry</PER>), but <PER>Ron</PER>, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.
<PER>Harry</PER> definitely didn’t want to listen to this; <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Hagrid</PER> would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (<PER>Harry</PER> certainly would have) — if it had been possible <PER>Harry</PER> would have put <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn’t really an option.
Instead <PER>Harry</PER> tried to interest <PER>Harry</PER> in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer’s back, but the beetle just wasn’t interesting enough to block out <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s next words.
<PER>Harry</PER> could have told <PER>Hagrid</PER> it was best not to answer; <PER>Harry</PER> stood there in the shadows gritting <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth, hoping against hope <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t — but it was no good.
“C’mon,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, very quietly to <PER>Ron</PER>.
“What’s up?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, his expression very serious indeed.
“About <PER>Hagrid</PER> being half-giant?” “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, shrugging.
“So what?” <PER>Harry</PER> knew immediately, from the look <PER>Ron</PER> was giving him, that <PER>Harry</PER> was once again revealing him's ignorance of the wizarding world.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> returned to the Great Hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor.
“So?” <PER>Harry</PER> prompted <PER>Ron</PER>.
“There’s nothing wrong with <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” “I know there isn’t, but blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, shaking his head.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried not to watch <PER>Cho</PER> and Cedric too much; it gave <PER>Harry</PER> a strong desire to kick something.
Many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer, but <PER>Harry</PER> was perfectly happy to be going to bed; as far as <PER>Harry</PER> was concerned, the evening hadn’t been much fun.
Out in the entrance hall, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> saying good night to Krum before <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went back to the Durmstrang ship.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed her, but halfway up the staircase <PER>Harry</PER> heard someone calling him.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Cho</PER> waiting for <PER>Harry</PER> in the entrance hall below.
Was his trying to make <PER>Harry</PER> look like a fool, so <PER>Cho</PER> would like his even more by comparison?
<PER>Harry</PER> had to yell “Fairy lights!” before <PER>Harry</PER> woke them up, and when <PER>Harry</PER> did, them were extremely irritated.
<PER>Harry</PER> climbed into the common room and found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> having a blazing row.
“Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution is, don’t you?” yelled <PER>Hermione</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face was screwed up in anger.
“What’s that?” “Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!” <PER>Ron</PER> mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as <PER>Hermione</PER> turned on her heel and stormed up the girls’ staircase to bed.
<PER>Ron</PER> turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> liked being back on speaking terms with <PER>Ron</PER> too much to speak <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind right now — but <PER>Harry</PER> somehow thought that <PER>Hermione</PER> had gotten the point much better than <PER>Ron</PER> had.
<PER>Hermione</PER>’s hair was bushy again; <PER>Hermione</PER> confessed to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Hermione</PER> had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for the ball, “but it’s way too much bother to do every day,” she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> wasted no time in telling <PER>Hermione</PER> about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> didn’t seem to find the news that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was a half- giant nearly as shocking as <PER>Ron</PER> did.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that <PER>Harry</PER> was keen not to take <PER>Harry</PER>'s help if <PER>Harry</PER> could avoid it.
In any case, it seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> that if Cedric had really wanted to give <PER>Harry</PER> a hand, <PER>Harry</PER> would have been a lot more explicit.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task — and Cedric’s idea of a fair exchange had been to tell <PER>Harry</PER> to take a bath.
Well, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need that sort of rubbishy help — not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with <PER>Cho</PER>, anyway.
And so the first day of the new term arrived, and <PER>Harry</PER> set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach, as though <PER>Harry</PER> were carrying that around with <PER>Harry</PER> too.
Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures much in this weather, though as <PER>Ron</PER> said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin would catch fire.
“I am your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher.” “Where’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> repeated loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned; <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> and the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed her, looking back over their shoulders at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
“What’s wrong with <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, hurrying to catch up with Professor Grubbly-Plank.
The moment Professor Grubbly- Plank was out of earshot, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand inside the pocket of <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s robes and pulled out a folded page of newsprint.
Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, Special Correspondent.
Rubeus <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
While <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turns a blind eye, <PER>Hagrid</PER> has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being “very frightening.” “I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,” says <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, a fourth-year student.
“We all hate <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but we’re just too scared to say anything.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however.
In a bizarre twist, <PER>Hagrid</PER> is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know- Who’s fall from power — thereby driving <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s own mother, like the rest of You-Know- Who’s supporters, into hiding.
Perhaps <PER>Harry</PER> Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's large friend — but Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> surely has a duty to ensure that <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, along with Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants.
<PER>Harry</PER> finished reading and looked up at <PER>Ron</PER>, whose mouth was hanging open.
“What d’you mean, “we all hate <PER>Hagrid</PER>’?” <PER>Harry</PER> spat at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands as <PER>Harry</PER> turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.
<PER>Harry</PER> supposed that <PER>Harry</PER> ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but her seemed to have had a good time all the same.
“I didn’t know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni — ” “Look at this!” <PER>Harry</PER> snarled, and <PER>Harry</PER> shoved the Daily Prophet article under <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s nose.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s mouth fell open as <PER>Hermione</PER> read.
<PER>Hermione</PER> reaction was exactly the same as <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
“Anyway, she’s not supposed to come into school anymore, <PER>Hagrid</PER> said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> banned she.
“Sort of thing she’d do, isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.” “Like you and <PER>Ron</PER> did, you mean,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do want <PER>Hagrid</PER> back, of course I do!” <PER>Hermione</PER> added hastily, quailing under <PER>Harry</PER>’s furious stare.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, it’s us!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, pounding on the door.
“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to <PER>Harry</PER> whenever there was a teacher around, so that <PER>Harry</PER> was safe from <PER>Harry</PER>’s retaliation.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was very surprised that <PER>Harry</PER> was going to go.
“Well done!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but <PER>Harry</PER> ignored them.
<PER>Harry</PER> still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages whereas if <PER>Harry</PER> went into Hogsmeade, <PER>Harry</PER> might run into <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and get a chance to persuade <PER>Harry</PER> to come back.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the castle together on Saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates.
He hadn’t mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but <PER>Harry</PER> had found a miniature arm under <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes skinned for a sign of <PER>Hagrid</PER> all the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was not in any of the shops.
The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Hagrid</PER> wasn’t there.
Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, ordered three butter-beers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all.
<PER>Harry</PER> was looking strained again, quite as strained as <PER>Harry</PER> had that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared.
“In a moment, in a moment!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard him say brusquely to the goblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub toward <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s boyish grin back in place.
“You couldn’t give us a moment, you two, could you?” “Er — okay,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and he and <PER>Hermione</PER> went off to find a table.
“Really superb.” “Thanks,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew this couldn’t be all that Bagman wanted to say, because <PER>Harry</PER> could have congratulated <PER>Harry</PER> in front of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.
“Absolute nightmare,” said Bagman to <PER>Harry</PER> in an undertone, noticing <PER>Harry</PER> watching the goblins too.
“Listen, <PER>Harry</PER>,” he said (still in a very low voice), “I feel very bad about all this you were thrown into this tournament, you didn’t volunteer for it and if ” (his voice was so quiet now, <PER>Harry</PER> had to lean closer to listen) “if I can help at all a prod in the right direction I’ve taken a liking to you the way you got past that dragon!
“Well well, yes,” said Bagman impatiently, “but — come on, <PER>Harry</PER> — we all want a Hogwarts victory, don’t we?” “Have you offered Cedric help?” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“Can we buy you a drink?” “Er no,” said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at <PER>Harry</PER>, “no, thank you, boys ” Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER> had let <PER>Harry</PER> down badly.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to rejoin <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What did he want?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had sat down.
“Well, I don’t think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would like it if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, still looking deeply disapproving.
“Those goblins didn’t look very friendly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sipping <PER>Hermione</PER>'s butterbeer.
“Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it Crouch’ll be made head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation.” <PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Ron</PER> a don’t -joke-about-things-like- that look, and said, “Funny, goblins looking for Mister Crouch .
“Maybe they need an interpreter.” “Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was wearing banana-yellow robes today; <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's long nails were painted shocking pink, and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was accompanied by <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's paunchy photographer.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter bought drinks, and <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> glaring at Shis as She approached.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter ’s eyes widened behind <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken.
“What did you do that to <PER>Hagrid</PER> for, eh?” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter raised ” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter's heavily penciled eyebrows.
<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s smile flickered very slightly, but <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s hitched it back almost at once; <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s's Quick-Quotes Quill, and said, “How about giving me an interview about the <PER>Hagrid</PER> you know, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Let’s go,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “c’mon, <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Ron</PER> ” They left; many people were staring at They as many people went.
“She’ll be after you next, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street.
“I’m serious, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll dig up something on you — ” “My parents don’t read the Daily Prophet <PER>Hermione</PER> can’t scare me into hiding!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now striding along so fast that it was all <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> could do to keep up with <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The last time <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rage like this, she had hit <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> around the face.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> shouted, pounding on his front door.
<PER>Hermione</PER> said, “About t — !” and then stopped, very suddenly, because <PER>Hermione</PER> had found <PER>Hermione</PER> face-to-face, not with <PER>Hagrid</PER>, but with Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“We — er — we wanted to see <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rather small voice.
She, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon <PER>Harry</PER> the moment himself entered, barking madly and trying to lick himself's ears.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was sitting at <PER>Harry</PER>'s table, where there were two large mugs of tea.
“Hi, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“More tea, I think,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, closing the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes.
There was a slight pause, and then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, “Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> went slightly pink, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and continued, “<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> still seem to want to know you, judging by the way “<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> were attempting to break down the door.” “Of course we still want to know you!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, staring at <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea what you said, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.
“I just meant — <PER>Hagrid</PER>, how could you think we’d care what that — woman — wrote about you?” Two fat tears leaked out of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard.
“Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still looking carefully up at the ceiling.
“Not all of ’em wan’ me ter stay.” “Really, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now peering sternly over his half-moon spectacles.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, look what I’ve got for relatives!” <PER>Harry</PER> said furiously.
<PER>Hermione</PER> kept patting his arm, and at last, <PER>Hagrid</PER> looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, “Great man, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> great man ” “Yeah, he is,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Can I have one of these cakes, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” “Help yerself,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> went back to the castle later that afternoon with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, unable to banish the image of the happy expression on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s whiskery face as he had imagined <PER>Harry</PER> winning the tournament.
As <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea how long a bath <PER>Harry</PER> would need to work out the secret of the golden egg, <PER>Harry</PER> decided to do it at night, when <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to take as much time as <PER>Harry</PER> wanted.
Reluctant though <PER>Harry</PER> was to accept more favours from Cedric, <PER>Harry</PER> also decided to use the prefects’ bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in there, so it was much less likely that <PER>Harry</PER> would be disturbed.
<PER>Harry</PER> planned <PER>Harry</PER>'s excursion carefully, because <PER>Harry</PER> had been caught out of bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before, and had no desire to repeat the experience.
The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the cloak, was the most useful aid to rule-breaking <PER>Harry</PER> owned.
On Thursday night, <PER>Harry</PER> sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as <PER>Harry</PER> had done on the night when <PER>Hagrid</PER> had shown <PER>Harry</PER> the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open.
“Good luck,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered, climbing into the room as <PER>Harry</PER> crept out past <PER>Harry</PER>.
It was awkward moving under the cloak tonight, because <PER>Harry</PER> had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose with the other.
However, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the map at strategic intervals, <PER>Harry</PER> was able to ensure that <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t run into anyone <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to avoid.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with <PER>Harry</PER>'s gloves on the wrong hands, <PER>Harry</PER> located the right door, leaned close to the right door, and muttered the password, “Pine fresh,” just as Cedric had told <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped inside, bolted the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved forward, looking around, <PER>Harry</PER>'s footsteps echoing off the walls.
One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that <PER>Harry</PER> thought it would have supported <PER>Harry</PER>'s weight if <PER>Harry</PER>’d cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water.
<PER>Harry</PER> amused <PER>Harry</PER> for a while turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs.
Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a very short time considering its size, <PER>Harry</PER> turned off all the taps, pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water.
It was so deep that <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet barely touched the bottom, and <PER>Harry</PER> actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring at the egg.
Highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different- colored steam wafting all around <PER>Harry</PER>, no stroke of brilliance came to <PER>Harry</PER>, no sudden burst of understanding.
<PER>Harry</PER> stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms, lifted the egg in <PER>Harry</PER>'s wet hands, and opened his ['s].
“Myrtle!” <PER>Harry</PER> said in outrage, “I’m — I’m not wearing anything!” The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but <PER>Harry</PER> had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on <PER>Harry</PER> from out of one of the taps ever since <PER>Harry</PER> had arrived.
“You haven’t been to see me for ages.” “Yeah well ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, bending <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn’t see anything but <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, “I’m not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I?
“You used to be in there all the time.” This was true, though only because <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had found Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret — a forbidden potion that had turned him and <PER>Ron</PER> into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room.
“You keep your eyes shut!” <PER>Harry</PER> made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting <PER>Harry</PER> out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around <PER>Harry</PER>'s waist, and going to retrieve the egg.
Once <PER>Harry</PER> was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her fingers and said, “Go on, then open it under the water!” <PER>Harry</PER> lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened the egg and this time, it did not wail.
“Go on!” <PER>Harry</PER> took a great breath and slid under the surface — and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to <PER>Harry</PER> from the open egg in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands: “Come seek us where our voices sound, We cannot sing above the ground, And while you’re searching ponder this: We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss, An hour long you’ll have to look, And to recover what We took, But past an hour — the prospect’s black, Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.” <PER>Harry</PER> let <PER>Harry</PER> float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
It took three more underwater renditions of the egg’s song before <PER>Harry</PER> had it memorized; then <PER>Harry</PER> trod water for a while, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dudley</PER> had had lessons in his youth, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that <PER>Harry</PER> would drown one day, hadn’t bothered to give <PER>Harry</PER> any.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none of the other ghosts <PER>Harry</PER> knew made such a fuss about it.
“Er I’ll try,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, though privately thinking the only way <PER>Harry</PER>’d be visiting Myrtle’s bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked.
<PER>Harry</PER> had taken <PER>Harry</PER>'s first step back toward Gryffindor Tower when something else on the map caught <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye something distinctly odd.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, thinking and then <PER>Harry</PER>'s curiosity got the better of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas.
<PER>Harry</PER> crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take <PER>Harry</PER> down two floors.
And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mister Crouch, <PER>Harry</PER>’s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step <PER>Neville</PER> always forgot to jump.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late; the golden egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step — the Invisibility Cloak slipped <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> snatched at it, and the Marauder’s Map fluttered out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s knee, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t reach it.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was too far away to reach — Pulling the cloak back over <PER>Harry</PER> straightened up, listening hard with <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes screwed up with fear and, almost immediately — It was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wheezy voice raised in fury.
“You’ve been stealing!” He ripped back the tapestry below, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s horrible, pouchy face and bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase.
At the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make <PER>Harry</PER>’s situation worse: <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was wearing a long gray nightshirt and <PER>Harry</PER> looked livid.
<PER>Harry</PER> gritted <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth, convinced <PER>Harry</PER>'s loudly thumping heart would give <PER>Harry</PER> away at any second.
“I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break!” <PER>Snape</PER> looked up the stairs, straight through <PER>Harry</PER>, and then down into the corridor below.
Go, <PER>Harry</PER> pleaded with <PER>Harry</PER> silently, go with <PER>Snape</PER> go Mistress Norris was peering around Filch ’s legs.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct impression that Mistress Norris could smell <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual — and then Professor <PER>Snape</PER> discovered that someone had broken into Professor <PER>Snape</PER>'s off — ” “Shut up!” Professor <PER>Snape</PER> hissed to Filch.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Moody’s magical eye travel over <PER>Snape</PER>, and then, unmistakably, onto <PER>Harry</PER>.
Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks Moody alone could see the full strangeness of the scene: <PER>Snape</PER> in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, <PER>Harry</PER>, trapped in the stairs behind them.
“Did I hear that correctly, <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Snape</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> could see a vein flickering horribly on <PER>Snape</PER> ’s greasy temple.
“Not hiding anything else in your office, are you?” <PER>Harry</PER> saw the edge of <PER>Snape</PER> ’s sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein in <PER>Harry</PER>'s temple pulsing more rapidly.
“Get back to bed, <PER>Snape</PER>.” “You don’t have the authority to send me anywhere!” <PER>Snape</PER> hissed, letting go of <PER>Snape</PER>'s arm as though angry with himself.
As <PER>Snape</PER> and Filch both turned to look at it, <PER>Harry</PER> threw caution to the winds; <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms under the cloak and waved furiously at Moody to attract <PER>Harry</PER>'s attention, mouthing “It’s mine!
“It’s mine — must’ve dropped it earlier — ” But <PER>Snape</PER> ’s black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch’s arms to the map in Moody’s hand, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Harry</PER> was putting two and two together, as only <PER>Snape</PER> could.
“Potter!” <PER>Snape</PER> snarled, and <PER>Snape</PER> actually turned <PER>Snape</PER>'s head and stared right at the place where <PER>Harry</PER> was, as though <PER>Harry</PER> could suddenly see <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was looking down at Moody, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see the expression on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
Then <PER>Snape</PER> slowly lowered <PER>Snape</PER>'s hands.
Still breathing very fast, <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Snape</PER> walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mistress Norris.
<PER>Harry</PER> was left staring down at Moody, who placed <PER>Harry</PER>'s staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward <PER>Harry</PER>, a dull clunk on every other step.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, hoping Moody was going to pull <PER>Harry</PER> out of the staircase soon; <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg was really hurting <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Harry</PER> dared ask.
It was a penetrating glare, and <PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that Moody was sizing <PER>Harry</PER> up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered how much <PER>Harry</PER> dare say.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want Moody to guess that <PER>Harry</PER> had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky questions about Sirius.
Could Moody possibly mean what <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> meant?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart sank; <PER>Harry</PER>’s had thought this was coming.
Moody waved the map in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, who braced himself — “Can I borrow this?” “Oh!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very fond of <PER>Harry</PER>'s map, but on the other hand, <PER>Harry</PER> was extremely relieved that Moody wasn’t asking where He’d got it, and there was no doubt that Moody was owed Moody a favor.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about <PER>Snape</PER>, and Crouch, and what it all meant.
Interesting idea but somehow, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, as <PER>Harry</PER> got quietly into <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster ten minutes later, the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, his thought his’d like to check how scarred the rest of them were before his chose it as a career.
“I just need to — sort of fine-tune it, all right?” He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s aim was so poor that <PER>Neville</PER>’s kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room — Professor Flitwick, for instance.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been recounting <PER>Harry</PER>'s adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.
“<PER>Snape</PER> said Moody’s searched <PER>Snape</PER>'s office as well?” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered, his eyes alight with interest as his Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it soared into the air and knocked Parvati’s hat off).
“What d’you reckon Moody’s here to keep an eye on <PER>Snape</PER> as well as Karkaroff?” “Well, I dunno if that’s what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to do, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s definitely doing it,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, waving <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk.
“Moody said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> only lets <PER>Snape</PER> stay here because <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s giving him a second chance or something.
“<PER>Harry</PER> maybe Moody thinks <PER>Snape</PER> put your name in the Goblet of Fire!” “Oh <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shaking her head sceptically, “we thought <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to kill <PER>Harry</PER> before, and it turned out <PER>Harry</PER> was saving <PER>Harry</PER>’s life, remember?” She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, thinking it was true that <PER>Snape</PER> had saved <PER>Harry</PER>'s life once, but the odd thing was, <PER>Snape</PER> definitely loathed <PER>Harry</PER>, just as he’d loathed <PER>Harry</PER>’s father when they had been at school together.
<PER>Snape</PER> loved taking points from <PER>Harry</PER>, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give <PER>Snape</PER> punishments, or even to suggest that <PER>Snape</PER> should be suspended from the school.
“Come on, <PER>Hermione</PER>, why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office, then?” “Why has Mister Crouch been pretending to be ill?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You just want to think <PER>Snape</PER>’s up to something,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sending <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cushion zooming neatly into the box.
“I just want to know what <PER>Snape</PER> did with his first chance, if his’s on his second one,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grimly, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s cushion, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s very great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.
Obedient to Sirius’s wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER> sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mister Crouch breaking into <PER>Snape</PER>’s office, and Moody and <PER>Snape</PER>’s conversation.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing <PER>Harry</PER>: how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty- fourth of February.
<PER>Ron</PER> quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again — <PER>Harry</PER> had explained about Aqua- Lungs, and <PER>Ron</PER> couldn’t see why <PER>Harry</PER> shouldn’t Summon one from the nearest Muggle town.
<PER>Hermione</PER> squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that <PER>Harry</PER> managed to learn how to operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua- Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.
“No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm.” So <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking that So <PER>Harry</PER> would soon have had enough of the library to last <PER>Harry</PER> a lifetime, buried <PER>Harry</PER> once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen.
However, though he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends — though <PER>Harry</PER> asked Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help — they found nothing whatsoever that would enable <PER>Harry</PER> to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.
Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb <PER>Harry</PER> now, and <PER>Harry</PER> was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again.
The lake, which <PER>Harry</PER> had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes whenever <PER>Harry</PER> was near a classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the parchment, unrolled the parchment, and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Weekend after next,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had read the note over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“Come on Care of Magical Creatures.” Whether <PER>Hagrid</PER> was trying to make up for the Blast- Ended Skrewts, or because there were now only two skrewts left, or because Whether <PER>Hagrid</PER> <PER>Hagrid</PER> was trying to prove Whether <PER>Hagrid</PER> could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank could, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he’d returned to work.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees buckled under its weight, “I’d’ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on tha’ Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin’ yeh set yer mind ter.
yeh looked after everything else on the grounds, after all — “Yeh’re goin’ ter win,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> growled, patting <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder again, so that <PER>Harry</PER> actually felt <PER>Harry</PER> sink a couple of inches into the soft ground.
By the evening before the second task, <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> were trapped in a nightmare.
<PER>Harry</PER> was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, <PER>Harry</PER> managed to find a suitable spell, He’d have a real job mastering it overnight.
Why had <PER>Harry</PER> ever let <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater?
a teacher sat with <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the library as the sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s heart gave a huge leap every time <PER>Harry</PER> saw the word “water” on a page, but more often than not it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt ” “I don’t reckon it can be done,” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice flatly from the other side of the table.
“Be a talking point, wouldn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up.
“<PER>McGonagall</PER> wants you, <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, who felt his stomach drop.
Was Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> about to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> off?
“Well meet you back in the common room,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> as she got up to go with <PER>Ron</PER> — both of them looked very anxious.
People kept wishing <PER>Harry</PER> luck for the next morning in cheery, confident voices like <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, all of People apparently convinced that <PER>Harry</PER> was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one <PER>Harry</PER> had managed in the first task.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t answer them, <PER>Harry</PER> just nodded, feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
he had searched all the remaining books, and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had not come back.
He could almost hear Fleur Delacour saying “I knew Fleur Delacour ’e is too young, ’e is only a little boy.” He saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> flashing He's POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the crowd, saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s crestfallen, disbelieving face.
Forgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap, <PER>Harry</PER> stood up very suddenly; Crookshanks hissed angrily as <PER>Harry</PER> landed on the floor, gave <PER>Harry</PER> a disgusted look, and stalked away with <PER>Harry</PER>'s bottlebrush tail in the air, but <PER>Harry</PER> was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory .
<PER>Harry</PER> would grab the Invisibility Cloak and go back to the library, He’d stay there all night if <PER>Harry</PER> had to.
“Lumos,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered fifteen minutes later as <PER>Harry</PER> opened the library door.
<PER>Harry</PER> carried them over to a table, then set to work, searching them by the narrow beam of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, occasionally checking <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch.
<PER>Harry</PER> was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock, while her held <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt over his head.
“That hurts — get off — ouch — ” “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter must wake up, sir!” “Stop poking me — ” “Dobby must poke <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir, he must wake up!” <PER>Harry</PER> opened his eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off <PER>Harry</PER>'s head as he’d slept, and the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was stuck to the pages of Where There’s a Wand, There’s a Way.
“The second task starts in ten minutes, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter “Ten minutes?” <PER>Harry</PER> croaked.
A large, dead weight seemed to fall through <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest into <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
“Hurry, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” squeaked Dobby, plucking at <PER>Harry</PER>’s sleeve.
“Dobby knew <PER>Harry</PER> had not found the right book, so Dobby did the right book for <PER>Harry</PER>!” “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“They’ve got They’ve got <PER>Ron</PER>?” “The thing <PER>Harry</PER> Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked Dobby.
“It will make <PER>Harry</PER> Potter breathe underwater, sir!” “Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER> frantically, “listen — are you sure about this?” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to “help” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> had ended up with no bones in <PER>Harry</PER>'s right arm.
“Dobby will be missed — good luck, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir, good luck!” “See you later, Dobby!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, and <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time.
They stared as <PER>Harry</PER> flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as <PER>Harry</PER> leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly grounds.
“Let him catch him's breath!” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER>, but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime didn’t look at all pleased to see <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent over, hands on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, gasping for breath; <PER>Harry</PER> had a stitch in <PER>Harry</PER>'s side that felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> had a knife between <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs, but there was no time to get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions, spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> was on the very end of the line, next to Krum, who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand ready.
“All right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” Bagman whispered as he moved <PER>Harry</PER> a few feet farther away from Krum.
Bagman gave <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges’ table; <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at his throat as his had done at the World Cup, said, “Sonorusl” and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands.
Then, quite suddenly, <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth and nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to draw breath, but it made <PER>Harry</PER>'s head spin; <PER>Harry</PER>'s lungs were empty, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck — <PER>Harry</PER> clapped — <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands around — <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat and felt two large slits just below ] throat's ears, flapping in the cold air. ]
<PER>Harry</PER> struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast <PER>Harry</PER>'s flipper-like feet propelled <PER>Harry</PER> through The water, and noticing how clearly <PER>Harry</PER> could see, and how <PER>Harry</PER> no longer seemed to need to blink.
<PER>Harry</PER> had soon swum so far into the lake that <PER>Harry</PER> could no longer see the bottom.
Silence pressed upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears as <PER>Harry</PER> soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape.
<PER>Harry</PER> was staring unblinkingly ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to discern shapes through the gloom and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of <PER>Harry</PER>'s ankle.
<PER>Harry</PER> twisted <PER>Harry</PER>'s body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>’s leg, its pointed fangs bared — <PER>Harry</PER> stuck — <PER>Harry</PER>'s webbed hand quickly inside — <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and fumbled for his wand.
By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes, and were attempting to drag <PER>Harry</PER> down.
A large bubble issued from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on them's green skin.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder at random; every now and then <PER>Harry</PER> felt one of the grindylows snatch at <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot again, and <PER>Harry</PER> kicked out, hard; finally, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while the dazed grindylow fellows shook its fellows's fists at <PER>Harry</PER> and sank back into the weed.
<PER>Harry</PER> slowed down a little, slipped <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, and looked around, listening again.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing harder than ever against <PER>Harry</PER>'s eardrums.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> must be even deeper in the lake now, but nothing was moving but the rippling weed.
“How are you getting on?” <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was having a heart attack.
<PER>Harry</PER> whipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, gazing at <PER>Harry</PER> through her thick, pearly glasses.
“Myrtle!” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to shout — but once again, nothing came out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth but a very large bubble.
They leered at <PER>Harry</PER> as he swam past; one or two of They emerged from They's caves to watch <PER>Harry</PER> better, They's powerful, silver fish tails beating the water, spears clutched in They's hands.
<PER>Harry</PER> sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous; there were gardens of weed around some of them, and <PER>Harry</PER> even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door.
Merpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER>'s webbed hands and gills, talking behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s webbed hands and gills's hands to one another.
<PER>Harry</PER> sped around a corner and a very strange sight met <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Ron</PER> was tied between <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER> Chang.
<PER>Harry</PER> sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower the hostages's spears and charge at <PER>Harry</PER>, but the hostages did nothing.
“Come ON\” <PER>Harry</PER> said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth), and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked the spear back, still shaking his head and laughing.
He turned back to <PER>Hermione</PER>, raised the jagged rock, and began to hack at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bindings too — At once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him.
“Your task is to retrieve your own friend leave the others ” “She’s my friend too!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, gesturing toward <PER>Hermione</PER>, an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips.
“And I don’t want them to die either!” <PER>Cho</PER>’s head was on <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale.
<PER>Harry</PER> struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed harder than ever, holding <PER>Harry</PER> back.
Would he have time to take <PER>Ron</PER> to the surface and come back down for <PER>Hermione</PER> and the others?
There was an enormous bubble around <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, which made <PER>Harry</PER>'s features look oddly wide and stretched.
“Fleur and Krum’re coming now!” Feeling enormously relieved, <PER>Harry</PER> watched Cedric pull a knife out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and cut <PER>Cho</PER> free.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Cho</PER>'s upward and out of sight.
Those holding <PER>Harry</PER> loosened Those holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip, staring behind Those holding <PER>Harry</PER>.
The shark-man swam straight to <PER>Hermione</PER> and began snapping and biting at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s ropes; the trouble was that Krum’s new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure that if Krum wasn’t careful, <PER>Harry</PER> was going to rip <PER>Hermione</PER> in half.
Within seconds, he had done it; he grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> around the waist, and without a backward glance, began to rise rapidly with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s toward the surface.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“You’ve got until three!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted; a great stream of bubbles burst from <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> held up three fingers to make sure they got the message.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized the little girl around the waist, grabbed the neck of <PER>Ron</PER>’s robes, and kicked off from the bottom.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming; <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging <PER>Ron</PER> and the girl.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel pain on the sides of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck again <PER>Harry</PER> was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth yet the darkness was definitely thinning now <PER>Harry</PER> could see daylight above <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked hard with <PER>Harry</PER>'s flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feet water was flooding through <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth into <PER>Harry</PER>'s lungs He was starting to feel dizzy, but He knew light and air were only ten feet above He He had to get there He had to <PER>Harry</PER> kicked He's legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest; He's very brain felt waterlogged, He couldn’t breathe, He needed oxygen, He had to keep going, He could not stop — And then He felt He's head break the surface of the lake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making He's wet face sting; He gulped it down, feeling as though He had never breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled <PER>Ron</PER> and the little girl up with He.
The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be on their feet; <PER>Harry</PER> had the impression they thought that <PER>Ron</PER> and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong both of they had opened their eyes; the little girl looked scared and confused, but <PER>Ron</PER> merely expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, and said, “Wet, this, isn’t it?” Then he spotted Fleur’s sister.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you prat,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “you didn’t take that song thing seriously, did you?
It was all very well for <PER>Ron</PER>; he’d been asleep, <PER>Harry</PER> hadn’t felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear- carrying merpeople who’d looked more than capable of murder.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over <PER>Hermione</PER>, Krum, Cedric, and <PER>Cho</PER>, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> from the bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual, came splashing out to meet them.
Percy seized <PER>Ron</PER> and was dragging him back to the bank (“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Bagman were pulling <PER>Harry</PER> upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging Madame Maxime's sister.
Madam Pomfrey seized <PER>Harry</PER> and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> over to <PER>Hermione</PER> and the others, wrapped <PER>Harry</PER> so tightly in a blanket that <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, well done!” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have told her about Dobby, but <PER>Harry</PER> had just noticed Karkaroff watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Fleur’s sister had got back safely.
“Yeah, that’s right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that himself had just rescued her from the lake, but <PER>Hermione</PER> brushed away the beetle impatiently and said, “You’re well outside the time limit, though, <PER>Harry</PER> .
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water; clearly, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could speak Mermish.
Finally <PER>Dumbledore</PER> straightened up, turned to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fellow judges, and said, “A conference before we give the marks, I think.” his fellow judges went into a huddle.
Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue <PER>Ron</PER> from Percy’s clutches; Madam Pomfrey led him over to <PER>Harry</PER> and the others, gave him a blanket and some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister.
Fleur bent down, kissed <PER>Harry</PER> twice on each cheek (Fleur felt Fleur's face burn and wouldn’t have been surprised if steam was coming out of Fleur's ears again), then said to <PER>Ron</PER>, “And you too — you ’elped — ” “Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking extremely hopeful, “yeah, a bit — ” Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him.
“Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though his returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour.” Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Cho</PER> give Cedric a glowing look.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, caught by surprise, stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.
“There you go, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Ron</PER> shouted over the noise.
Fleur attempted to engage <PER>Hermione</PER> in conversation again, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was too busy cheering <PER>Harry</PER> to listen.
Next time he was in Hogsmeade, <PER>Harry</PER> decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle, <PER>Harry</PER> was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year.
One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that <PER>Ron</PER> was getting to share <PER>Harry</PER>’s limelight for once.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Ron</PER>’s version of events changed subtly with every retelling.
At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with <PER>Hermione</PER>’s story, anyway — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s office, first assuring all the hostages that all the hostages would be quite safe, and would awake when all the hostages were back above the water.
People had been teasing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would most miss that <PER>Hermione</PER> was in a rather tetchy mood.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s ears went red, and thereafter, <PER>Ron</PER>’s reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events.
The brown owl that <PER>Harry</PER> had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; <PER>Harry</PER> had no sooner torn off Sirius’s reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again.
“I can’t believe him,” said <PER>Harry</PER> tensely, “if he’s caught ” “Made it so far, though, hasn’t he?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
If <PER>Harry</PER> was honest with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> really wanted to see Sirius again.
<PER>Harry</PER> therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon — double Potions — feeling considerably more cheerful than <PER>Harry</PER> usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons.
Pansy’s pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle ’s broad back as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> approached.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual.
Once <PER>Snape</PER> had turned <PER>Snape</PER>'s back on them to write up the ingredients of today’s potion on the blackboard, <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned in closer.
A color photograph of <PER>Harry</PER> headed a short piece entitled: <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s Secret Heartache A boy like no other, perhaps — yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter.
Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteen-year-old <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thought fourteen-year-old <PER>Harry</PER> Potter had found solace in fourteen-year-old <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle- born <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger.
“I told you!” <PER>Ron</PER> hissed at <PER>Hermione</PER> as she stared down at the article.
“If that’s the best <PER>Rita</PER> can do, she’s losing shis touch,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, still giggling, as <PER>Hermione</PER> threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> started unpacking the ingredients they would need for them's Wit-Sharpening Potion.
“There’s something funny, though,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> ten minutes later, holding <PER>Hermione</PER>'s pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles.
“How could <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter have known ?” “Known what?” said <PER>Ron</PER> quickly.
“You haven’t been mixing up Love Potions, have you?” “Don’t be stupid,” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped, starting to pound up <PER>Hermione</PER>'s beetles again.
“No, it’s just how did <PER>Hermione</PER> know Viktor asked me to visit Viktor over the summer?” <PER>Hermione</PER> blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided <PER>Ron</PER>’s eyes.
“And he did say he’d never felt the same way about anyone else,” <PER>Hermione</PER> went on, going so red now that <PER>Harry</PER> could almost feel the heat coming from <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but how could <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter have heard <PER>Harry</PER>?
my class was now looking around at them; <PER>Malfoy</PER> took the opportunity to flash POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“A further ten points from Gryffindor oh but of course ” <PER>Snape</PER>’s black eyes glittered as they fell on <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s article.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s fury, <PER>Harry</PER> began to read the article aloud.
“ ‘ <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.’ How very touching,” sneered <PER>Snape</PER>, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins.
<PER>Snape</PER> followed, sat down at <PER>Snape</PER>'s desk and watched <PER>Harry</PER> unload his cauldron.
Determined not to look at <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> resumed the mashing of <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarab beetles, imagining each one to have <PER>Snape</PER>’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to provoke <PER>Snape</PER>; <PER>Snape</PER> had done this before.
“You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,” <PER>Snape</PER> went on, so quietly that no one else could hear <PER>Snape</PER> (<PER>Harry</PER> continued to pound <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarab beetles, even though <PER>Harry</PER> had already reduced them to a very fine powder), “but I don’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers.
His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but His kept His's eyes down, as though His couldn’t hear what <PER>Snape</PER> was saying to <PER>Snape</PER>.
“So I give you fair warning, Potter,” <PER>Snape</PER> continued in a softer and more dangerous voice, “pint-sized celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my office one more time — ” “I haven’t been anywhere near your office!” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, forgetting <PER>Harry</PER>'s feigned deafness.
“Don’t lie to me,” <PER>Snape</PER> hissed, <PER>Snape</PER>'s fathomless black eyes boring into <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year — they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion — and while <PER>Snape</PER> had suspected <PER>Harry</PER> at the time, <PER>Harry</PER> had never been able to prove it.
<PER>Snape</PER> plunged a hand into the inside of <PER>Snape</PER>'s black robes.
For one wild moment, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Snape</PER> was about to pull out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and curse <PER>Snape</PER> — then <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Snape</PER> had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion.
“Do you know what this is, Potter?” <PER>Snape</PER> said, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes glittering dangerously again.
He didn’t like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would He put it past <PER>Snape</PER> to slip <PER>Snape</PER> some.
He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of He's mouth if <PER>Snape</PER> did it quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble — <PER>Hermione</PER> and Dobby for a start — there were all the other things he was concealing like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius and — his insides squirmed at the thought — how he felt about <PER>Cho</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> was twisting <PER>Snape</PER>'s finger around <PER>Snape</PER>'s goatee and looking agitated.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>'s ginger roots, listening hard.
“I’ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,” <PER>Snape</PER> muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted <PER>Snape</PER>.
Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, <PER>Harry</PER> deliberately knocked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave <PER>Harry</PER> an excuse to duck down behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door.
“This,” said Karkaroff, and <PER>Harry</PER>, peering around the edge of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left- hand sleeve of his robe and show <PER>Snape</PER> something on <PER>Snape</PER>'s inner forearm.
Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER>'s books and ingredients back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and left at top speed to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> what he had just witnessed.
“Hello, Sirius,” said <PER>Harry</PER> when they had reached <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> climbed over the stile and followed.
It was easy for him, with him's four paws, but <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were soon out of breath.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself.
For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony path, following Sirius’s wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of <PER>Harry</PER>’s bag cutting into <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled open <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread.
<PER>Ron</PER> nudged <PER>Harry</PER> and passed him the Daily Prophets.
“I bet he wishes he hadn’t done it now — bet he feels the difference now she’s not there to look after he.” “<PER>Hermione</PER>’s obsessed with house-elfs,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered to Sirius, casting <PER>Hermione</PER> a dark look.
“Crouch sacked his house-elf?” “Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> launched into the story of the Dark Mark’s appearance, and Winky being found with <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand clutched in her hand, and Mister Crouch’s fury.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, Sirius was on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave.
Then he said, “<PER>Harry</PER>, did you check your pockets for your wand after you’d left the Top Box?” “Erm ” <PER>Harry</PER> thought hard.
“Some Bulgarian ministers <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s ” “The <PER>Malfoy</PER>s!” said <PER>Ron</PER> suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously.
“Remember?” she said to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Told you,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking meaningfully at Sirius, “told you <PER>Hermione</PER>’s obsessed with house — ” But Sirius held up a hand to silence <PER>Ron</PER>.
“When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, what did Crouch do?” “Went to look in the bushes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but there wasn’t anyone else there.” “Of course,” Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, “of course, he’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf and then he sacked her?” “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a heated voice, “he sacked <PER>Hermione</PER>, just because <PER>Hermione</PER> hadn’t stayed in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s tent and let <PER>Hermione</PER> get trampled — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, will you give it a rest with the elf!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
He suddenly looked as menacing as He had the night when <PER>Harry</PER> first met him, the night when <PER>Harry</PER> still believed Sirius to be a murderer.
“He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial.” “What?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn’t you know?” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> shook their heads.
<PER>Harry</PER> was thinking of the way Crouch’s eyes had bulged as he’d looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s disobedient house-elf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup.
“If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater.” “And he sneaked up here to search <PER>Snape</PER>’s office!” said <PER>Ron</PER> triumphantly, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Look, I don’t care what you say, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts <PER>Snape</PER> — ” “Oh give it a rest, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> impatiently.
“I know <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s brilliant and everything, but that doesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn’t fool <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s — ” “Why did <PER>Snape</PER> save <PER>Harry</PER>’s life in the first year, then?
“I think they’ve both got a point,” said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Ever since I found out <PER>Snape</PER> was teaching here, I’ve wondered why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hired <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> knew more curses when <PER>Snape</PER> arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and <PER>Snape</PER> was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.” Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names.
“Yeah, you should’ve seen <PER>Snape</PER>’s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“Karkaroff wanted to talk to <PER>Snape</PER>, Karkaroff says <PER>Snape</PER>’s been avoiding him.
“There’s still the fact that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts <PER>Snape</PER>, and I know <PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts where a lot of other people wouldn’t, but I just can’t see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> letting <PER>Snape</PER> teach at Hogwarts if <PER>Snape</PER>’d ever worked for <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” “Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into <PER>Snape</PER> ’s office then?” said <PER>Ron</PER> stubbornly.
“What’s the time?” <PER>Harry</PER> checked <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch, then remembered it hadn’t been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is too good to Dobby!” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter squeaked, wiping large tears out of <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's enormous eyes.
“Oh dear,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> as <PER>Hermione</PER> spotted Winky.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is brave and noble and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter is not nosy!” “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter is nosing — hie — into my master’s — hie — private and secret — hie — Winky is a good house-elf — hie — Winky keeps her silence — hie — people trying to — hie — pry and poke — hie — ” Winky’s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off shis stool into the hearth, snoring loudly.
They were suddenly looking at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though <PER>Hermione</PER> were mad and dangerous.
“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at <PER>Harry</PER>’s elbow, and <PER>Harry</PER> shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into <PER>Harry</PER>’s arms.
“Good-bye!” The house-elves crowded around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of them's backs.
“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them.
<PER>Harry</PER> got so tired of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that <PER>Harry</PER> took Sirius’s food up to the Owlery that evening on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own.
Looking down, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> digging energetically in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered what <PER>Harry</PER> was doing; it looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> were making a new vegetable patch.
Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> snarling at each other, <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Hagrid</PER> digging until the darkness swallowed <PER>Harry</PER> and the owls around <PER>Harry</PER> began to awake, swooshing past <PER>Harry</PER> into the night.
By breakfast the next day <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bad moods had burnt out, and to <PER>Harry</PER>’s relief, <PER>Ron</PER>’s dark predictions that the house-elves would send substandard food up to the Gryffindor table because <PER>Hermione</PER> had insulted them proved false; the bacon, eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.
When the post owls arrived, <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up eagerly; <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be expecting something.
“Hey, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I think you’re in luck — ” A gray owl was soaring down toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, seizing <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver How many subscriptions's own letter first.
“Ow!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, tears starting in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes as <PER>Hermione</PER> tried to rub the pus off <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands with a napkin, but <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though <PER>Hermione</PER> were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves.
“You’d better get up to the hospital wing,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as the owls around <PER>Hermione</PER> took flight.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s was particularly efficient; it had soon filled <PER>Ron</PER>’s's lap with coins.
“Can you buy these as pets, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>?
“Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, grinning.
It turned out that <PER>Ron</PER>’s niffler had been most successful, so <PER>Hagrid</PER> gave him an enormous slab of Honeydukes chocolate for a prize.
The bell rang across the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set off back to the castle, but <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stayed behind to help <PER>Hagrid</PER> put the nifflers back in their boxes.
“What yeh done ter your hands, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking concerned.
<PER>Hermione</PER> told him about the hate mail <PER>Hermione</PER> had received that morning, and the envelope full of bubotuber pus.
“They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they, <PER>Ron</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER>, however, was frowning at the chocolate <PER>Hagrid</PER> had given him.
Then his said, “I hate being poor.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other.
Then, when <PER>Ron</PER> continued to look gloomy, she said, “Come on, <PER>Ron</PER>, it could be worse.
“I’ll get her back for this if it’s the last thing I do!” Hate mail continued to arrive for <PER>Hermione</PER> over the following week, and although <PER>Hermione</PER> followed <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill- wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole Hall to hear.
Even those people who didn’t read Witch Weekly knew all about the supposed <PER>Harry</PER>- Krum-<PER>Hermione</PER> triangle now.
<PER>Harry</PER> was getting sick of telling people that <PER>Hermione</PER> wasn’t <PER>Harry</PER>'s girlfriend.
<PER>Harry</PER> had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, <PER>Harry</PER> had to hold <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands clamped over them as <PER>Harry</PER> walked away from the class.
“Well, <PER>Rita</PER>’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!” <PER>Hermione</PER> panted five minutes later, catching up with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the entrance hall and pulling <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand away from one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wiggling ears so that <PER>Harry</PER> could hear her.
“Moody says Moody didn’t see Moody's anywhere near the judges’ table at the second task, or anywhere near the lake!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, is there any point in telling you to drop this?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> was fascinated, but <PER>Hermione</PER> interrupted them.
“Do we have to start a vendetta against <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter as well?” “I’m not asking you to help!” <PER>Hermione</PER> snapped.
<PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure <PER>Hermione</PER> was going to the library.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, did not ask <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> to help <PER>Hermione</PER>'s pursue vengeance against <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the Easter holidays.
<PER>Harry</PER> frankly marveled at the fact that <PER>Hermione</PER> could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> was working flat-out just to get through all their homework, though <PER>Harry</PER> made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for Sirius; after last summer, <PER>Harry</PER> had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry.
<PER>Harry</PER> enclosed notes to Sirius, telling <PER>Harry</PER> that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and that they were still waiting for an answer from Percy.
Both <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee.
“Gets it for the recipes.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked sadly at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s tiny egg.
Finally, in the last week of May, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> held Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> back in Transfiguration.
“Mister Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task.” So at half past eight that night, <PER>Harry</PER> left <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs.
“Fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels; Fleur reckons we’ve got to find treasure.” “That wouldn’t be too bad,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, thinking that <PER>Harry</PER> would simply ask <PER>Hagrid</PER> for a niffler to do the job for him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and Cedric made <PER>Harry</PER> and Cedric's way toward <PER>Harry</PER> and Cedric, climbing over the hedges.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to help <PER>Harry</PER> again, but just then, Krum tapped <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder.
“I’ll wait for you, <PER>Harry</PER>, shall I?” “No, it’s okay, Mister Bagman,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, suppressing a smile, “I think I can find the castle on my own, thanks.” <PER>Harry</PER> and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum did not set a course for the Durmstrang ship.
“What ’re we going this way for?” said <PER>Harry</PER> as they passed <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin and the illuminated Beauxbatons carriage.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because We’re friends.” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t quite believe <PER>Harry</PER> was having this conversation with Viktor Krum, the famous International Quidditch player.
It was as though the eighteen-year-old Krum thought he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was an equal — a real rival — “You haff never you haff not ” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> very firmly.
For a moment, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t recognize <PER>Harry</PER> then <PER>Harry</PER> realized it was Mister Crouch.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked as though <PER>Harry</PER> had been traveling for days.
The knees of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes were ripped and bloody, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face scratched; <PER>Harry</PER> was unshaven and gray with exhaustion.
“Isn’t he vith your Ministry?” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward Mister Crouch, who did not look at <PER>Harry</PER>, but continued to talk to a nearby tree. "
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at Krum, who had followed <PER>Harry</PER> into the trees, and was looking down at Crouch in alarm.
He reached out and seized a handful of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes, dragging <PER>Harry</PER> closer, though <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes were staring over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
“Must tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ” “Get up, Mister Crouch,” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly and clearly.
“Get up, I’ll take you to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” Mister Crouch’s eyes rolled forward onto <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s?” “That’s right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Crouch was pulling Crouch closer; <PER>Harry</PER> tried to loosen Crouch’s grip on <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, but it was too powerful.
“Warn <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ” “I’ll get Warn <PER>Dumbledore</PER> if you let go of me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’ll get <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I’ll be quicker, I know where <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s office is <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is mad,” said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch, who was still gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was Percy.
“Just stay with him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, starting to get up, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mister Crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> back to the ground.
“I escaped must warn must tell see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> my fault all my fault Bertha dead all my fault my son my fault tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> Potter <PER>Voldemort</PER> stronger <PER>Harry</PER> Potter ” “I’ll get <PER>Dumbledore</PER> if you let me go, Mister Crouch!” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Just keep him here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> free of Mister Crouch.
“I’ll be back with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Hurry, von’t you?” Krum called after <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted away from the forest and up through the dark grounds.
“C’mon!” But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because <PER>Harry</PER> shouted at it; <PER>Harry</PER> knew it was no good.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> started running as fast as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could toward the staircase — <PER>Harry</PER> skidded to a halt and looked around.
The wall was sliding shut behind <PER>Snape</PER> even as <PER>Snape</PER> beckoned <PER>Harry</PER> back toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What are you doing here, Potter?” “I need to see Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of <PER>Snape</PER> instead.
“I’ve got to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
“Didn’t you hear me, Potter?” <PER>Harry</PER> could tell <PER>Snape</PER> was thoroughly enjoying <PER>Harry</PER>, denying <PER>Harry</PER> the thing <PER>Harry</PER> wanted when <PER>Harry</PER> was so panicky.
“Look,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, “Crouch isn’t right — he’s — he’s out of his mind — he says he wants to warn — The stone wall behind <PER>Snape</PER> slid open.
“Professor!” <PER>Harry</PER> said, sidestepping <PER>Snape</PER> before <PER>Snape</PER> could speak, “Crouch is here — “Mister Crouch’s down in the forest, “Crouch wants to speak to you!” <PER>Harry</PER> expected <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to ask questions, but to <PER>Harry</PER>'s relief, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did nothing of the sort.
“Lead the way,” he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor behind <PER>Harry</PER>, leaving <PER>Snape</PER> standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly.
“What did Mister Crouch say, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase.
“Said Said wants to warn you said Said’s done something terrible Said mentioned his son and Bertha Jorkins and — and <PER>Voldemort</PER> something about <PER>Voldemort</PER> getting stronger.
“He’s not acting normally,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, hurrying along beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Over here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, moving in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, leading the way through the trees.
“They were here,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hurried forward.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> bent over Krum and gently lifted one of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyelids.
“Stay here.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s cabin.
Then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> bent over Krum again, pointed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and muttered, “Renneruate.” Krum opened his eyes.
When his saw <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his tried to sit up, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> put a hand on his shoulder and made his lie still.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — what the — ?” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Karkaroff, please, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply.
Neither <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> spoke again until they heard the unmistakable sounds of <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Fang returning.
“What is this?” he cried when he saw Krum on the ground and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> beside him.
“Apologize!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath, <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s massive fist at his throat, his feet dangling in midair.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, no\” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> shouted, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes flashing.
“Kindly escort <PER>Harry</PER> back up to the castle, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply.
How had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> known that, at that very moment, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to Sirius, to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> what had happened?
“He wasn’t trying to jinx me, He just wanted to talk about <PER>Hermione</PER> — ” “I’ll be havin’ a few words with her, an’ all,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> grimly, stomping up the stairs.
He clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were sitting, to tell them what had happened.
“It comes down to this,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, rubbing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s forehead.
“That’s why Viktor was gone when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got there.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had crept out of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius.
“Just go through it again, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“If <PER>Snape</PER> hadn’t held me up,” <PER>Harry</PER> said bitterly, “we might’ve got there in time.
“Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn’t — ” “Shh!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> suddenly.
Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand so that the name on it was covered.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw George half glance at Fred, before smiling at <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at one another.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’d probably blast us through the door if us wake <PER>Harry</PER> at the crack of dawn; <PER>Harry</PER>’ll think we’re trying to attack <PER>Harry</PER> while <PER>Harry</PER>’s asleep.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept checking <PER>Ron</PER>’s watch, having finally discarded <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, but <PER>Ron</PER>’s was moving so slowly <PER>Ron</PER>’s could have sworn it had stopped working too.
All three of them were so tired them could happily have put them's heads down on the desks and slept; even <PER>Hermione</PER> wasn’t taking even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s usual notes, but was sitting with even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head on even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand, gazing at Professor Binns with even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes out of focus.
“You can’t Disapparate on the grounds, <PER>Ron</PER>\” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Should be right up your street, this one,” said Moody, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER> and scratching <PER>Harry</PER>'s scarred and stubbly chin.
“You two,” counseled Moody, his normal eye on <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, “you stick close to Potter, all right?
It fluttered down beside <PER>Harry</PER> at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of <PER>Hermione</PER>, clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak.
Stay close to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm yourself for the third task.
Sirius “Who’s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?” said <PER>Harry</PER> in mild indignation as <PER>Harry</PER> folded up Sirius’s letter and put it inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice.
<PER>Harry</PER> was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which <PER>Harry</PER> had never used before.
The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on <PER>Ron</PER>’s and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s part.
“Can’t we kidnap Mistress Norris?” <PER>Ron</PER> suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been Stunned and reawoken by <PER>Harry</PER> for the fifth time in a row.
“Just try and fall backward!” “Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
“Why don’t you take a turn?” “Well, I think <PER>Harry</PER>’s got it now, anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily.
“See you at dinner!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off for Arithmancy, while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> headed toward North Tower, and Divination.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s head swam as <PER>Harry</PER>’s made <PER>Harry</PER>’s's way over to one of the curtained windows.
The heavily perfumed fumes washed over <PER>Harry</PER>, and the breeze from the window played across <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> had left the owl’s back <PER>Harry</PER> was watching, now, as it fluttered across the room, into a chair with its back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in Wormtail's body were on fire, the screaming filled <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears as the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead seared with pain; <PER>Harry</PER> was yelling too.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> would hear <PER>Voldemort</PER>, would know <PER>Voldemort</PER> was there.
Her great eyes loomed over <PER>Harry</PER>, gazing at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“See you later,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the bottom of shis stepladder, however, <PER>Harry</PER> did not set off for the hospital wing.
Sirius had told <PER>Harry</PER> what to do if <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar hurt <PER>Harry</PER> again, and <PER>Harry</PER> was going to follow <PER>Harry</PER>'s advice: <PER>Harry</PER> was going straight to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
<PER>Harry</PER> marched down the corridors, thinking about what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the dream it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken <PER>Harry</PER> on Privet Drive.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran over the details in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, trying to make sure <PER>Harry</PER> could remember them.
<PER>Harry</PER> had heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> accusing Wormtail of making a blunder but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was going to be fed to it instead.
<PER>Harry</PER> had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office without noticing.
<PER>Harry</PER> blinked, looked around, realized what <PER>Harry</PER> had done, and retraced <PER>Harry</PER>'s steps, stopping in front of it.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know the password.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked The gargoyle, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s big toe.
“<PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog!” <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog!
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I’m afraid I don’t see the connection, don’t see the connection at all!” It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge.
“Either Crouch has finally cracked — more than likely, I’m sure you’ll agree, given Crouch's personal history — lost Crouch's mind, and gone wandering off somewhere — ” “He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, <PER>Cornelius</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office once before; it was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, all of whom's chests rising and falling gently.
<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge was standing beside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk, wearing <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge] usual pinstriped cloak and holding his lime-green bowler hat.
Then, feeling it was pointless to pretend that he hadn’t overheard what they had been saying, he added, “I didn’t see Madame Maxime anywhere, though, and Madame Maxime’d have a job hiding, wouldn’t Madame Maxime?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> smiled at <PER>Harry</PER> behind Fudge’s back, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes twinkling.
“Yes, well,” said Fudge, looking embarrassed, “we’re about to go for a short walk on the grounds, <PER>Harry</PER>, if you’ll excuse we perhaps if you just go back to your class — ” “I wanted to talk to you, Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly, looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who gave him a swift, searching look.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down in a chair in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk.
For several minutes, <PER>Harry</PER> sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in the old headmasters's frames, thinking about what <PER>Harry</PER> had just heard, and running <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers over <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar.
It looked like light made liquid — or like wind made solid — <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t make up — <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent closer, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head right inside the cabinet.
many teachers at Hogwarts seemed, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, to be waiting for something; even though <PER>Harry</PER> could only see the tops of many teachers at Hogwarts's hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to one another.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned even closer, tilting <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, trying to see The tip of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose touched the strange substance into which <PER>Harry</PER> was staring.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office gave an almighty lurch — <PER>Harry</PER> was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin — But — <PER>Harry</PER>'s head did not hit the stone bottom.
head was falling through something icy-cold and black; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool — And suddenly, — <PER>Harry</PER> found — <PER>Harry</PER> sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others.
's 
— <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at the high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which — <PER>Harry</PER> had just been staring, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.
Breathing hard and fast, <PER>Harry</PER> looked around <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to the wizard next to <PER>Harry</PER> on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting right next to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ignored <PER>Harry</PER> completely.
<PER>Harry</PER> gazed, nonplussed, at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, then around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Once before, <PER>Harry</PER> had found <PER>Harry</PER> somewhere that nobody could see or hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
That time, <PER>Harry</PER> had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right into somebody else’s memory and unless <PER>Harry</PER> was very much mistaken, something of the sort had happened again.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not blink, look around at <PER>Harry</PER>, or indeed move at all.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t ignore <PER>Dumbledore</PER> like that.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was inside a memory, and this was not the present-day <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Yet it couldn’t be that long ago <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sitting next to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> <PER>Dumbledore</PER> now was silver-haired, just like the present-day <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The room, as <PER>Harry</PER> had suspected when observing it from above, was almost certainly underground — more of a dungeon than a room, <PER>Harry</PER> thought.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were, <PER>Harry</PER> heard footsteps.
The man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t blame <PER>Harry</PER> knew the dementors could not touch <PER>Harry</PER> inside a memory, but <PER>Harry</PER> remembered their power only too well.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw Mister Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> heard, quite distinctly, from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s other side, a familiar, growling voice saying, “Filth.” <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward so that <PER>Harry</PER> could see past <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that this news had come as a real blow to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> once more, and saw <PER>Harry</PER> indicating the large chunk out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see that <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to worry that none of <PER>Harry</PER>'s information would be of any use to the Ministry.
“Wait, I have more!” <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER> sweating in the torchlight, <PER>Harry</PER>'s white skin contrasting strongly with the black of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair and beard.
“<PER>Snape</PER>!” <PER>Snape</PER>!
“Severus <PER>Snape</PER>!” “Severus <PER>Snape</PER> has been cleared by this council,” said Crouch disdainfully.
““Severus <PER>Snape</PER> has been vouched for by Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “No!” shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that bound “Severus <PER>Snape</PER> to the chair.
Severus <PER>Snape</PER> was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s back.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around; the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke; everything was fading; <PER>Harry</PER> could see only his own body — all else was swirling darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sitting beside <PER>Harry</PER> again, wearing different robes.
“You never spoke a truer word, boy,” someone muttered dryly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were still sitting beside Mister Crouch, but the atmosphere could not have been more different.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up at Crouch and saw that <PER>Harry</PER> looked gaunter and grayer than ever before.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> looked on <PER>Harry</PER>'s other side.
There was an Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sitting on his right, watching Crouch’s son being dragged away by the dementors — and there was an Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on his left, looking right at an Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on his.
“Come,” said the an Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on his on his left, and his put his hand under <PER>Harry</PER>’s elbow.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around <PER>Harry</PER>; for a moment, all was blackness, and then <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> had done a slow-motion somersault, suddenly landing flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, in what seemed like the dazzling light of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s sunlit office.
“Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, “I know I shouldn’t’ve — I didn’t mean — the cabinet door was sort of open and “I quite understand,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> lifted the basin, carried it over to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> motioned for <PER>Harry</PER> to sit down opposite <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Let me show you.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drew <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand out of the inside of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> added this fresh thought to the basin, and <PER>Harry</PER>, astonished, saw <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own face swimming around the surface of the bowl.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> placed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold and <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own face change smoothly into <PER>Snape</PER>’s, who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.
“It’s coming back Karkaroff’s too stronger and clearer than ever ” “A connection I could have made without assistance,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sighed, “but never mind.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> peered over the top of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s half-moon spectacles at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was gaping at <PER>Snape</PER>’s face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head.
her took no notice whatsoever of <PER>Harry</PER> or Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“That was Bertha as I remember her at school.” The silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s face, and it struck <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly how very old <PER>Harry</PER> was looking.
very old <PER>Harry</PER> knew, of course, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was getting on in years, but somehow very old <PER>Harry</PER> never really thought of <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as an old man.
“So, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly.
“It woke me up, It hurt so badly.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> merely looked at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I have also been in contact with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ever since <PER>Dumbledore</PER> left Hogwarts last year.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stopped pacing and looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat back down at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk.
“D’you — D’you know why my scar’s hurting me?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked very intently at <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, and then said, “I have a theory, no more than that.
“How indeed Neither <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> spoke for a while.
It was the characteristic, piercing look <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had given <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on other occasions, and always made <PER>Harry</PER> feel as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were seeing right through <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in a way that even Moody’s magical eye could not.
“Once again, <PER>Harry</PER>, I can only give you my suspicions.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sighed again, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked older, and wearier, than ever.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> ought to go, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s curiosity held <PER>Harry</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
“Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Has <PER>Neville</PER> never told you why <PER>Neville</PER> has been brought up by <PER>Neville</PER>'s grandmother?” he said.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, wondering, as <PER>Harry</PER> did so, how <PER>Harry</PER> could have failed to ask <PER>Neville</PER> this, in almost four years of knowing <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes, they were talking about <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“No,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his voice full of a bitterness <PER>Harry</PER> had never heard there before.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> shook <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head.
“Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly now that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had stopped adding thoughts.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> glanced down into <PER>Snape</PER>’s face, and then up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked into <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s light blue eyes, and the thing <PER>Harry</PER> really wanted to know spilled out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop it.
“What made you think <PER>Harry</PER>’d really stopped supporting <PER>Voldemort</PER>, Professor?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> held <PER>Harry</PER>’s gaze for a few seconds, and then said, “That, <PER>Harry</PER>, is a matter between Professor <PER>Snape</PER> and myself.” <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the interview was over; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not look angry, yet there was a finality in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s tone that told <PER>Harry</PER> it was time to go.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood up, and so did <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” he said as <PER>Harry</PER> reached the door.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was standing over the Pensieve, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older than ever.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment, and then said, “Good luck with the third task.” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> reckons You- Know- Who’s getting stronger again as well?” <PER>Ron</PER> whispered.
Everything <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the Pensieve, nearly everything <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told and shown <PER>Harry</PER> afterward, <PER>Harry</PER> had now shared with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> — and, of course, with Sirius, to whom <PER>Harry</PER> had sent an owl the moment he had left <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind was reeling, until <PER>Harry</PER> understood what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> shiver slightly, even though the evening was warm.
“And he trusts <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> said.
“he really trusts <PER>Snape</PER>, even though he knows he was a Death Eater?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s forehead in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands, staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knees.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Hermione</PER> too looked as though <PER>Hermione</PER> could have done with a Pensieve.
“<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter,” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter muttered finally.
“And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, turning back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but <PER>Harry</PER>’s only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.” “We never thought of her, did We?” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly.
“Look what happened to <PER>Hagrid</PER> when <PER>Rita</PER> found out about his mother.
As <PER>Harry</PER> pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas, <PER>Harry</PER> looked over at <PER>Neville</PER>’s bed.
True to his word to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, he had not told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> about <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents.
his often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as his listened to <PER>Neville</PER>’s snores, his thought that <PER>Neville</PER> deserved it more than <PER>Neville</PER> did.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch’s son and <PER>Harry</PER>'s companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors.
It was <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, staring up at the canopy of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed in the darkness, it all came back to <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were supposed to be studying for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s exams, which would finish on the day of the third task, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were putting most of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s efforts into helping <PER>Harry</PER> prepare.
“Don’t worry about it,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said shortly when <PER>Harry</PER> pointed this out to them and said <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t mind practicing on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own for a while, “at least we’ll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to find <PER>Harry</PER>'s way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time <PER>Harry</PER> had some notice, some chance to prepare <PER>Harry</PER> for what lay ahead.
Tired of walking in on <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> all over the school, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes.
<PER>Harry</PER> had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable <PER>Harry</PER> to blast solid objects out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling his to check whether his was going in the right direction within the maze.
This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around his that deflected minor curses; <PER>Hermione</PER> managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and <PER>Harry</PER> wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx.
“You’re still doing really well, though,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said encouragingly, looking down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s list and crossing off those spells they had already learned.
“What’s <PER>Malfoy</PER> doing?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> went to see.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was holding <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hand up to <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s mouth and speaking into his mouth.
Like <PER>Hermione</PER>, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting <PER>Harry</PER> through the last task before they concerned they with anything else.
he reminded <PER>Harry</PER> in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of Hogwarts was not <PER>Harry</PER>’s responsibility, nor was it within <PER>Harry</PER>'s power to influence it.
If <PER>Voldemort</PER> is really getting stronger again, <PER>Voldemort</PER> wrote, my priority is to ensure your safety.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s protection, but all the same, take no risks : Concentrate on getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other matters.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together, staring at her.
“Nothing,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but <PER>Ron</PER> grabbed the paper.
“<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter again?” “No,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and just like <PER>Hermione</PER>, he attempted to push the paper out of sight.
But before <PER>Harry</PER> could demand to see the paper, <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table.
“Let me see it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned it over and found <PER>Harry</PER> staring at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own picture, beneath the banner headline: The boy who defeated <PER>Voldemort</PER> is unstable and possibly dangerous, writes <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, Special Correspondent.
“This could be a plea for attention.” The Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts about <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thatAlbus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from the wizarding public.
“Potter can speak Parseltongue, ” reveals <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, a Hogwarts fourth year.
“You tell me how <PER>Hermione</PER> did it!” “I’ve been trying!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ran <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers through <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair again, and then held <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand up to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth, as though speaking into an invisible walkie-talkie.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> stared at each other.
“S’pose so,” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>; but just then, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> came walking alongside the Gryffindor table toward Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“But the task’s not till tonight!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down <PER>Harry</PER>'s front, afraid <PER>Harry</PER> had mistaken the time.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as <PER>Harry</PER> crossed to the side chamber and entered.
<PER>Harry</PER> stayed where <PER>Harry</PER> was.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no family — no family who would turn up to see <PER>Harry</PER> risk <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, anyway.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come on, they’re waiting for you!” Utterly perplexed, <PER>Harry</PER> got up.
“You all right?” said Bill, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER> and shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“him’s been angry ever since <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s article about the Triwizard Tournament — you know, when <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter made out you were the only Hogwarts champion.” “Didn’t bother to correct <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, though, did he?” said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for <PER>Harry</PER> to hear as <PER>Harry</PER> started to walk out of the door with Molly and Bill.
“Are you going to tell us — ?” <PER>Hermione</PER> shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head warningly and glanced at Molly.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked between them, then said, “Molly, you didn’t believe that rubbish <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you?
As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> rose to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet at the staff table, and silence fell.
It was sort of true; <PER>Harry</PER> was nervous, but <PER>Harry</PER> kept running over all the hexes and spells <PER>Harry</PER> had been practicing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind as they walked, and the knowledge that <PER>Harry</PER> could remember them all made <PER>Harry</PER> feel better.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, Professor Moody, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions.
“Good luck, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> whispered, and the four of them walked away in different directions, to station them around the maze.
“And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!” <PER>Harry</PER> could just make out Molly, Bill, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands.
<PER>Harry</PER> waved up at them, and them waved back, beaming at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt almost as though <PER>Harry</PER> were underwater again.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, muttered, “Lumos,” and heard Cedric do the same just behind Cedric.
“See you,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER> took the left one, while Cedric took the right.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned right, and hurried on, holding <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand high over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, trying to see as far ahead as possible.
The old feeling that <PER>Harry</PER> was being watched was upon <PER>Harry</PER>.
The path ahead was empty too, and when <PER>Harry</PER> reached a right turn and took it, <PER>Harry</PER> again found <PER>Harry</PER>'s way unblocked.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then, as <PER>Harry</PER> turned a corner, <PER>Harry</PER> saw a dementor gliding toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear its rattling breath; <PER>Harry</PER> felt clammy coldness stealing over <PER>Harry</PER>, but knew what <PER>Harry</PER> had to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> summoned the happiest thought <PER>Harry</PER> could, concentrated with all <PER>Harry</PER>'s might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, raised his wand, and cried, “Expecto Patronum).” A silver stag erupted from the end of <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand and galloped toward the dementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished it could have stayed, <PER>Harry</PER> could have used some company but <PER>Harry</PER> moved on, quickly and quietly as possible, listening hard, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held high once more.
Left right left again Twice <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> facing dead ends.
Twice <PER>Harry</PER> did the Four-Point Spell again and found that Twice <PER>Harry</PER> was going too far east.
Twice <PER>Harry</PER> turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of Twice <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was hanging from the ground, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair on end, <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses dangling off <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless sky.
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched them to the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose and hung there, terrified.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell forward onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees onto the wonderfully solid ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder as <PER>Harry</PER> ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at <PER>Harry</PER> in the moonlight.
<PER>Harry</PER> took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease but at the same time, <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t help thinking, One champion down The cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though Fleur was no longer in the running.
“Stupefy'.” The spell hit the skrewt’s armor and rebounded; <PER>Harry</PER> ducked just in time, but could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
Panting, <PER>Harry</PER> pushed <PER>Harry</PER> away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of the skrewt legs at any moment.
Horrified, <PER>Harry</PER> began sprinting up <PER>Harry</PER>'s path, trying to find a way into Cedric’s.
It wasn’t very effective, but It burned a small hole in the hedge through which <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg, kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening; <PER>Harry</PER> struggled through It, tearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, and looking to <PER>Harry</PER>'s right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the ground, Krum standing over Cedric.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> up and pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at Krum just as Krum looked up.
<PER>Harry</PER> dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands over <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around <PER>Harry</PER> and Cedric.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure <PER>Harry</PER> was moving in the right direction.
Every so often <PER>Harry</PER> hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made <PER>Harry</PER> feel sure <PER>Harry</PER> was getting near the heart of the maze.
Then, as <PER>Harry</PER> strode down a long, straight path, <PER>Harry</PER> saw movement once again, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which <PER>Harry</PER> had only seen in picture form, in <PER>Harry</PER>'s Monster Book of Monsters.
<PER>Harry</PER> took that for a “yes.” <PER>Harry</PER> cast <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind around.
“Thanks!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and, amazed at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own brilliance, <PER>Harry</PER> dashed forward.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to be close now, <PER>Harry</PER> had to be.
<PER>Harry</PER> wand was telling <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was bang on course; as long as <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t meet anything too horrible, <PER>Harry</PER> might have a chance.
Cedric was sprinting as fast as Cedric could toward the cup, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> would never catch up, Cedric was much taller, had much longer legs — Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw something immense over a hedge to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left, moving quickly along a path that intersected with <PER>Harry</PER>'s own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen it — “Cedric!” <PER>Harry</PER> bellowed.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Cedric’s wand fly out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon Cedric.
“Stupefy'.” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled; the spell hit the spider’s gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at <PER>Harry</PER> instead.
<PER>Harry</PER> was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to kick it; <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg connected with the pincers and next moment <PER>Harry</PER> was in excruciating pain.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear Cedric yelling “Stupefy'.” too, but his spell had no more effect than <PER>Harry</PER>’s — <PER>Harry</PER> raised — <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted “ Expelliarmus'.” It worked — the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that <PER>Harry</PER> fell twelve feet onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s already injured leg, which crumpled beneath <PER>Harry</PER>.
Without pausing to think, <PER>Harry</PER> aimed high at the spider’s underbelly, as <PER>Harry</PER> had done with the skrewt, and shouted “Stupefyl” just as Cedric yelled the same thing.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw the longing expression on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face in its golden light.
He felt angry; He's leg was very painful, He was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all He's efforts, Cedric had beaten Cedric to it, just as Cedric’d beaten <PER>Harry</PER> to ask <PER>Cho</PER> to the ball.
“Just take it, then we can get out of here.” Cedric watched <PER>Harry</PER> steadying <PER>Harry</PER>, holding tight to the hedge.
“I would’ve gone down in the first task if you hadn’t told me what was coming.” “I had help on that too,” <PER>Harry</PER> snapped, trying to mop up <PER>Harry</PER>'s bloody leg with <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“We’re still square,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, testing <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg gingerly; it shook violently as <PER>Harry</PER> put weight on it; <PER>Harry</PER> had sprained <PER>Harry</PER>'s ankle when the spider had dropped <PER>Harry</PER>.
For one shining moment, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> emerging from the maze, holding it.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> holding the Triwizard Cup aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw <PER>Cho</PER>’s face shining with admiration, more clearly than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen it before and then the picture faded, and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> staring at Cedric’s shadowy, stubborn face.
“Come here.” he grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm below the shoulder and helped <PER>Harry</PER> limp toward the plinth where the cup stood.
Instantly, <PER>Harry</PER> felt a jerk somewhere behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s navel.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling <PER>Harry</PER> onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet slam into the ground; <PER>Harry</PER>'s injured leg gave way, and <PER>Harry</PER> fell forward; <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last.
Cedric got up, pulled <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, and they looked around.
“Wands out, d’you reckon?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding it arms, <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that it was carrying something.
Whoever it was, <PER>Harry</PER> was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to obscure his face.
<PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric.
It was agony such as <PER>Harry</PER> had never felt in all <PER>Harry</PER>'s life; <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand slipped from <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.
From far away, above his head, his heard a high, cold voice say, “Kill the spare.” A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night: “Avada KedavraV’ A blast of green light blazed through <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyelids, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard something heavy fall to the ground beside <PER>Harry</PER>; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that his retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what his was about to see, his opened his stinging eyes.
Once sure that <PER>Harry</PER> was bound so tightly to the headstone that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak and stuffed it roughly into <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth; then, without a word, <PER>Harry</PER> turned from <PER>Harry</PER> and hurried away.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t make a sound, nor could <PER>Harry</PER> see where Wormtail had gone; <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t turn <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to see beyond the headstone; <PER>Harry</PER> could see only what was right in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched it, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar seared with pain again and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly knew that <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want to see what was in those robes <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t want that bundle opened.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear noises at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where <PER>Harry</PER> was tied.
Then he came back within <PER>Harry</PER>’s range of vision, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER> pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave.
It was full of what seemed to be water — <PER>Harry</PER> could hear it slopping around — and it was larger than any cauldron — <PER>Harry</PER> had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a full-grown man to sit in.
Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them, and <PER>Harry</PER> let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
As he did so, his hood fell back, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail’s weak, pale face in the firelight as <PER>Harry</PER> carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron.
Let it drown, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar burning almost past endurance, please let it drown.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened — <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes as tightly as <PER>Harry</PER> could, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER> had been stabbed with the dagger too.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stand to look but the potion had turned a burning red; the light of the potion shone through <PER>Harry</PER>’s closed eyelids Wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony.
Not until <PER>Harry</PER> felt Wormtail’s anguished breath on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face did <PER>Harry</PER> realize that Wormtail was right in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“B-blood of the enemy forcibly taken you will resurrect your foe.” <PER>Harry</PER> could do nothing to prevent it, <PER>Harry</PER> was tied too tightly.
Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtail’s remaining hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt its point penetrate the crook of <PER>Harry</PER>'s right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of <PER>Harry</PER>'s torn robes.
A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, so that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air It’s gone wrong, <PER>Harry</PER> thought it’s drowned please please let it be dead But then, through the mist in front of him, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, with an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the cauldron.
The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> stared back into the face that had haunted <PER>Harry</PER>'s nightmares for three years.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> looked away from <PER>Harry</PER> and began examining <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own body.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> hands were like large, pale spiders; <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s long white fingers caressed <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own chest, His's arms, His's face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat’s, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> caressed it gently too; and then <PER>Voldemort</PER> raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where <PER>Harry</PER> was tied; <PER>Harry</PER> fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> turned <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scarlet eyes upon <PER>Harry</PER>, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.
“The other arm, Wormtail.” “Master, please please ” <PER>Voldemort</PER> bent down and pulled out Wormtail’s left arm; <PER>Voldemort</PER> forced the sleeve of Wormtail’s robes up past <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s elbow, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo — a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth — the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark.
The scar on <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; <PER>Voldemort</PER> removed <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s fingers from Wormtail’s mark, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that it had turned jet black.
A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, <PER>Voldemort</PER> straightened up, threw back <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s head, and stared around at the dark graveyard.
After a minute or so, He looked down at <PER>Harry</PER> again, a cruel smile twisting <PER>Harry</PER>'s snakelike face.
“You stand, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, upon the remains of my late father,” <PER>Harry</PER> Potter hissed softly.
Then one of the Death Eaters fell to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s knees, crawled toward <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and kissed the hem of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s black robes.
The Death Eaters behind he did the same; each of them approaching <PER>Voldemort</PER> on <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s knees and kissing <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom <PER>Riddle</PER>’s grave, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail.
Let the police come, <PER>Harry</PER> thought desperately anyone anything <PER>Voldemort</PER> raised <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand.
“Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me and Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> rewards Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s helpers.
“Lucius, my slippery friend,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> whispered, halting before <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me — ” “And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> lazily, and Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> stopped talking abruptly.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had reached the largest gap of all, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> stood surveying it with <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s blank, red eyes, as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> could see people standing there.
“You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said softly, ” <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s red eyes upon <PER>Harry</PER>, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony.
The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in The Death Eaters's masks fixed upon <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and upon <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Crucio\” It was pain beyond anything <PER>Harry</PER> had ever experienced; <PER>Harry</PER>'s very bones were on fire; <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was surely splitting along <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar; <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes were rolling madly in his head; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted it to end to black out to die And then it was gone.
<PER>Harry</PER> was hanging limply in the ropes binding <PER>Harry</PER> to the headstone of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist.
Wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging <PER>Harry</PER>, and then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying <PER>Harry</PER> to the gravestone.
There was a split second, perhaps, when <PER>Harry</PER> might have considered running for it, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s injured leg shook under <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled.
Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric’s body lay and returned with <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, which <PER>Harry</PER> thrust roughly into <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand without looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You have been taught how to duel, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> softly, his red eyes glinting through the darkness.
At these words <PER>Harry</PER> remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club at Hogwarts <PER>Harry</PER> had attended briefly two years ago.
All he had learned there was the Disarming Spell, “ Expelliarmus” and what use would it be to deprive <PER>Voldemort</PER> of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand, even if <PER>Voldemort</PER> could, when <PER>Voldemort</PER> was surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one?
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had never learned anything that could possibly fit <PER>Voldemort</PER> for this.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> knew <PER>Voldemort</PER> was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned the un-blockable Avada Kedavra curse — and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was right — his mother was not here to die for his this time.
“We bow to each other, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, bending a little, but keeping <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s snakelike face upturned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not going to let <PER>Voldemort</PER> play with <PER>Harry</PER> before killing <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was not going to give <PER>Harry</PER> that satisfaction.
“I said, bow,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said, raising <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand — and <PER>Harry</PER> felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the Death Eaters laughed harder than ever.
“Very good,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> softly, and as <PER>Voldemort</PER> raised <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand the pressure bearing down upon <PER>Harry</PER> lifted too.
<PER>Harry</PER> rolled over and scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet; <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand had been cut off; <PER>Harry</PER> staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters, and they pushed <PER>Harry</PER> away, back toward <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“A little break,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>, the slit-like nostrils dilating with excitement, “a little pause That hurt, didn’t it, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“We are not playing hide-and-seek, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed.
And as he heard <PER>Voldemort</PER> draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s feet he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend he, even if no defense was possible.
Before <PER>Voldemort</PER> could stick <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s snakelike face around the headstone, <PER>Harry</PER> stood up <PER>Harry</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand tightly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, thrust it out in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, and threw <PER>Harry</PER> around the headstone, facing <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
As <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, “ ExpelliarmusV’ <PER>Voldemort</PER> cried, “Avada KedavraV’ A jet of green light issued from <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand just as a jet of red light blasted from <PER>Harry</PER>’s — they met in midair — and suddenly <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized up around it; his couldn’t have released it if his’d wanted to — and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold.
It was coming from every thread of the light- spun web vibrating around <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
It was a sound <PER>Harry</PER> recognized, though <PER>Harry</PER> had heard it only once before in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life: phoenix song.
It was the sound of hope to <PER>Harry</PER> the most beautiful and welcome thing <PER>Harry</PER> had ever heard in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the song were inside <PER>Harry</PER> instead of just around <PER>Harry</PER>.
I know, <PER>Harry</PER> told the music, I know I mustn’t but no sooner had <PER>Harry</PER> thought it, than the thing became much harder to do.
<PER>Harry</PER> wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever and now the beam between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER> changed too it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands — <PER>Harry</PER> felt — <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand give a shudder under wand's hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily wand's way .
As the closest bead of light moved nearer to <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand tip, the wood beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers grew so hot <PER>Harry</PER> feared it would burst into flame.
The closer that bead moved, the harder <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand vibrated; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand would not survive contact with wand; wand felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers — He concentrated every last particle of He's mind upon forcing the bead back toward <PER>Voldemort</PER>, He's ears full of phoenix song, He's eyes furious, fixed and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way and it was <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s wand that was vibrating extra- hard now <PER>Voldemort</PER> who looked astonished, and almost fearful.
<PER>Harry</PER> didn’t understand why <PER>Harry</PER> was doing it, didn’t know what it might achieve but <PER>Harry</PER> now concentrated as <PER>Harry</PER> had never done in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life on forcing that bead of light right back into <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand and slowly very slowly it moved along the golden thread it trembled for a moment and then it connected.
At once, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain then — <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s red eyes widened with shock — a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail more shouts of pain and then something much larger began to blossom from <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke.
If ever <PER>Harry</PER> might have released <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand from shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept <PER>Harry</PER> clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost?
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s wide red eyes were still shocked <PER>Harry</PER> had no more expected this than <PER>Harry</PER> had and, very dimly, <PER>Harry</PER> heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling around the edges of the golden dome.
More screams of pain from the wand and then something else emerged from the wand tip the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso an old man <PER>Harry</PER> had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done and himself's ghost, or himself's shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric’s, and surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick .
<PER>Harry</PER>, both arms shaking now as <PER>Harry</PER> fought to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring.
“Don’t let him get you, <PER>Harry</PER> — don’t let go!” She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to <PER>Harry</PER>, and hissed words <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t hear to <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
And now another head was emerging from the tip of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand and <PER>Harry</PER> knew when <PER>Harry</PER> saw it who it would be <PER>Harry</PER> knew, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand knew, because the woman was the one he’d thought of more than any other tonight.
He walked close to <PER>Harry</PER>, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>, and He spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that <PER>Voldemort</PER>, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around his, could not hear .
“When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments but we will give you time you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts do you understand, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s hand had closed on Cedric’s wrist; one tombstone stood between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>, but Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reach — <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s red eyes flamed in the darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth curl into a smile, saw <PER>Harry</PER> raise <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught it by the handle — <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s scream of fury at the same moment that <PER>Voldemort</PER> felt the jerk behind <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s navel that meant the Portkey had worked — it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> slam flat into the ground; <PER>Harry</PER>'s face was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled <PER>Harry</PER>'s nostrils.
<PER>Harry</PER> had closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes while the Portkey transported <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> kept them closed now.
All the breath seemed to have been knocked out of <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was swimming so badly <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the ground beneath <PER>Harry</PER> were swaying like the deck of a ship.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s dead!” The words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around them and then others shouted it — screeched it — into the night — “He’s dead!” “He’s dead!” “Cedric Diggory!
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you can’t help <PER>Harry</PER> now.
“<PER>Harry</PER> wanted me to bring <PER>Harry</PER> back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents.
<PER>Harry</PER> injured leg would no longer support <PER>Harry</PER>'s weight.
“He’s ill, He’s injured — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Diggory’s parents, they’re here, — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Diggory’s parents, they’re in the stands.
“It’s all right, son, I’ve got you come on hospital wing ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> said stay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> thickly, the pounding in <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar making <PER>Harry</PER> feel as though <PER>Harry</PER> was about to throw up; <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision was blurring worse than ever.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting <PER>Harry</PER> pushed a path through people, taking <PER>Harry</PER> back to the castle.
Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, <PER>Harry</PER> heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping <PER>Harry</PER> walk.
“What happened, <PER>Harry</PER>?” the man asked at last as the man lifted <PER>Harry</PER> up the stone steps.
“Took me and Cedric to a graveyard and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was there Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> ” Clunk.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Blood,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> should have told <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> should have said it straightaway “There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts!
“You didn’t do that you can’t have done ” “I assure you I did,” said Moody, and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was making sure that there was no one outside it.
The door was barred, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> would never reach <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand in time.
<PER>Harry</PER>, still staring at the place where Moody’s face had been, saw Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looking back at <PER>Harry</PER> out of the Foe-Glass.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in front, <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand outstretched.
At that moment, <PER>Harry</PER> fully understood for the first time why people said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was the only wizard <PER>Voldemort</PER> had ever feared.
The look upon <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s face as he stared down at the unconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more terrible than <PER>Harry</PER> could have ever imagined.
There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> were giving off burning heat.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moody’s unconscious body, and kicked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> over onto <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s back, so that <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face was visible.
<PER>Snape</PER> followed <PER>Snape</PER>, looking into the Foe-Glass, where <PER>Snape</PER>'s own face was still visible, glaring into the room.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> went straight to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ought to — look at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s been through enough tonight — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will stay, Minerva, because <PER>Dumbledore</PER> needs to understand,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> curtly.
Then He turned to Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched, astounded, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk, and each time revealing different contents.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and <PER>Harry</PER> let out a cry of amazement.
<PER>Harry</PER> wooden leg was gone, the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath the magical eye lid, and chunks of <PER>Harry</PER>'s grizzled hair were missing.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> climbed into the trunk, lowered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping Moody.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> bent over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Polyjuice Potion, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw a man lying before <PER>Harry</PER>, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew who <PER>Harry</PER> was.
<PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER> in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve, had watched <PER>Harry</PER> being led away from court by the dementors, trying to convince Mister Crouch that he was innocent but <PER>Harry</PER> was lined around the eyes now and looked much older .
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> got up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled <PER>Dumbledore</PER> into a sitting position against the wall beneath the Foe- Glass, in which the reflections of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>, and <PER>McGonagall</PER> were still glaring down upon them all.
Then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pointed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand at the man’s chest and said, “Rennervate.” Crouch’s son opened Crouch’s son's eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knelt before <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, so that their faces were level.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with disgust on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face.
Then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly.
“Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take <PER>Harry</PER> upstairs?” “Of course,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Severus” — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to <PER>Snape</PER> — “please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” — <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said gently.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up and swayed again; the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg, which <PER>Harry</PER> had not noticed all the time <PER>Harry</PER> had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure.
<PER>Harry</PER> also realized that <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> gripped <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s arm and helped <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out into the dark corridor.
“Professor,” <PER>Harry</PER> mumbled, “where are Mister and Mistress Diggory?” “They are with Professor Sprout,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave the password, it sprang aside, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door.
So tired every bone in <PER>Harry</PER>'s body was aching, <PER>Harry</PER> wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until <PER>Harry</PER> fell asleep and didn’t have to think or feel anymore.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat down opposite <PER>Harry</PER>, behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, who avoided <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was going to question <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was going to make <PER>Harry</PER> relive everything.
“I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had put a hand on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
Very unwillingly, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and looked into those blue eyes.
It shivered in the air, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat into <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach, warming <PER>Harry</PER>, and strengthening him.
As <PER>Harry</PER> spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes; <PER>Harry</PER> saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived <PER>Voldemort</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; <PER>Harry</PER> saw Cedric’s body, lying on the ground beside the cup.
Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to stop <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now <PER>Harry</PER> had started.
It was even a relief; <PER>Harry</PER> felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from <PER>Harry</PER>.
It was costing <PER>Harry</PER> every bit of determination <PER>Harry</PER> had to keep talking, yet <PER>Harry</PER> sensed that once <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, <PER>Harry</PER> would feel better.
When <PER>Harry</PER> told of Wormtail piercing <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood up so quickly that <PER>Harry</PER> started.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked around the desk and told <PER>Harry</PER> to stretch out <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> showed them both the place where <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes were torn and the cut beneath them.
“<PER>Harry</PER> said my blood would make <PER>Harry</PER> stronger than if him’d used someone else’s,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
But next second, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> had imagined it, for when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had returned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat behind the desk, <PER>Harry</PER> looked as old and weary as <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen him.
Then “<PER>Voldemort</PER> told how <PER>Voldemort</PER> had untied <PER>Voldemort</PER>, returned <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and prepared to duel.
But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wands, <PER>Voldemort</PER> found <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s throat obstructed.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had come out of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand were flooding into <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s mind.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins his father his mother <PER>Voldemort</PER> was glad when Sirius broke the silence.
“The wands connected?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said, looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Why?” <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> looked up at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> again, on whose face there was an arrested look.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s wand and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand share cores.
At this point, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> could not continue.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at Sirius and saw that <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s face in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
<PER>Harry</PER> suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left <PER>Harry</PER>'s knee.
<PER>Harry</PER> transformed back into the great black dog and walked with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out of the office, accompanying <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.
When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pushed open the door, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Molly, Bill, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey.
They appeared to be demanding to know where <PER>Harry</PER> was and what had happened to <PER>Harry</PER>.
All of them whipped around as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and the black dog entered, and Molly let out a kind of muffled scream.
She rounded on <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear?
“I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
As Madam Pomfrey led <PER>Harry</PER> to a nearby bed, <PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of the real Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room.
“he’ll be fine,” said Madam Pomfrey, giving <PER>Harry</PER> some pajamas and pulling screens around <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Bill, Molly, and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> becoming drowsy at once.
Everything around <PER>Harry</PER> became hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at <PER>Harry</PER> in a friendly way through the screen around <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed; <PER>Harry</PER>'s body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress.
<PER>Harry</PER> woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t open <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, wanting to drop off again.
The room was still dimly lit; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t have been asleep very long.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> heard whispering around <PER>Harry</PER>.
“When <PER>Dumbledore</PER> finds out — ” <PER>Harry</PER> heard the hospital doors burst open.
Unnoticed by any of the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens, <PER>Harry</PER> sat up and put <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses back on.
Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Snape</PER> were at his heels.
“What has happened?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sharply, looking from Fudge to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“The Minister has seen to that!” <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> lose control like this.
“When we told Mister Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight’s events,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, in a low voice, “<PER>Snape</PER> seemed to feel <PER>Snape</PER>'s personal safety was in question.
“I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle, but — ” “My dear woman!” roared Fudge, who likewise looked angrier than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen him, “as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous — ” But Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s voice drowned Fudge’s.
“The moment that — that thing entered the room,” she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, “it swooped down on Crouch and — and — ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a chill in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach as Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> struggled to find words to describe what had happened.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> did not need Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s to finish Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s sentence.
“It seems he has been responsible for several deaths!” “But he cannot now give testimony, <PER>Cornelius</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
He too glanced at <PER>Harry</PER>, then looked back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and said, “You are — er — prepared to take <PER>Harry</PER>’s word on this, are you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” There was a moment’s silence, which was broken by Sirius growling.
“Certainly, I believe <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I heard Crouch’s confession, and I heard <PER>Harry</PER>’s account of what happened after <PER>Harry</PER> touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.” Fudge still had that strange smile on his face.
“You are prepared to believe that Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who well ” Fudge shot <PER>Harry</PER> another look, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly understood.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Molly, and Bill all jumped.
“It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!” <PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t believe what <PER>Harry</PER> was hearing.
But now a short, angry wizard stood before <PER>Harry</PER>, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in <PER>Harry</PER>'s comfortable and ordered world — to believe that <PER>Voldemort</PER> could have risen.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> has returned,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> repeated.
“What madness is this?” “Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “or <PER>Voldemort</PER> will persuade them, as <PER>Voldemort</PER> did before, that <PER>Voldemort</PER> alone among wizards will give them them's rights and them's freedom!” “You — you cannot be serious!” Fudge gasped, shaking his head and retreating further from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants — people hate them, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — end of my career — ” “You are blinded,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, him's eyes blazing once more, “by the love of the office you hold, <PER>Cornelius</PER>!
Finally, He said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, “his can’t be back, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, his just can’t be ” <PER>Snape</PER> strode forward, past <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as his went.
He stared, apparently repelled by the ugly mark on <PER>Snape</PER> ’s arm, then looked up at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and whispered, “I don’t know what you and your staff are playing at, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but I have heard enough.
The moment he had disappeared, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to look at the group around <PER>Harry</PER>’s bed.
him clapped a hand on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, kissed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.
“Minerva,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, turning to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, “I want to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> in my office as soon as possible.
“It’s okay!” <PER>Snape</PER> had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on <PER>Snape</PER>'s face was one of mingled fury and horror.
“You’ll see me very soon, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Sirius, turning to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Severus,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, turning to <PER>Snape</PER>, “you know what I must ask you to do.
“Then good luck,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> watched, with a trace of apprehension on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face, as <PER>Snape</PER> swept wordlessly after Sirius.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Mistress Weasley were all looking at him.
None of <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Mistress Weasley spoke for a very long time.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was holding something tight in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
From what <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> told him, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast.
He liked it best when He was with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and they were talking about other things, or else letting He sit in silence while they played chess.
The only time they touched upon the subject was when <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> about a meeting Molly had had with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> before going home.
“She went to ask <PER>Harry</PER> if you could come straight to us this summer,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“But <PER>Harry</PER> wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least at first.” “Why?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“She said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s got <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s reasons,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shaking his head darkly.
“I suppose we’ve got to trust him, haven’t we?” The only person apart from <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> felt able to talk to was <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“ <PER>Harry</PER>\” He strode out to meet them, pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into a one- armed hug, ruffled <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair, and said, “Good ter see yeh, mate.
When he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> closely through <PER>Harry</PER>'s beetle-black eyes.
“Knew he was goin’ ter come back,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up at him, shocked.
“Yeh did as much as yer father would’ve done, an’ I can’ give yeh no higher praise than that.” <PER>Harry</PER> smiled back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked you to do, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” ’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked.
“He sent Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> — that night.” “Got a little job fer me over the summer,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
k k k It was with a heavy heart that <PER>Harry</PER> packed <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk up in the dormitory on the night before <PER>Harry</PER>'s return to Privet Drive.
When he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the Hall, he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> saw at once that the usual decorations were missing.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t blame <PER>Harry</PER>; Moody’s fear of attack was bound to have been increased by <PER>Harry</PER>'s ten-month imprisonment in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own trunk.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered, as <PER>Harry</PER> sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether <PER>Voldemort</PER> had caught up with <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
Further along the table, sitting next to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, was <PER>Snape</PER>.
His eyes lingered on <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment as <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> continued to watch <PER>Harry</PER>, long after <PER>Snape</PER> had looked away.
What was it that <PER>Snape</PER> had done on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s orders, the night that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had returned?
And why why was <PER>Dumbledore</PER> so convinced that <PER>Snape</PER> was truly on their side?
<PER>Snape</PER> had turned spy against <PER>Voldemort</PER>, “at great personal risk.” Was that the job he had taken up again?
Pretended that he had never really gone over to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, that he had been, like <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself, biding his time?
<PER>Harry</PER>’s musings were ended by Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who stood up at the staff table.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> valued fair play.
Over at the Slytherin table, <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach.
<PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER> to look back at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I am talking, of course, about <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in <PER>Harry</PER>’s direction before flicking back to face <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter managed to escape Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
But through a gap in the standing figures, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who after all possessed no magical eye.
Krum, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though <PER>Harry</PER> expected <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to say something harsh.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> back to Hogsmeade station.
Beyond Fleur Delacour, far across the grounds, <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness.
“It ’az been a pleasure meeting you!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s spirits couldn’t help but lift slightly as <PER>Harry</PER> watched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime, Fleur's silvery hair rippling in the sunlight.
“The carriages’ll be here in a minute!” He let <PER>Harry</PER> keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few minutes craning <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and <PER>Hermione</PER> might be up to.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared at <PER>Hermione</PER>, but her face was quite impassive.
Krum held out Krum's hand as Fleur had done, shook <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, and then <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
Krum had already started walking away when <PER>Ron</PER> burst out, “Can I have your autograph?” <PER>Hermione</PER> turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had managed to get a compartment to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> talked more fully and freely than <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had all week as the train sped them southward.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s speech at the Leaving Feast had unblocked <PER>Harry</PER>, somehow.
They broke off They's conversation about what action <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might be taking, even now, to stop <PER>Voldemort</PER> only when the lunch trolley arrived.
When <PER>Hermione</PER> returned from the trolley and put <PER>Hermione</PER>'s money back into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s schoolbag, <PER>Hermione</PER> dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet that <PER>Hermione</PER> had been carrying in there.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at it, unsure whether <PER>Harry</PER> really wanted to know what it might say, but <PER>Hermione</PER>, seeing <PER>Harry</PER> looking at it, said calmly, “There’s nothing in there.
“Not on a story like this.” “Oh, <PER>Rita</PER> hasn’t written anything at all since the third task,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in an oddly constrained voice.
“I found out how “<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter was listening in on private conversations when “<PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter wasn’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rush.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the impression that <PER>Hermione</PER> had been dying to tell them this for days, but that <PER>Hermione</PER> had restrained <PER>Hermione</PER> in light of everything else that had happened.
“How was <PER>Hermione</PER> doing it?” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
“No, you see <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter” — <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s voice trembled with quiet triumph — “is an unregistered Animagus.
“There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard <PER>Hagrid</PER> telling Madame Maxime about his mum!” “Exactly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Very clever, Granger,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not been this close to <PER>Malfoy</PER> since <PER>Harry</PER> had watched <PER>Harry</PER> muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s speech about Cedric.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel a kind of ringing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
<PER>Harry</PER> hand gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand under his robes.
He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> were on He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, all three of He, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> having used a different hex.
But <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept on asking, and finally, Fred said, “All right, all right, if you really want to know it was Ludo Bagman.” “Bagman?” said <PER>Harry</PER> sharply.
The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; <PER>Harry</PER> wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that <PER>Harry</PER> would never arrive at King’s Cross but as <PER>Harry</PER> had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> struggled out past <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying their trunks.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled open <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and drew out <PER>Harry</PER>'s Triwizard winnings.
She hugged <PER>Harry</PER> very tightly when She saw <PER>Harry</PER> and whispered in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear, “I think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will let you come to us later in the summer.
“ ’Bye, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> did something <PER>Hermione</PER> had never done before, and kissed <PER>Harry</PER> on the cheek.
