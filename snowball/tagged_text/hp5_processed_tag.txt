<PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s appearance did not endear <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s to the neighbors, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden he behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby.
On the whole, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was to be congratulated on <PER>Harry</PER>'s idea of hiding here.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at <PER>Harry</PER>, grinding their teeth so loudly that <PER>Harry</PER> could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at <PER>Harry</PER>, as had happened every time <PER>Harry</PER> had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt and uncle.
<PER>Harry</PER> listened to a jingle about Fruit ’N Bran breakfast cereal while <PER>Harry</PER> watched Mistress Figg, a batty, cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very pleased that <PER>Harry</PER> was concealed behind the bush; Mistress Figg had recently taken to asking <PER>Harry</PER> around for tea whenever Mistress Figg met <PER>Harry</PER> in the street.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well that <PER>Dudley</PER> had not been to tea anywhere; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and throwing stones at passing cars and children.
<PER>Harry</PER> had seen them at it during <PER>Harry</PER>'s evening walks around Little Whinging; <PER>Harry</PER> had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way.
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o’clock news reached <PER>Harry</PER>’s ears and <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach turned over.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer.
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ living room, and as though <PER>Harry</PER> had been waiting for this signal, <PER>Harry</PER> jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans a thin wooden wand as if <PER>Harry</PER> were unsheathing a sword.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as if <PER>Harry</PER>'s head had been split in two; eyes streaming, <PER>Harry</PER> swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise, but <PER>Harry</PER> had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“Now\ Before — anyone — sees!” “Get — off — me!” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped; for a few seconds they struggled, <PER>Harry</PER> pulling at <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle’s sausage- like fingers with <PER>Harry</PER>'s left hand, <PER>Harry</PER>'s right maintaining a firm grip on <PER>Harry</PER>'s raised wand.
Then, as the pain in the top of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released <PER>Harry</PER> as though he had received an electric shock — some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making he impossible to hold.
<PER>Harry</PER> stuffed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand hastily back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans and tried to look innocent.
“Well, that’s news to me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call <PER>Harry</PER> back, <PER>Harry</PER> had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up the street.
<PER>Harry</PER> was in trouble now and <PER>Harry</PER> knew it.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have to face <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt and uncle later and pay the price for <PER>Harry</PER>'s rudeness, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not care very much just at the moment; <PER>Harry</PER> had much more pressing matters on <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
As this thought occurred him wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted again and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible <PER>Harry</PER> walked on, hardly aware of the route <PER>Harry</PER> was taking, for <PER>Harry</PER> had pounded these streets so often lately that <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet carried <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s favorite haunts automatically.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a dull, sinking sensation in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach and, before <PER>Harry</PER> knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again Tomorrow morning him would be awoken by the alarm at five o’clock so that him could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet — but was there any point in continuing to take it?
<PER>Harry</PER> merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind <PER>Harry</PER> cared about.
If <PER>Harry</PER> was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from <PER>Harry</PER>'s best friends, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, though any expectation he had had that their letters would bring he news had long since been dashed.
As far as <PER>Harry</PER> could tell from the vague hints in their letters, <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were in the same place, presumably at <PER>Ron</PER>’s parents’ house.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the Burrow when <PER>Harry</PER> was stuck in Privet Drive.
In fact, <PER>Harry</PER> was so angry at them that <PER>Harry</PER> had thrown both them's birthday presents of Honeydukes chocolates away unopened, though he had regretted this after eating the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.
And what were <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> busy with?
Don’t think about that, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> sternly for the hundredth time that summer.
It was bad enough that <PER>Harry</PER> kept revisiting the graveyard in <PER>Harry</PER>'s nightmares, without dwelling on it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s waking moments too.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along <PER>Harry</PER> passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where <PER>Harry</PER> had first clapped eyes on <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather.
Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how <PER>Harry</PER> was feeling; admittedly <PER>Harry</PER>'s letters were just as empty of proper news as <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s, but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints: “ I know this must be frustrating for you” “Keep your nose clean and everything will be okay” “Be careful and don’t do anything rash” Well, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, <PER>Harry</PER> had (by and large) done as Sirius advised; <PER>Harry</PER> had at least resisted the temptation to tie <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk to <PER>Harry</PER>'s broomstick and set off for the Burrow by <PER>Harry</PER>.
In fact <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER>'s behavior had been very good considering how frustrated and angry <PER>Harry</PER> felt at being stuck in Privet Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> was doing.
Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool he that <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> or Sirius would find that very interesting anymore In the past his scar hurting had warned that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was getting stronger again, but now that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was back they would probably remind <PER>Voldemort</PER> that its regular irritation was only to be expected Nothing to worry about old news The injustice of it all welled up inside <PER>Voldemort</PER> so that <PER>Voldemort</PER> wanted to yell with fury.
And <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that <PER>Voldemort</PER> could hear about water-skiing budgerigars!
How could <PER>Dumbledore</PER> have forgotten <PER>Dumbledore</PER> so easily?
Why had <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> got together without inviting him along too?
These furious thoughts whirled around in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around <PER>Harry</PER>, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings.
“The noble sport,” as Uncle Vernon called it, had made <PER>Dudley</PER> even more formidable than he had seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> in the primary school days when <PER>Harry</PER> had served as <PER>Dudley</PER>’s first punching bag.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not remotely afraid of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cousin anymore but <PER>Harry</PER> still didn’t think that <PER>Dudley</PER> learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration.
Look round, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> thinking as <PER>Harry</PER> watched them.
Come on look round I’m sitting here all alone Come and have ago If <PER>Dudley</PER>’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would <PER>Dudley</PER> do then?
him wouldn’t want to lose face in front of the gang, but He’d be terrified of provoking <PER>Harry</PER> It would be really fun to watch <PER>Dudley</PER>’s dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond and if any of the others tried hitting <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was ready — he had his wand let them try He’d love to vent some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell — But they did not turn around, they did not see <PER>Harry</PER>, they were almost at the railings.
<PER>Harry</PER> mastered the impulse to call after they Seeking a fight was not a smart move <PER>Harry</PER> must not use magic <PER>Harry</PER> would be risking expulsion again <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road.
Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock <PER>Harry</PER> in the shed if <PER>Harry</PER> came home after <PER>Dudley</PER> again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, <PER>Harry</PER> set off toward the park gate.
<PER>Harry</PER> preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and <PER>Harry</PER> ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about <PER>Harry</PER>'s “delinquent” appearance when <PER>Harry</PER> passed the householders.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road <PER>Dudley</PER>’s gang came into view again; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent.
When their voices had faded once more <PER>Harry</PER> headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly <PER>Harry</PER> soon came within hailing distance of <PER>Dudley</PER>, who was strolling along at <PER>Harry</PER>'s ease, humming tunelessly.
The effort of keeping himself from hitting <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to be demanding all <PER>Harry</PER>'s self-control.
“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, <PER>Harry</PER>'s grin fading.
It gave <PER>Harry</PER> enormous satisfaction to know how furious <PER>Harry</PER> was making <PER>Dudley</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> was siphoning off <PER>Harry</PER>'s own frustration into <PER>Harry</PER>'s cousin, the only outlet <PER>Harry</PER> had.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped too, staring at <PER>Harry</PER>'s cousin.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pointing the wand directly at <PER>Dudley</PER>’s heart.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel fourteen years’ hatred of <PER>Dudley</PER> pounding in <PER>Harry</PER>'s veins — what wouldn’t <PER>Harry</PER> give to strike now, to jinx <PER>Dudley</PER> so thoroughly <PER>Harry</PER>’d have to crawl home like an insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers — “Don’t ever talk about that again,” <PER>Harry</PER> snarled.
For a split second <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact that <PER>Harry</PER>’d been resisting as hard as <PER>Harry</PER> could — then <PER>Harry</PER>'s reason caught up with <PER>Harry</PER>'s senses — <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t have the power to turn off the stars.
— <PER>Harry</PER> turned — <PER>Harry</PER>'s head this way and that, trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on — <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes like a weightless veil.
<PER>Dudley</PER>’s terrified voice broke in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a horrible jolt of dread as <PER>Harry</PER> stood trembling in the freezing air.
Small white lights popped in front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes; for the second time in an hour <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s head had been cleaved in two; next moment <PER>Harry</PER> had landed hard on the ground, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand had flown out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“You moron, <PER>Dudley</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes watering with pain, as <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in the blackness.
At the same moment, <PER>Harry</PER> felt a creeping chill behind <PER>Harry</PER> that could mean only one thing.
Wand!” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered frantically, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands flying over the ground like spiders.
<PER>Harry</PER> snatched it up, scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, and turned around.
Stumbling backward, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“Expecto Patronurrd” A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, <PER>Harry</PER> retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain — concentrate — A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s robes, reaching for him.
“Expecto PatronumV’ His voice sounded dim and distant Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand — His couldn’t do it anymore, His couldn’t work the spell — There was laughter inside His's own head, shrill, high- pitched laughter His could smell the dementor’s putrid, death-cold breath, filling His's own lungs, drowning His — Think something happy But there was no happiness in him The dementor’s icy fingers were closing on him's throat — the high- pitched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside him's head — “Bow to death, <PER>Harry</PER> It might even be painless I would not know I have never died” <PER>Harry</PER> was never going to see <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> again — And their faces burst clearly into his mind as his fought for breath — An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand; its antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood quite still, all <PER>Harry</PER>'s senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to normality.
After a moment <PER>Harry</PER> became aware that <PER>Harry</PER>'s T-shirt was sticking to he; he was drenched in sweat.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent down to see whether <PER>Harry</PER> was in a fit state to stand up, but then heard loud, running footsteps behind <PER>Harry</PER>; instinctively raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand again, <PER>Harry</PER> spun on <PER>Harry</PER>'s heel to face the newcomer.
<PER>Harry</PER> made to stow <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand hurriedly out of sight, but — “Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked.
“Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!” “You know <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at her.
“Of course I know <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who doesn’t know <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
“I’ll do it.” <PER>Harry</PER> took hold of <PER>Dudley</PER>’s arm and heaved: With an enormous effort <PER>Harry</PER> managed to hoist <PER>Dudley</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Dudley</PER> seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading His's face; the moment <PER>Harry</PER> let go of <PER>Harry</PER> swayed dangerously.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled one of <PER>Dudley</PER>’s massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under him's weight.
<PER>Harry</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER>'s cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but <PER>Dudley</PER> seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement.
<PER>Harry</PER> was slumped on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, <PER>Harry</PER>'s large feet dragging along the ground.
“Now come on, <PER>Harry</PER>, what are you waiting for?” <PER>Harry</PER> decided not to waste <PER>Harry</PER>'s remaining breath on pointing out that <PER>Harry</PER> could barely walk under <PER>Dudley</PER>’s bulk.
“Just in case there are more of them around Oh my word, what a catastrophe and you had to fight them off yourself and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs Well, it’s no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose but the cat’s among the pixies now ” “So,” <PER>Harry</PER> panted, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s been having me followed?” “Of course <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has,” said Mistress Figg impatiently.
“Wait!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted after her; <PER>Harry</PER> had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; but within seconds Mistress Figg was swallowed by the darkness.
Scowling, <PER>Harry</PER> readjusted <PER>Dudley</PER> on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number four’s garden path.
<PER>Harry</PER> stuck <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back inside the waistband of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia’s outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door.
With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, <PER>Harry</PER> removed <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys.
“Nothing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon wouldn’t believe <PER>Harry</PER>.
When <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t reply, <PER>Harry</PER> pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s just arrived at the Ministry, and <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s’s trying to sort it all out.
A small shoot of hope burgeoned in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest, almost immediately strangled by panic — how was <PER>Harry</PER> supposed to refuse to surrender <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand without doing magic?
he was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew that Mister Weasley had Mister Weasley's best interests at heart and, after all, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had sorted out much worse than this before “Right,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, “I’ve changed my mind, I’m staying.” <PER>Harry</PER> flung <PER>Harry</PER> down at the kitchen table and faced <PER>Dudley</PER> and Aunt Petunia.
“The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,” said <PER>Harry</PER> calmly; <PER>Harry</PER> was straining <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears to catch noises outside in case the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon’s questions than to have Uncle Vernon’s start raging and bellowing.
“That wasn’t me — ” “Was,” muttered <PER>Dudley</PER> unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at <PER>Harry</PER> to quiet <PER>Harry</PER> while they both bent low over <PER>Dudley</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> understood: <PER>Dudley</PER> was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you.
“If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use their names?” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, but Aunt Petunia ignored <PER>Harry</PER>.
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to <PER>Dudley</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER> as if hoping somebody was going to shout “April Fool!” When nobody did, he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright.
“Well, if that’s all,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
He was desperate to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, or Sirius.
“I want to know exactly what happened to my son!” “FINE!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, and in <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper, red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand, still clutched in his hand.
“<PER>Dudley</PER> and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, speaking fast, fighting to control <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper.
“ — a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house and I won’t have it, boy, I won’t — ” “I can’t stop the owls coming,” <PER>Harry</PER> snapped, crushing Sirius’s letter in <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist.
Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the dementors, had they deserted Azkaban and joined <PER>Voldemort</PER>, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had predicted they would?
“Then why — ?” “He must have sent them,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, more to <PER>Harry</PER> than to Uncle Vernon.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside down: The Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and Mistress Figg knew Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>; dementors were soaring around Little Whinging and Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might never go back to Hogwarts.
Aunt Petunia was looking at <PER>Harry</PER> as Aunt Petunia had never looked at <PER>Harry</PER> before.
And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, <PER>Harry</PER> fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s sister.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not have said why this hit <PER>Harry</PER> so very powerfully at this moment.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that <PER>Harry</PER> was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> being back might mean.
“I see,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from Uncle Vernon's white- faced wife to <PER>Harry</PER> and hitching up <PER>Harry</PER>'s trousers.
DO NOT LEA VE YOUR A UNT AND UNCLE’S “You heard me!” said Uncle Vernon, bending forward now, so that Uncle Vernon's massive purple face came closer to <PER>Harry</PER>’s, so that <PER>Harry</PER> actually felt flecks of spit hit <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> was watching <PER>Harry</PER>'s aunt, utterly bewildered, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head throbbing fit to burst.
He addressed the first to Sirius, the second to <PER>Ron</PER>, and the third to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head pounding, <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain too busy for sleep even though <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes stung and itched with tiredness.
<PER>Harry</PER> back ached from carrying <PER>Dudley</PER> home, and the two lumps on <PER>Harry</PER>'s head where the window and <PER>Dudley</PER> had hit him were throbbing painfully.
“Take these straight to Sirius, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> and don’t come back here without good long replies.
The moment She’d gone, <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> down onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling.
But he’d make it up to Hedwig's when Hedwig came back with Sirius’s, <PER>Ron</PER>’s, and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s answers.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent the day in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom.
Every time <PER>Harry</PER> heard her approaching <PER>Harry</PER> tried to question Aunt Petunia's about the Howler, but <PER>Harry</PER> might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers <PER>Harry</PER> got.
<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t see the point of forcing <PER>Harry</PER>'s company on them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps making <PER>Harry</PER> so angry <PER>Harry</PER>’d perform more illegal magic.
<PER>Harry</PER> was filled alternately with restless energy that made <PER>Harry</PER> unable to settle to anything, during which <PER>Harry</PER> paced <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them for leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete that <PER>Harry</PER> could lie on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.
Whenever this thought occurred, <PER>Harry</PER> invariably slid off <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and began pacing again.
On the fourth night after Hedwig’s departure <PER>Harry</PER> was lying in one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, <PER>Harry</PER>'s exhausted mind quite blank, when <PER>Harry</PER>'s uncle entered <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked slowly around at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Sorry?” “We — that is to say, your aunt, <PER>Dudley</PER>, and I — are going out.” “Fine,” said <PER>Harry</PER> dully, looking back at the ceiling.
“You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.” “Okay.” “You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions.” “Right.” “You are not to steal food from the fridge.” “Okay.” “I am going to lock your door.” “You do that.” Uncle Vernon glared at <PER>Harry</PER>, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom light.
The room grew steadily darker around <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> lay listening to the night sounds through the window <PER>Harry</PER> kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark upstairs landing, straining <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears for further sounds, but none came.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s room to the head of the stairs.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart shot upward into <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring at <PER>Harry</PER>, stowing <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand into the back pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans as <PER>Harry</PER> came.
“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning <PER>Harry</PER> toward the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing <PER>Harry</PER> curiously.
“Yeah, I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER> uncomfortably; it felt odd to be introduced to somebody <PER>Harry</PER>’d thought <PER>Harry</PER>’d known for a year.
<PER>Harry</PER> inclined <PER>Harry</PER>'s head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished they would look at something other than <PER>Harry</PER>; it was as though <PER>Harry</PER> had suddenly been ushered onstage.
“A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,” said Lupin, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had read <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind; the corners of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth twitched slightly.
Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, <PER>Harry</PER> had not bothered tidying up after <PER>Harry</PER>.
Most of the books <PER>Harry</PER> owned were strewn over the floor where <PER>Harry</PER>’d tried to distract <PER>Harry</PER> with each in turn and thrown it aside.
<PER>Harry</PER> started picking up books and throwing them hastily into <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk.
<PER>Harry</PER> followed her down the stairs carrying <PER>Harry</PER>'s broomstick.
“Come here, boy,” said Moody gruffly, beckoning <PER>Harry</PER> toward him with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s body, or rather, what had been <PER>Harry</PER>'s body, for it didn’t look anything like <PER>Harry</PER>'s anymore.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s right leg over <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt its vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more.
Tonks swerved and <PER>Harry</PER> followed her, watching <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom.
“We need more height Give it another quarter of a mile!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; <PER>Harry</PER>’s could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps.
Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon’s car The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition and <PER>Harry</PER> laughed aloud at the thought, though <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice was drowned by the flapping of the others’ robes, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air.
“We’ll get soaked, Mad-Eye!” <PER>Harry</PER> was relieved to hear her say this; <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands were growing numb on the Firebolt’s handle.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had thought to put on a coat; <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to shiver.
“We want to avoid the motorway!” <PER>Harry</PER> was now so chilled that <PER>Harry</PER> thought longingly for a moment of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight Now Emmeline Vance was on his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right then her too swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore “We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure We’re not being followed!” Moody shouted.
“Follow Tonks, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> followed Tonks into a dive.
“Wait till we’re inside!” He pulled the piece of parchment out of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and set fire to the piece of parchment with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand tip.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought, and no sooner had <PER>Harry</PER> reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and saw the others filing in behind <PER>Harry</PER>, Lupin and Tonks carrying <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk and Hedwig’s cage.
“Here — ” He rapped <PER>Harry</PER> hard over the head with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand; <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though something hot was trickling down <PER>Harry</PER>'s back this time and knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.
She was beaming in welcome as She hurried toward them, though <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that She was rather thinner and paler than She had been last time <PER>Harry</PER> had seen She.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s lovely to see you!” She whispered, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> into a rib-cracking hug before holding <PER>Harry</PER> at arm’s length and examining <PER>Harry</PER> critically.
“You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid” She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently, “him’s just arrived, the meeting’s started” The wizards behind <PER>Harry</PER> all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past <PER>Harry</PER> toward the door through which Molly had just come; <PER>Harry</PER> made to follow Lupin, but Molly held <PER>Harry</PER> back.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s bewilderment deepened with every step <PER>Harry</PER> took.
“Molly, why — ?” “<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to dash,” Molly whispered distractedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair — <PER>Hermione</PER> had thrown — <PER>Hermione</PER> onto him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat, while <PER>Ron</PER>’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round and round their heads.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, still beaming, let go of <PER>Harry</PER>, but before <PER>Hermione</PER> could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> was going spare, <PER>Hermione</PER> kept saying you’d do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> made us — ” “ — swear not to tell me,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid month — he felt he would rather <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left he alone.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I mean.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yeah?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyebrows.
“Have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer?” “Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time — ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great jolt in <PER>Harry</PER>'s guts as though <PER>Harry</PER> had just missed a step going downstairs.
So everyone had known <PER>Harry</PER> was being followed except <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Didn’t work that well, though, did it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, doing <PER>Harry</PER>'s utmost to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice even.
“If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t have done magic and “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.” “Aren’t you aren’t you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked away from them, looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his spirits.
“So why’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> been so keen to keep me in the dark?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, still trying hard to keep <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice casual.
“Did you — er — bother to ask <PER>Harry</PER> at all?” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was behaving just as them had feared <PER>Harry</PER> would.
“We told <PER>Dumbledore</PER> We wanted to tell you what was going on,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You’re not telling me he doesn’t know ways to send messages without owls.” <PER>Hermione</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER> and then said, “I thought that too.
Every bitter and resentful thought that <PER>Harry</PER> had had in the past month was pouring out of <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER>'s frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been together without <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s fury at being followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries.
<PER>Ron</PER> was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say, while <PER>Hermione</PER> looked on the verge of tears.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, we wanted to tell you, we really did — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER> did — ” “we wanted to — ” “No, honest — ” <PER>Harry</PER>, we’re really sorry!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> desperately, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes now sparkling with tears.
“You’re absolutely right, <PER>Harry</PER> — I’d be furious if it was me!” <PER>Harry</PER> glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again, pacing up and down.
“What is this place anyway?” he shot at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s in charge, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> founded it.
“Quite a few people — ” “ — we’ve met about twenty of them,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “but we think there are more” <PER>Harry</PER> glared at them.
“Well what?” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>i” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously, and both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> winced.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked around the room again, looking anywhere but at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Stop doing that!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly red-haired as <PER>Ron</PER>, though stockier and slightly shorter.
“Oh hello, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s younger sister, <PER>Ginny</PER>, brightly.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure <PER>Harry</PER>'s anger had abated yet; but <PER>Harry</PER>'s thirst for information was now overcoming <PER>Harry</PER>'s urge to keep shouting.
“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s still in Romania, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s still in Romania trying to make contacts on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s still in Romania's days off.” “Couldn’t Percy do that?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> in a tense voice.
“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s friendly with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and he’s always thought Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle obsession — ” “But what’s this got to do with Percy?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, confused.
“He’s not stupid, He must know your mum and dad wouldn’t risk everything without proof — ” “Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, shooting <PER>Harry</PER> a furtive look.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hurried on, “Well, you’d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they — um — they mention you a couple of times a week.” “But I’d have seen — ” “Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn’t,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, shaking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
“They’re just building on <PER>Rita</PER>’s stuff.” “But <PER>Rita</PER>’s not writing for them anymore, is she?” “Oh no, <PER>Rita</PER>’s kept <PER>Rita</PER>'s promise — not that <PER>Rita</PER>’s got any choice,” <PER>Hermione</PER> added with satisfaction.
“But <PER>Hermione</PER> laid the foundation for what they’re trying to do now.” “Which is what?” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently.
“Okay, you know <PER>Hermione</PER> wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, who was not likely to forget <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter’s stories about him in a hurry.
“Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a great tragic hero or something,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for <PER>Harry</PER> to hear these facts quickly.
“<PER>Harry</PER> loves playing with them.” “Oh,” said Molly, “I thought it might have been Kreacher, <PER>Harry</PER> keeps doing odd things like that.
Both of them were watching <PER>Harry</PER> apprehensively, as though Both of Both of Both of them feared that <PER>Harry</PER> would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone.
“Look ” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, but <PER>Ron</PER> shook his head, and <PER>Hermione</PER> said quietly, “We knew you’d be angry, <PER>Harry</PER>, We really don’t blame you, but you’ve got to understand, We did try and persuade <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ” “Yeah, I know,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grudgingly.
<PER>Harry</PER> cast around for a topic to change the subject from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — the very thought of <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>’s insides burn with anger again.
“He’s not a nutter, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “His life’s ambition is to have His's head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like His's mother,” said <PER>Ron</PER> irritably.
“Is that normal, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “Well — well, if he is a bit strange, it’s not his fault — ” <PER>Ron</PER> rolled his eyes at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> still hasn’t given up on spew — ” “It’s not ‘spew’!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> heatedly.
“It’s the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s not just me, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says we should be kind to Kreacher too — ” “Yeah, yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“C’mon, I’m starving.” He led the way out of the door and onto the landing, but before they could descend the stairs — “Hold it!” <PER>Ron</PER> breathed, flinging out an arm to stop <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> walking any farther.
In the very center of the group <PER>Harry</PER> saw the dark, greasy-haired head and prominent nose of his least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very interested in what <PER>Snape</PER> was doing for the Order of the Phoenix A thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes.
“<PER>Snape</PER> never eats here,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> was looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she was being tortured — then <PER>Harry</PER> realized it was simply a life-size portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
The old woman was drooling, The old woman's eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin of The old woman's face stretched taut as The old woman screamed, and all along the hall behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that <PER>Harry</PER> actually screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes at the noise and clapped <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands over <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears.
“Good to see you!” Over him's shoulder <PER>Harry</PER> saw Bill, who still wore shoulder <PER>Harry</PER>'s long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s arrived.” “Eh?” said Mundungus, peering balefully at <PER>Harry</PER> through his matted ginger hair.
<PER>Harry</PER> was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking mournfully at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I haven’t seen anyone.” “See, I wouldn’t ’ave left,” said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in his voice, “but I ’ad a business opportunity — ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt something brush against <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around <PER>Harry</PER>’s legs, purring, then jumped onto Sirius’s lap and curled up.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a sudden upsurge of affection for <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather.
“Listening to <PER>Snape</PER>’s reports, having to take all <PER>Snape</PER>'s snide hints that <PER>Snape</PER>’s out there risking <PER>Snape</PER>'s life while I’m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time asking me how the cleaning’s going — ” “What cleaning?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard the sarcasm in <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure that anyone else did.
Opposite <PER>Harry</PER>, Tonks was entertaining <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> by transforming her nose between mouthfuls.
Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression her had worn back in <PER>Harry</PER>’s bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like <PER>Snape</PER>’s, shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril.
Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> started requesting their favorite noses.
“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks ” Tonks obliged, and <PER>Harry</PER>, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female <PER>Dudley</PER> was grinning at him from across the table.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked round at <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather.
“Knows all the crooks — well, <PER>Harry</PER> would, seeing as <PER>Harry</PER>’s one himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay down <PER>Harry</PER>'s spoon in a lull in the general conversation.
“I asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> said we’re not allowed in the Order, so — ” “And <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’re quite right,” said Molly.
“How come <PER>Harry</PER> gets <PER>Harry</PER>'s questions answered?” said Fred angrily.
“The bit about not telling <PER>Harry</PER> more than <PER>Harry</PER> needs to know,” said Molly, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, and George’s heads turned from Sirius to Molly as though following a tennis rally.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with <PER>Ginny</PER>'s mouth slightly open.
“But as he was the one who saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> come back” (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), “<PER>Voldemort</PER> has more right than most to — ” “<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Molly.
“Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> keeps reminding you to stay at home and — ” “We’ll leave my instructions from <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out of this, if you please!” said Sirius loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been touched by what Molly had said about <PER>Harry</PER>'s being as good as a son, but <PER>Harry</PER> was also impatient at Molly's mollycoddling Sirius was right, he was not a child.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — <PER>Ron</PER> — <PER>Hermione</PER> — Fred — George — I want you out of this kitchen, now.” There was instant uproar.
“If <PER>Harry</PER>’s allowed, why can’t I?” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>’ll tell me and <PER>Hermione</PER> everything you say anyway!” said <PER>Ron</PER> hotly.
For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> considered telling <PER>Ron</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t tell <PER>Harry</PER> a single word, that <PER>Harry</PER> could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how <PER>Harry</PER> liked it.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> beamed.
“Okay, <PER>Harry</PER> what do you want to know?” <PER>Harry</PER> took a deep breath and asked the question that had been obsessing <PER>Harry</PER> for a month.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Voldemort</PER> had murdered more than once in the last year alone.
“And you made sure <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew at once.” “How has that helped?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was the only one <PER>Voldemort</PER> was ever scared of!” “Thanks to you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned,” said Sirius.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.” “So what does <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reckon <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s planning?” “Well, firstly, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants to build up <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s army again,” said Sirius.
“You saw <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge after <PER>Voldemort</PER> came back, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “Fudge is frightened of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, you see,” said Tonks sadly.
“Frightened of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> incredulously.
“You see, Fudge thinks <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s plotting to overthrow <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“How can he think <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would just make it all up — that I’d make it all up?” “Because accepting that <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn’t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,” said Sirius bitterly.
“Why d’you think <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s in such trouble?” “What d’you mean?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> doesn’t march up to people’s houses and bang on their front doors, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Sirius.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not noticed her return from taking <PER>Ginny</PER> upstairs.
“If <PER>Ginny</PER>’s not lying awake waiting for <PER>Hermione</PER> to tell <PER>Hermione</PER>'s everything they said downstairs, then I’m a flobberworm” “All right, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Molly on the second landing, pointing them into them's bedroom.
“Off to bed with you.” “ ’Night,” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> said to the twins.
<PER>Harry</PER> put on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas, took off <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses, and climbed into <PER>Harry</PER>'s chilly bed while <PER>Ron</PER> threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Harry</PER>'s outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window.
“What d’you reckon?” <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t need to ask what <PER>Ron</PER> meant.
“Keep your voice down, <PER>Ron</PER>, or Mum’ll be back up here.” “You two just Apparated on my knees!” “Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark — ” <PER>Harry</PER> saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed.
“He doesn’t need anything more efficient than that.” There was a pause and <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the others, like <PER>Harry</PER>, were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.
“Look at <PER>Ginny</PER>.” “What d’you mean?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mum,” said George, and without further ado there was a loud crack and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the weight vanish from the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to think about that <PER>Harry</PER> fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to continue talking to <PER>Ron</PER>, but Molly was now creaking back downstairs again, and once Molly had gone <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly heard others making others's way upstairs In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, “Beauties, aren’ they, eh, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then Mum needs you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxies than Mum thought and Mum’s found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.” Half an hour later, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, who had dressed and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive- green walls covered in dirty tapestries.
It was around these that Molly, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Fred, and George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths.
“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Molly said to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> the moment ” Molly saw <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table.
<PER>Harry</PER> took as much time as <PER>Harry</PER> dared to close the drawing room door; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs.
He heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a deep voice He recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s just relieved me, so she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave a report for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>” Feeling Molly’s eyes on the back of his head, <PER>Harry</PER> regretfully closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party.
“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snack-boxes,” George told <PER>Harry</PER> under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath.
Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his nose, <PER>Harry</PER> moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, “What are Skiving Snackboxes?” “Range of sweets to make you ill,” George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Molly’s back.
“Joke shop still on, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on <PER>Harry</PER>'s spray.
They were crammed with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages <PER>Harry</PER> could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure was blood.
and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my Mistress knew, oh how my Mistress’d cry, and there’s a new boy, Kreacher doesn’t know Kreacher's name, what is Kreacher doing here, Kreacher doesn’t know ” “This is <PER>Harry</PER>, Kreacher,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” Kreacher’s pale eyes widened and <PER>Harry</PER> muttered faster and more furiously than ever.
“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would Kreacher’s Mistress say — ” “Don’t call Kreacher’s Mistress's a Mudblood!” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> together, very angrily.
“It doesn’t matter,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, “he’s not in his right mind, he doesn’t know what he’s — ” “Don’t kid yourself, <PER>Hermione</PER>, he knows exactly what he’s saying,” said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.
“Sirius, he’s not right in the head,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> pleadingly, “I don’t think he realizes we can hear he.” “he’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad orders from my mother’s portrait and talking to himself, but himself was always a foul little — ” “If you just set he free,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hopefully, “maybe — ” “We can’t set he free, he knows too much about the Order,” said Sirius curtly.
“I’d had enough.” “Where did you go?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, did not laugh; <PER>Harry</PER> was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda’s burn mark.
A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa Black with <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name <PER>Draco</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> curiously.
“Rodolphus ’s brother, Rabastan, was with Rodolphus ’s brother, Rabastan too.” And <PER>Harry</PER> remembered: <PER>Harry</PER> had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>, her pride that her had tried to find him after him's downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for shis loyalty.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew how <PER>Harry</PER> would feel if forced, when <PER>Harry</PER> was grown up and thought <PER>Harry</PER> was free of the place forever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up and realized that Sirius had been watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried <PER>Harry</PER>'s best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass cabinets that afternoon.
“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, “must be Wartcap powder in there.” He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; <PER>Harry</PER> saw George wrap <PER>Harry</PER>'s own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into George's already doxy-filled pocket.
They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm like a spider when <PER>Harry</PER> picked it up, and attempted to puncture <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin; Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy.
<PER>Snape</PER> might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in <PER>Harry</PER>’s opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher.
Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said, “Master must do as Master wishes,” before turning away and muttering very loudly, “but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against <PER>Voldemort</PER>, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum” At which Sirius, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>’s protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.
<PER>Snape</PER> flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to <PER>Harry</PER>’s relief they never came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though she also seemed too busy to linger.
As long as <PER>Harry</PER> was busy <PER>Harry</PER> was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever <PER>Harry</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him.
The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not mentioning it.
<PER>Harry</PER> nodded and tried to keep eating <PER>Harry</PER>'s chops, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth had become so dry <PER>Harry</PER> could not chew.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over at Sirius, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could ask the question, Molly had answered it.
“When did <PER>Dumbledore</PER> tell you that?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, staring at Sirius.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s own eyes to <PER>Harry</PER>'s plate.
The thought that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been in the house on the eve of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hearing and not asked to see <PER>Dumbledore</PER> made <PER>Dumbledore</PER> feel, if that were possible, even worse.
<PER>Harry</PER> awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear.
For a few moments <PER>Harry</PER> lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain, then, unable to bear it, <PER>Harry</PER> leapt out of bed and put on <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses.
Trying not to think of the next time his would see <PER>Ron</PER>, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER> walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the door <PER>Harry</PER> heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and when <PER>Harry</PER> pushed it open <PER>Harry</PER> saw Mister and Molly, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for <PER>Harry</PER>.
Lupin glanced at <PER>Harry</PER>, then said to Tonks, “What were you saying about Scrimgeour?” “Oh yeah well, we need to be a bit more careful, he’s been asking Kingsley and me funny questions” <PER>Harry</PER> felt vaguely grateful that <PER>Harry</PER> was not required to join in the conversation.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“We’re a bit early, but I think you’ll be better off there than hanging around here.” “Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> automatically, dropping <PER>Harry</PER>'s toast and getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“You’ll be all right, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Tonks, patting <PER>Harry</PER> on the arm.
“You don’t normally walk to work, do you?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Harry</PER>, as they set off briskly around the square.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew it was clenched around <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“Four stops, <PER>Harry</PER> three stops left now two stops to go, <PER>Harry</PER> ” They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases.
“Where are we?” said Arthur blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment <PER>Harry</PER> thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Arthur’s continual references to the map; but a second later <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Ah yes this way, <PER>Harry</PER>,” and led him down a side road.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked it up: It was a square silver badge with <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it.
<PER>Harry</PER> pinned it to the front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> could see nothing at all; <PER>Harry</PER> could only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made the telephone box way down through the earth.
As they passed the fountain <PER>Harry</PER> saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at <PER>Harry</PER> from the bottom of the pool.
A small, smudged sign beside it read: All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten Galleons, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> thinking desperately.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked closer to <PER>Harry</PER> and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down <PER>Harry</PER>’s front and back.
His eyes had darted from the silver visitor’s badge on <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest to <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
“Thank you, Eric,” said Arthur firmly, and grasping <PER>Harry</PER> by the shoulder, Arthur steered <PER>Harry</PER> away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates.
<PER>Harry</PER> and Arthur joined the crowd around one of <PER>Harry</PER> and Arthur.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> jammed against the back wall of the lift.
Several witches and wizards were looking at <PER>Harry</PER> curiously; <PER>Harry</PER> stared at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet to avoid catching anyone’s eye, flattening <PER>Harry</PER>'s fringe as <PER>Harry</PER> did so.
<PER>Harry</PER> stared up at them as them flapped idly around above <PER>Harry</PER>'s head; them were a pale violet color and <PER>Harry</PER> could see MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the edges of them's wings.
“I’ve been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?” “Yes, if it really is a second,” said Arthur, “I’m in rather a hurry.” They were talking to each other as though They hardly knew each other, and when <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Arthur stood on Arthur's foot.
<PER>Harry</PER> received a slight shock; Sirius’s face was blinking down at <PER>Harry</PER> from every direction.
“And I’m afraid you’ll have to wait for information on motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the moment.” He dropped He's voice and said, “If you can get away before seven, Molly’s making meatballs.” He beckoned to <PER>Harry</PER> and led <PER>Harry</PER> out of Kingsley’s cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading MISUSE OF MUGGLE Arthur’s dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard.
“Quick, <PER>Harry</PER>, we should have been there five minutes ago!” Perkins flattened Perkins against the filing cabinets as Arthur left the office at a run, <PER>Harry</PER> on <PER>Harry</PER>'s heels.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> had left all <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides back at Perkins’s desk.
“Of course.” <PER>Harry</PER> barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s unfaltering gaze did not make <PER>Harry</PER> feel any more comfortable.
<PER>Harry</PER> gasped; <PER>Harry</PER> could not help <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from <PER>Harry</PER>, but none came.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> drew level with <PER>Harry</PER> and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down <PER>Harry</PER>'s very crooked nose.
A powerful emotion had risen in <PER>Harry</PER>’s chest at the sight of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave <PER>Harry</PER>.
He wanted to catch <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s eye, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was not looking He's way; He was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge.
“However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.” “Yes — well — I suppose well need another chair — I — Weasley, could you — ?” “Not to worry, not to worry,” said “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> pleasantly; ““<PER>Dumbledore</PER> took out ““<PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat down, put the tips of “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest.
“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “because — ” “A corporeal Patronus?” “A — what?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cleared <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s throat.
he stared down at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling he back together, said, “We haven’t got time to listen to more taradiddles, I’m afraid, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood up and gave Mistress Figg <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s chair, conjuring a second one for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I have already given you my views on this matter, <PER>Cornelius</PER>.” “Yes, you have,” said Fudge forcefully, “and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took <PER>Harry</PER> aback; <PER>Harry</PER> had been expecting a croak.
“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>'s cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> politely.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> inclined <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s head in a little bow.
“We are here to examine <PER>Harry</PER> Potter’s offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery!” “Of course we are,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant.
“Then we are in agreement that <PER>Harry</PER>’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes?” “If there were dementors, which I doubt — ” “You have heard from an eyewitness,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> interrupted.
“It’s — I want this over with today, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“And I haven’t even started on what his gets up to at school — ” “ — but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school, <PER>Harry</PER>’s behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words.
“As far as I am aware, however,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> continued, “there is no law yet in place that says this court’s job is to punish <PER>Harry</PER> for every bit of magic <PER>Harry</PER> has ever performed.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, seeking reassurance; <PER>Harry</PER> was not at all sure that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a decision.
Again, however, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed oblivious to <PER>Harry</PER>’s attempt to catch <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart, which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not at all sure that <PER>Harry</PER> had made a good impression.
<PER>Harry</PER> ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how <PER>Harry</PER> had fallen over, about how both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dudley</PER> had nearly been kissed Twice <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at Fudge and opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to speak, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s swollen heart was now constricting <PER>Harry</PER>'s air passages and both times <PER>Harry</PER> merely took a deep breath and looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoes.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to look up at the judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining <PER>Harry</PER>'s laces.
his took two deep breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, “Very well, very well cleared of all charges.” “Excellent,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> briskly, springing to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet, pulling out <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s abrupt departure took <PER>Harry</PER> completely by surprise.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained sitting where <PER>Harry</PER> was in the chained chair, struggling with <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings of shock and relief.
Nobody seemed to be paying <PER>Harry</PER> the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s right, who was now gazing down at <PER>Harry</PER> instead of at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Ignoring her, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting to ask whether <PER>Harry</PER> was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice <PER>Harry</PER>, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so <PER>Harry</PER> took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody called <PER>Harry</PER> back, broke into a very fast walk.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t say — ” “Cleared,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, pulling the door closed behind <PER>Harry</PER>, “of all charges!” Beaming, Arthur seized <PER>Harry</PER> by the shoulders.
“Merlin’s beard,” said Arthur wonderingly, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> aside to let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?” “I think so,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge acted as though Arthur and <PER>Harry</PER> were part of the wall, but again, the toadlike witch looked almost appraisingly at <PER>Harry</PER> as she passed.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt winded, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had just walked into something heavy.
<PER>Harry</PER> had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death Eater’s hood, and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> tortured him.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not believe that <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> dared look <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> in the face; <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> could not believe that <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge was talking to <PER>Harry</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> had told Fudge mere weeks ago that <PER>Malfoy</PER> was a Death Eater.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “yeah, I’m good at escaping” <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> raised ” <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyes to Arthur’s face.
“Not here, surely?” said Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>, raising Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s eyebrows and glancing toward the door over Mister Weasley’s shoulder.
“What are you doing here anyway?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“I don’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, smoothing the front of his robes; <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold.
“Really, just because you are <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s favorite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?” “Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on <PER>Harry</PER> and Arthur.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s been giving generously to all sorts of things for years Gets him in with the right people then him can ask favors delay laws him doesn’t want passed Oh, him’s very well connected, <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>” The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around Arthur’s head as Arthur’s pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors clanged shut; Arthur’s waved them away irritably.
“Arthur,” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly, “if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like <PER>Malfoy</PER>, if <PER>Harry</PER>’s seeing them alone, how do we know them haven’t put the Imperius Curse on him?” “Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, <PER>Harry</PER>,” muttered Arthur.
“But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thinks Fudge is acting of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own accord at the moment — which, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says, is not a lot of comfort Best not talk about it anymore just now, <PER>Harry</PER>” The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted Atrium.
Arthur looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> looked rather weak and foolish.
With a grin at the thought of what <PER>Hermione</PER> would say if <PER>Hermione</PER> could see the statue of the elf, <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s money bag upside down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues’ feet.
“You always get away with stuff!” “They were bound to clear you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had looked positively faint with anxiety when <PER>Harry</PER> had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes.
“Listen, Sirius, <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was at the Ministry — ” “What?” said Sirius sharply.
“<PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> got off <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> got off <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> got off — ” “Be quiet, you three!
“We’ll tell <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, don’t worry.” “Well, I’d better get going, there’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal Green waiting for me.
“<PER>Harry</PER> dear, come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than themselves had done since him had first arrived at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s feeling of giddy relief, which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, swelled again.
“ ’Course, once <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you,” said <PER>Ron</PER> happily, now dishing great mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates.
“But it’s nothing It happens all the time now” None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping them to food while gloating over <PER>Harry</PER>’s narrow escape; Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were still singing.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather anxious, but before <PER>Hermione</PER> could say anything, <PER>Ron</PER> said happily, “I bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.” “I don’t think he’ll be able to, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said Molly, setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Over the next few days <PER>Harry</PER> could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly overjoyed that <PER>Harry</PER> would be returning to Hogwarts.
Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand and beaming just like the rest of them; soon, however, <PER>Harry</PER> was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to everybody, even <PER>Harry</PER>, and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s room with Buckbeak.
“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sternly, after <PER>Harry</PER> had confided some of <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER> while they scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later.
“You know, maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time — we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds — ” “I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” <PER>Ron</PER> muttered irritably, but only so <PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached; <PER>Harry</PER> could not wait to see <PER>Hagrid</PER> again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses.
The fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-<PER>Voldemort</PER> movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as <PER>Harry</PER> would have expected before <PER>Harry</PER>’d experienced it.
Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few minutes’ whispered conversation, Molly made sure that <PER>Harry</PER> and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that <PER>Harry</PER> needed to know anything more than <PER>Harry</PER> had heard on the night of <PER>Harry</PER>'s arrival.
On the very last day of the holidays <PER>Harry</PER> was sweeping up Hedwig’s owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when <PER>Ron</PER> entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.
“About time, I thought they’d forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this” <PER>Harry</PER> swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw a rubbish bag over <PER>Ron</PER>’s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly.
“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,” Fred told <PER>Harry</PER>, “and from what they were saying, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.” “Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s happened to the last four?” said George.
“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in a trunk for nine months,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, counting them off on <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers.
<PER>Ron</PER> was standing very still with <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth slightly open, gaping at <PER>Harry</PER>'s letter from Hogwarts.
“No one in their right mind would make <PER>Ron</PER> a prefect” The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them stared at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Prefect ickle <PER>Ron</PER>nie the prefect ” “Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge back at <PER>Ron</PER> as though it might contaminate him.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a moment, and then held it out to <PER>Harry</PER> as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine.
<PER>Hermione</PER> came tearing into the room, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cheeks flushed and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair flying.
“Me too, <PER>Harry</PER>, me too!” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, pushing the badge back into <PER>Ron</PER>’s hand.
“It’s <PER>Ron</PER>, not me.” “It — what?” “<PER>Ron</PER>’s prefect, not me,” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“<PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her jaw dropping.
“No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, blushing harder than ever, “no, it’s not <PER>Ron</PER>’s done loads of <PER>Ron</PER>’s’s really ” The door behind her opened a little wider and Mistress Weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> said the booklists had come at last,” <PER>Ginny</PER> said, glancing around at all the envelopes as <PER>Ginny</PER> made <PER>Ginny</PER>'s way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles.
“His but <PER>Ron</PER>, you’re not ?” <PER>Ron</PER> held up his badge.
“He could if you don’t watch out!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily, at which Fred and George burst out laughing and <PER>Ron</PER> muttered, “Drop it, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “We’re going to have to watch We step, George,” said Fred, pretending to tremble, “with these two on We case” “Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,” said George, shaking George's head.
“Don’t pay any attention to them, <PER>Ron</PER>, they’re only jealous!” “I don’t think they are,” said <PER>Ron</PER> doubtfully, also looking up at the ceiling.
For some reason, <PER>Harry</PER> found that <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to look at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Molly had laid upon it, and crossed the room to <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively.
“Well done,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, so heartily it did not sound like <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice at all, and still not looking at her.
A few moments passed; <PER>Harry</PER> heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds <PER>Harry</PER> could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.
<PER>Harry</PER> straightened up and looked behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> returned slowly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and sank onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe.
<PER>Harry</PER> screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s face and buried it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
Did this make He as arrogant as <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered, anxiously probing <PER>Harry</PER>'s own feelings.
That was definitely true, <PER>Harry</PER> thought; <PER>Harry</PER> was no better than <PER>Ron</PER> in lessons.
What about those adventures he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had had together since they had started at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?
Well, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were with me most of the time, said the voice in <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
Not all the time, though, <PER>Harry</PER> argued with <PER>Harry</PER>.
They weren’t in that graveyard with me, the night <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned And the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed <PER>Voldemort</PER> on the night <PER>Voldemort</PER> had arrived rose again.
I’ve done more than either of them\ But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe <PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t choose prefects because they’ve got they into a load of dangerous situations <PER>Dumbledore</PER> chooses them for other reasons <PER>Ron</PER> must have something you don’t <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and stared through <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers at the wardrobe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.
“No one in their right mind would make <PER>Ron</PER> a prefect” <PER>Harry</PER> gave a small snort of laughter.
<PER>Ron</PER> had not asked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> to give <PER>Dumbledore</PER> the prefect badge.
Was he, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>’s best friend in the world, going to sulk because he didn’t have a badge, laugh with the twins behind <PER>Ron</PER>’s back, ruin this for <PER>Ron</PER> when, for the first time, he had beaten <PER>Harry</PER> at something?
At this point <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER>’s footsteps on the stairs again.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood up, straightened <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses, and hitched a grin onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s face as <PER>Ron</PER> bounded back through the door.
“her says her’ll get the Cleansweep if her can.” “Cool,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER> was relieved to hear that <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice had stopped sounding hearty.
“Listen — <PER>Ron</PER> — well done, mate.” The smile faded off <PER>Ron</PER>’s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Ron</PER> kept moving <PER>Harry</PER>'s prefect’s badge around, first placing it on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, then putting it into <PER>Harry</PER>'s jeans pocket, then taking it out and laying it on <PER>Harry</PER>'s folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black.
“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,” she told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> as they entered the room.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at <PER>Harry</PER> and moved away toward Sirius and Lupin.
“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at <PER>Ron</PER> with his normal eye, “authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t have appointed you” <PER>Ron</PER> looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s father and eldest brother.
“To <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, the new Gryffindor prefects!” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded.
<PER>Ginny</PER> laughed; <PER>Hermione</PER> looked as though <PER>Ginny</PER> did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it.
“What about you, Sirius?” <PER>Ginny</PER> asked, thumping <PER>Hermione</PER> on the back.
Sirius, who was right beside <PER>Harry</PER>, let out <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual barklike laugh.
All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; <PER>Harry</PER> father loaded up <PER>Harry</PER> father's plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room.
When you think the Comet Two Ninety’s only naught to sixty and that’s with a decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick?” <PER>Hermione</PER> was talking very earnestly to Lupin about <PER>Hermione</PER>'s view of elf rights.
getting really out of hand, and you’re so good- looking, it would look much better shorter, wouldn’t it, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Oh — I dunno — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, slightly alarmed at being asked <PER>Harry</PER>'s opinion; <PER>Harry</PER> slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.
Mundungus stopped talking when Mundungus saw <PER>Harry</PER>, but Fred winked and beckoned <PER>Harry</PER> closer.
“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust <PER>Harry</PER>, he’s we financial backer.” “Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding out his hand to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect <PER>Ron</PER>, we’re okay.” “But Moody could have Moody's eye on you,” <PER>Harry</PER> pointed out.
Would Molly still feel that <PER>Harry</PER> was as good as Would Molly's son if she found out <PER>Harry</PER> had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable?
Standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of him's stomach for company, <PER>Harry</PER> caught the sound of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own name.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’ll have had <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s reasons,” replied Lupin.
<PER>Harry</PER> set down <PER>Harry</PER>'s plate and wondered whether <PER>Harry</PER> could follow her without attracting attention.
A small crowd of people, some waving at <PER>Harry</PER>, others lifting others's glasses, looked back up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him, strange bloke That’s Dorcas Meadowes, <PER>Voldemort</PER> killed her personally Sirius, when he still had short hair and there you go, thought that would interest you!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart turned over.
<PER>Harry</PER> mother and father were beaming up at <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man <PER>Harry</PER> recognized at once as Wormtail: <PER>Harry</PER> was the one who had betrayed their whereabouts to <PER>Voldemort</PER> and so helped bring about their deaths.
Evidently Moody’s was under the impression <PER>Harry</PER> had just given <PER>Harry</PER> a bit of a treat.
<PER>Harry</PER> crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call <PER>Harry</PER> back.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know why <PER>Harry</PER> had received such a shock; <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ pictures before, after all, and <PER>Harry</PER> had met Wormtail but to have them sprung on <PER>Harry</PER> like that, when <PER>Harry</PER> was least expecting it No one would like that, He thought angrily And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into madness all waving happily out of the photograph forevermore, not knowing that they were doomed Well, Moody might find that interesting he, <PER>Harry</PER>, found it disturbing <PER>Harry</PER> tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf heads, glad to be on <PER>Harry</PER>'s own again, but as <PER>Harry</PER> approached the first landing <PER>Harry</PER> heard noises.
All the air seemed to vanish from <PER>Harry</PER>’s lungs; he felt as though he were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold — <PER>Ron</PER> dead, no, it couldn’t be But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — <PER>Ron</PER> was downstairs — “Molly?” <PER>Harry</PER> croaked.
Dead <PER>Harry</PER> “Molly, just get out of here!” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>, staring down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own dead body on the floor.
“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about time you got used to hearing it — look, I can’t promise no one’s going to get hurt, nobody can promise that, but we’re much better off than we were last time, you weren’t in the Order then, you don’t understand, last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking we off one by one” <PER>Harry</PER> thought of the photograph again, of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents’ beaming faces.
“And as for who’s going to look after <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> if you and Arthur died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, “what do you think we’d do, let them starve?” Molly smiled tremulously.
But <PER>Harry</PER>, closing <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom door behind <PER>Harry</PER> some ten minutes later, could not think Molly silly.
<PER>Harry</PER> could still see <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents beaming up at <PER>Harry</PER> from the tattered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so many of those around their, were drawing to a close.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt older than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever felt in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, and it seemed extraordinary to <PER>Harry</PER> that barely an hour ago <PER>Harry</PER> had been worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge.
<PER>Harry</PER> parents wove in and out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s dreams, never speaking; Mistress Weasley sobbed over Kreacher’s dead body watched by <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were wearing crowns, and yet again <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> walking down a corridor ending in a locked door.
<PER>Harry</PER> awoke abruptly with <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar prickling to find <PER>Ron</PER> already dressed and talking to <PER>Harry</PER>. "
From what he heard as he dressed at top speed, <PER>Harry</PER> gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that them had hurtled straight into <PER>Ginny</PER> and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mistress Black and Molly were both screaming at the top of their voices.
<PER>Hermione</PER> came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as <PER>Harry</PER> was putting on <PER>Harry</PER>'s trainers; Hedwig was swaying on Hedwig's shoulder, and Hedwig was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in Hedwig's arms.
“Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back” — the owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of Hedwig's cage — “are you ready yet?” “Nearly — <PER>Ginny</PER> all right?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, shoving on <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses.
“I thought <PER>Voldemort</PER> was supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in?” “I don’t know, it’s just what Mad-Eye says,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> distractedly, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch.
<PER>Harry</PER> seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage, and set off downstairs after <PER>Hermione</PER>, dragging his trunk.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re to come with me and Tonks,” shouted Molly over the repeated screeches of “MUDBLOODSl SCUM CREATURES OF DIRV.” “Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with the luggage Oh, for heaven’s sake, Sirius, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said no!” A bearlike black dog had appeared at <PER>Harry</PER>’s side as <PER>Harry</PER> clambered over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Molly.
<PER>Harry</PER> inhaled the familiar smell and felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s spirits soar <PER>Harry</PER> was really going back “I hope the others make it in time,” said Molly anxiously, staring behind Molly's at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which new arrivals would come.
“Don’t think we were followed” Seconds later, Arthur emerged onto the platform with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
he reached <PER>Harry</PER> last and gave <PER>Harry</PER> a clap on the shoulder.
“Write Be good If you’ve forgotten anything we’ll send it on Onto the train, now, hurry” For one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto the great black dog hind legs and placed the great black dog front paws on <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulders, but Molly shoved <PER>Harry</PER> away toward the train door hissing, “For heaven’s sake act more like a dog, Sirius!” “See you!” <PER>Harry</PER> called out of the open window as the train began to move, while <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> waved beside him.
“Shall we go and find a compartment, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged looks.
“We’re — well — <PER>Ron</PER> and I are supposed to go into the prefect carriage,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said awkwardly.
<PER>Ron</PER> wasn’t looking at <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on <PER>Harry</PER>'s left hand.
“Well, I-I might see you later, then.” “Yeah, definitely,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, casting a shifty, anxious look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I know you’re not,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> grinned.
But as <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off toward the engine end of the train, <PER>Harry</PER> felt an odd sense of loss.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Come on,” <PER>Ginny</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, “if we get a move on we’ll be able to save them places.” “Right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, picking up Hedwig’s cage in one hand and the handle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk in the other.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at <PER>Harry</PER> with great interest and that several of them nudged them's neighbors and pointed <PER>Harry</PER> out.
In the very last carriage they met <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom, <PER>Harry</PER>’s fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, Trevor.
“Hi, <PER>Ginny</PER> Everywhere ’s full I can’t find a seat” “What are you talking about?” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, who had squeezed past <PER>Neville</PER> to peer into the compartment behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> followed.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew at once why <PER>Neville</PER> had chosen to pass this compartment by.
she eyes ranged over <PER>Neville</PER> and came to rest on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, smiling at <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> stowed the three trunks and Hedwig’s cage in the luggage rack and sat down.
<PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom — Luna Lovegood raised <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom — Luna Lovegood's upside-down magazine high enough to hide <PER>Neville</PER> Longbottom — Luna Lovegood's face and fell silent.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> looked at each other with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>'s eyebrows raised.
“Another Remembrall?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, remembering the marblelike device <PER>Neville</PER>’s grandmother had sent <PER>Neville</PER>’s in an effort to improve <PER>Neville</PER>’s's abysmal memory.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time, merely looked as though her was wearing a slimy green hat, but <PER>Harry</PER>, whose hands had been busy preventing the escape of Trevor, received a face full.
“Um bad time?” <PER>Harry</PER> wiped the lenses of <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses with <PER>Harry</PER>'s Trevor- free hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> slumped back in <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat and groaned.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have liked <PER>Cho</PER> to discover <PER>Harry</PER> sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke <PER>Harry</PER> had just told; <PER>Harry</PER> would not have chosen to be sitting with <PER>Neville</PER> and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone by.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> had finished <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>'s Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage.
“I’m starving,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog from <PER>Harry</PER> and throwing himself into the seat next to himself.
“Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking thoroughly disgruntled as <PER>Hermione</PER> took <PER>Hermione</PER>'s seat.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>,” replied <PER>Harry</PER> at once, <PER>Harry</PER>'s worst fear confirmed.
“How <PER>Hermione</PER> got to be a prefect when <PER>Hermione</PER>’s thicker than a concussed troll ” “Who’s Hufflepuff?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around at <PER>Ginny</PER> for some kind of explanation, but <PER>Ginny</PER> had stuffed <PER>Ginny</PER>'s knuckles in <PER>Ginny</PER>'s mouth to stop <PER>Ginny</PER> giggling.
“We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,” he told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>, “and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving.
“Yeah, right, because <PER>Malfoy</PER> won’t abuse it at all,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sarcastically.
“So you’re going to descend to his level?” “No, I’m just going to make sure I get his mates before his gets mine.” “For heaven’s sake, <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, him hates writing,” said <PER>Ron</PER> happily.
Upside down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was, but <PER>Harry</PER> now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge; <PER>Harry</PER> only recognized <PER>Harry</PER> because of the lime-green bowler hat.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened the magazine and scanned the index; until this moment <PER>Harry</PER> had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed Arthur to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The Quibbler.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to read this sentence several times before <PER>Harry</PER> was convinced that <PER>Harry</PER> had not misunderstood it.
“<PER>Cornelius</PER> ‘Goblin-Crusher’ Fudge, that’s what his friends call his, if you could hear his when his thinks no one’s listening, oh, his’s always talking about the goblins his’s had done in; his’s had them drowned, his’s ’s had them dropped off buildings, his’s had them poisoned, his’s had them cooked in pies” <PER>Harry</PER> did not read any further.
Fudge might have many faults but <PER>Harry</PER> found it extremely hard to imagine <PER>Harry</PER> ordering goblins to be cooked in pies.
“Anything good in there?” asked <PER>Ron</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> closed the magazine.
“Of course not,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> scathingly, before <PER>Harry</PER> could answer, “ The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that.” “Excuse me,” said Luna; Luna's voice had suddenly lost's voice dreamy quality.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around; <PER>Harry</PER> had expected this, but that did not make the sight of <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> smirking at <PER>Harry</PER> from between <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s cronies Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable.
“You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.” <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> laughed.
“Shut up, <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply.
Sniggering, <PER>Malfoy</PER> gave <PER>Harry</PER> a last malicious look and departed, Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his wake.
<PER>Hermione</PER> slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew at once that <PER>Hermione</PER>, like him, had registered what <PER>Malfoy</PER> had said and been just as unnerved by it.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not talk freely in front of <PER>Neville</PER> and Luna.
<PER>Harry</PER> exchanged another nervous look with <PER>Hermione</PER> and then stared out of the window.
<PER>Harry</PER> had thought Sirius coming with <PER>Harry</PER> to the station was a bit of a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dangerous <PER>Hermione</PER> had been right Sirius should not have come.
What if Mister <PER>Malfoy</PER> had noticed the black dog and told <PER>Draco</PER>, what if he had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks, and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding?
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting with <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead pressed against the train window, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> pinned their prefect badges carefully to their prefect badges's prefect badges's prefect badges's chests.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> checking how it looked in the black window.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were supposed to supervise all this; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> disappeared from the carriage again, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.
“I’ll carry that owl, if you like,” said Luna to <PER>Harry</PER>, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as <PER>Neville</PER> stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket.
“I don’t know,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, “but we’d better get out of the way, we’re blocking the door.” “Oh yeah ” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the station.
Jostled by the crowd, <PER>Harry</PER> squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of <PER>Hagrid</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> had to be here, <PER>Harry</PER> had been relying on it — seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> again had been one of the things to which <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking forward most.
<PER>Harry</PER> can’t have left, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s just got a cold or something <PER>Harry</PER> looked around for <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER>, wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of they was anywhere near him, so him allowed him to be shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade station.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced quickly at the students, turned away to keep a lookout for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, then did a double take.
“Where’s Pig?” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice, right behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“That Luna girl was carrying him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, turning quickly, eager to consult <PER>Ron</PER> about <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“He’d better be okay” A short distance away, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, followed by a small gang of cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timid-looking second years out of the way so that they could get a coach to they.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> was being absolutely foul to a first year back there, I swear I’m going to report “<PER>Malfoy</PER>, “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s only had “<PER>Malfoy</PER>'s badge three minutes and “<PER>Malfoy</PER>’s using it to bully people worse than ever Where’s Crookshanks?” “<PER>Ginny</PER>’s got him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Thanks,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, relieving <PER>Ginny</PER> of the cat.
“Come on, let’s get a carriage together before they all fillup” “I haven’t got Pig yet!” <PER>Ron</PER> said, but <PER>Hermione</PER> was already heading off toward the nearest unoccupied coach.
<PER>Harry</PER> remained behind with <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Well, come on then, let’s get in what were you saying, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “I was saying, what are those horse things?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, as he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Luna made for the carriage in which <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> were already sitting.
<PER>Ron</PER>, however, gave <PER>Harry</PER> a perplexed look.
“What are you talking about?” “I’m talking about — look!” <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm and wheeled him about so that him was face-to-face with the winged horse.
<PER>Ron</PER> stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Are you feeling all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “I yeah ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt utterly bewildered.
Yet unless <PER>Ron</PER> was faking — and it was a very feeble joke if he was — <PER>Ron</PER> could not see it at all.
“Shall we get in, then?” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly, looking at <PER>Harry</PER> as though worried about <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yeah, go on ” “It’s all right,” said a dreamy voice from beside <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Ron</PER> vanished into the coach’s dark interior.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to tell the others that <PER>Harry</PER> and Luna were having the same hallucination, if that was what it was, so <PER>Harry</PER> said nothing about the horses as <PER>Harry</PER> sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“He isn’t a very good teacher, is He?” “Yes, He is!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> glared at <PER>Hermione</PER>; she cleared shis throat and quickly said, “Erm yes he’s very good.” “Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said Luna, unfazed.
When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds, <PER>Harry</PER> leaned forward to try and see whether there were any lights on in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete darkness.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned again to look for lit windows down by the forest, but there was definitely no sign of life within <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
Unwillingly, because <PER>Harry</PER> had half hoped they would have vanished, <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes instead upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air, their blank white eyes gleaming.
<PER>Harry</PER> had once before had the experience of seeing something that <PER>Ron</PER> could not, but that had been a reflection in a mirror, something much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages.
If Luna was to be believed, the beasts had always been there but invisible; why, then, could <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly see the beasts, and why could <PER>Ron</PER> not?
Again <PER>Harry</PER> noticed people putting people's heads together to whisper as <PER>Harry</PER> passed; <PER>Harry</PER> gritted <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth and tried to act as though <PER>Harry</PER> neither noticed nor cared.
The moment they reached Gryffindor’s, <PER>Ginny</PER> was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left to sit with them; <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave <PER>Harry</PER> airy, overly friendly greetings that made <PER>Harry</PER> quite sure they had stopped talking about <PER>Harry</PER> a split second before.
<PER>Harry</PER> had more important things to worry about, however: <PER>Harry</PER> was looking over the students’ heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s not there.” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> scanned the staff table too, though there was no real need; <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s size made <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s instantly obvious in any lineup.
“But where is <PER>Harry</PER>, then?” There was a pause, then <PER>Harry</PER> said very quietly, so that <PER>Neville</PER>, Parvati, and Lavender could not hear, “Maybe <PER>Harry</PER>’s not back yet.
“It’s that <PER>Umbridge</PER> woman!” “Who?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> was at my hearing, <PER>Hermione</PER> works for Fudge!” “Nice cardigan,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, smirking.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> works for Fudge?” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated, frowning.
“What on earth’s she doing here, then?” “Dunno ” <PER>Hermione</PER> scanned the staff table, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes narrowed.
“No,” she muttered, “no, surely not ” <PER>Harry</PER> did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask; <PER>Harry</PER>'s attention had just been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked shis way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> recalled, fleetingly, how terrified <PER>Harry</PER> had felt when <PER>Harry</PER> had stood there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which House <PER>Harry</PER> belonged.
“Yes, indeed,” said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning across <PER>Neville</PER> toward Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably's (<PER>Neville</PER> winced, it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you).
With a last frowning look that swept the four House tables, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> lowered Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyes to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s long piece of parchment and called out, “Abercrombie, Euan.” The terrified-looking boy <PER>Harry</PER> had noticed earlier stumbled forward and put the hat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s head; it was only prevented from falling right down to The terrified-looking boy <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders by The terrified-looking boy <PER>Harry</PER>'s very prominent ears.
Slowly the long line of first years thinned; in the pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat’s decisions, <PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Ron</PER>’s stomach rumbling loudly.
Finally, “Zeller, Rose” was sorted into Hufflepuff, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> picked up the hat and stool and marched them away as Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> rose to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Harry</PER> was somehow soothed to see Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> standing before them all, whatever Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s recent bitter feelings toward <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s headmaster.
Between the absence of <PER>Hagrid</PER> and the presence of those dragonish horses, <PER>Harry</PER> had felt that <PER>Harry</PER>'s return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song.
His mouth was so full <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was quite an achievement for <PER>Harry</PER> to make any noise at all.
“Of course, it lives in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office, so I daresay it picks things up there.” “And it wants all the Houses to be friends?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking over at the Slytherin table, where <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was holding court.
“Well done, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile their; <PER>Harry</PER> felt it was a better use of <PER>Harry</PER>'s time to eat <PER>Harry</PER>'s way steadily through <PER>Harry</PER>'s steak-and- kidney pie, then a large plateful of <PER>Harry</PER>'s favorite treacle tart.
When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the hall was starting to creep upward again, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> got to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feet once more.
<PER>Harry</PER> four-poster bed was waiting somewhere above, wonderfully warm and soft “Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“First years ought to know that the forest in the grounds is out of bounds to students — and a few of our older students ought to know by now too.” (<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged smirks.)
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> continued, “Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams will take place on the — ” He broke off, looking inquiringly at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
As she was not much taller standing than sitting, there was a moment when nobody understood why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had stopped talking, but then Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> said, “Hem, hem,” and it became clear that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had got to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s feet and was intending to make a speech.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> only looked taken aback for a moment, then <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat back down smartly and looked alertly at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> desired nothing better than to listen to shis talk.
Professor Sprout’s eyebrows had disappeared into Professor Sprout's flyaway hair, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s mouth was as thin as <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen it.
“Thank you, Headmaster,” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> simpered, “for those kind words of welcome.” Her voice was high-pitched, breathy, and little-girlish and again, <PER>Harry</PER> felt a powerful rush of dislike that <PER>Harry</PER> could not explain to <PER>Harry</PER>; all <PER>Harry</PER> knew was that <PER>Harry</PER> loathed everything about her, from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike, and <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly saw shis exchange a significant glance with Professor Sprout as <PER>Umbridge</PER> gave another little “Hem, hem” and went on with shis speech.
Over at the Ravenclaw table, <PER>Cho</PER> Chang was chatting animatedly with <PER>Cho</PER> Chang's friends.
Meanwhile at the Hufflepuff table, Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still staring at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, but Ernie Macmillan was glassy-eyed and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure Ernie Macmillan was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefect’s badge gleaming on Ernie Macmillan's chest.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> did not seem to notice the restlessness of Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s audience.
The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be drinking in every word <PER>Umbridge</PER> spoke, though judging by <PER>Hermione</PER>'s expression, they were not at all to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s taste. "
The staff followed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s lead, though <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that several of them brought them's hands together only once or twice before stopping.
“Thank you very much, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, that was most illuminating,” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> said, bowing to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“You’re not telling me you enjoyed it?” <PER>Ron</PER> said quietly, turning a glazed face upon <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, we’re supposed to show the first years where to go!” “Oh yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had obviously forgotten.
them did indeed seem very small; <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> had not appeared that young when <PER>Harry</PER> had arrived here.
“See you later,” he said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and he made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more whispering, staring, and pointing as he passed.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I know it!” someone panted from behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> turned to see <PER>Neville</PER> jogging toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Mimbulus mimbletonio 1” “Correct,” said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung open toward them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through which <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> now climbed.
<PER>Harry</PER> waved good night to Fred and George Weasley and headed straight for the door to the boys’ dormitories; <PER>Harry</PER> was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment.
They had been talking as <PER>Harry</PER> pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment They saw <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether they had been talking about <PER>Harry</PER>, then whether <PER>Harry</PER> was being paranoid.
“Hi,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, moving across to <PER>Harry</PER>'s own trunk and opening it.
“Good holiday?” “Not bad,” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, as a true account of <PER>Harry</PER>'s holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and <PER>Harry</PER> could not face it.
Then he said, with his back still turned to <PER>Harry</PER>, “Me mam didn’t want me to come back.” “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pausing in the act of pulling off <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt vaguely as though something was closing in on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes, “she er well, it’s not just you, it’s <PER>Dumbledore</PER> too ” “She believes the Daily Prophet?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand down onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table, pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes, stuffed them angrily into <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk, and pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas.
Dean, who had been bending over his trunk, trying to retrieve a slipper, went oddly still and <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was listening hard.
“Don’t talk to me like that!” “I’ll talk to you how I want,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s temper rising so fast <PER>Harry</PER> snatched <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back from <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table.
“If you’ve got a problem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask <PER>McGonagall</PER> if you can be moved, stop your mummy worrying — ” “Leave my mother out of this, Potter!” “What’s going on?” <PER>Ron</PER> had appeared in the doorway.
“<PER>Harry</PER> wouldn’t do that — we met your mother, we liked your mother” “That’s before she started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me!” said <PER>Harry</PER> at the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice.
“You believe all the rubbish he’s come out with about <PER>Voldemort</PER>, do you, you reckon he’s telling the truth?” “Yeah, I do!” said <PER>Ron</PER> angrily.
<PER>Ron</PER> glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> said aggressively.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillows while <PER>Ron</PER> bustled around the next bed, putting <PER>Harry</PER>'s things away.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt shaken by the argument with Seamus, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had always liked very much.
Had <PER>Dumbledore</PER> suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown <PER>Dumbledore</PER> from the International Confederation of Wizards's ranks?
Was it anger at <PER>Harry</PER>, perhaps, that had stopped <PER>Dumbledore</PER> getting in touch with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for months?
The two of them were in this together, after all; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had believed <PER>Harry</PER>, announced <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s version of events to the whole school and then to the wider Wizarding community.
Anyone who thought <PER>Harry</PER> was a liar had to think that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was too or else that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been hoodwinked They’ll know we’re right in the end, thought <PER>Harry</PER> miserably, as <PER>Ron</PER> got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory.
But <PER>Harry</PER> wondered how many attacks like Seamus’s <PER>Harry</PER> would have to endure before that time came.
Seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before <PER>Harry</PER> had even put on <PER>Harry</PER>'s socks.
“Does <PER>Harry</PER> think hell turn into a nutter if <PER>Harry</PER> stays in a room with me too long?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, as the hem of Seamus’s robes whipped out of sight.
<PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both gave <PER>Harry</PER> it’s-his-problem-not- yours looks, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not much consoled.
“What’s the matter?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> five minutes later, catching up with <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> halfway across the common room as they all headed toward breakfast.
“We’ll have to talk to them, <PER>Ron</PER>.” <PER>Ron</PER> looked positively alarmed.
“It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!” <PER>Ron</PER> said nothing; <PER>Harry</PER> could tell from <PER>Harry</PER>'s glum expression that the prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they liked was not one that <PER>Harry</PER> found inviting.
“Anyway, what’s up, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> continued, as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards, all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in them's own conversation.
“You look really angry about something.” “Seamus reckons <PER>Harry</PER>’s lying about You-Know- Who,” said <PER>Ron</PER> succinctly, when <PER>Harry</PER> did not respond.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had expected to react angrily on his behalf, sighed.
“No,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> calmly, “I told <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to keep <PER>Hermione</PER>'s big fat mouth shut about you, actually.
“Don’t you remember what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said at the end-of-term feast last year?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both looked at her blankly, and <PER>Hermione</PER> sighed again.
“I listen, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a touch of asperity.
“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what — ” “The point,” <PER>Hermione</PER> pressed on loudly, “is that this sort of thing is exactly what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was talking about.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> didn’t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman’s staying,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor table.
“What?” said both <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
“Well maybe he didn’t want to draw attention to <PER>Hagrid</PER> not being here.” “What d’you mean, draw attention to it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, half laughing.
“How could we not notice?” Before <PER>Hermione</PER> could answer, a tall black girl with long, braided hair had marched up to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Hi, Angelina.” “Hi,” Angelina said briskly, “good summer?” And without waiting for an answer, “Listen, I’ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.” “Nice one,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning at her; <PER>Harry</PER> suspected Angelina’s pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood’s had been, which could only be an improvement.
“I’d forgotten Wood had left,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely, sitting down beside <PER>Ron</PER> and pulling a plate of toast toward <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> was a good Keeper” “Still, it won’t hurt to have some new blood, will it?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Hedwig was nowhere to be seen, but <PER>Harry</PER> was hardly surprised; <PER>Harry</PER>'s only correspondent was Sirius, and <PER>Harry</PER> doubted Sirius would have anything new to tell <PER>Harry</PER> after only twenty-four hours apart.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, however, had to move <PER>Hermione</PER>] orange juice aside quickly to make way for a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak.
“What are you still getting that for?” said <PER>Harry</PER> irritably, thinking of Seamus, as <PER>Hermione</PER> placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl’s leg and it took off again.
“I’m not bothering load of rubbish.” “It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> darkly, and <PER>Hermione</PER> unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind the newspaper, not emerging until <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had finished eating.
“Nothing about you or <PER>Dumbledore</PER> or anything.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was now moving along the table handing out schedules.
“History of Magic, double Potions, Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts Binns, <PER>Snape</PER>, Trelawney, and that <PER>Umbridge</PER> woman all in one day!
“Cheers,” said <PER>Ron</PER> moodily, pocketing his schedule, “but I think I’ll take the lessons.” “And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, eyeing Fred and George beadily, “you can’t advertise for testers on the Gryffindor notice board.” “Says who?” said George, looking astonished.
“And <PER>Ron</PER>.” “Leave me out of it,” said <PER>Ron</PER> hastily.
<PER>Harry</PER> face felt hot; <PER>Harry</PER> deliberately dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s fork and dived down to retrieve ] fork.
“What did that mean?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying <PER>Hermione</PER>’s notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns ’s voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain disengaged, and <PER>Harry</PER> spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parchment with <PER>Ron</PER>, while <PER>Hermione</PER> shot them filthy looks out of the corner of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eye.
“How would it be,” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked them coldly as them left the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), “if I refused to lend you my notes this year?” “We’d fail our O.W.L.s,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“We just haven’t got your brains or your memory or your concentration — you’re just cleverer than We are — is it nice to rub it in?” “Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, but <PER>Hermione</PER> looked slightly mollified as <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way out into the damp courtyard.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what <PER>Snape</PER> was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner toward them.
“Hello, <PER>Harry</PER>!” It was <PER>Cho</PER> Chang and what was more, <PER>Cho</PER> Chang was on <PER>Cho</PER> Chang's own again.
This was most unusual: <PER>Cho</PER> was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; <PER>Harry</PER> remembered the agony of trying to get <PER>Cho</PER>'s by <PER>Cho</PER> to ask <PER>Cho</PER>'s to the Yule Ball.
“Hi,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, feeling <PER>Harry</PER>'s face grow hot.
“So did you er have a good summer?” The moment he had said this he wished he hadn’t: Cedric had been <PER>Cho</PER>’s boyfriend and the memory of Cedric's death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected <PER>Harry</PER>’s Something seemed to tauten in her face, but her said, “Oh, it was all right, you know” “Is that a Tornados badge?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded suddenly, pointing at the front of <PER>Cho</PER>’s robes, to which a sky- blue badge emblazoned with a double gold T was pinned.
“Have you always supported them, or just since them started winning the league?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, in what <PER>Harry</PER> considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice.
“Anyway see you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Cho</PER> walked away.
<PER>Hermione</PER> waited until <PER>Cho</PER> was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on <PER>Ron</PER>.
They did not stop arguing all the way down to <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, which gave <PER>Harry</PER> plenty of time to reflect that between <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> he would be lucky ever to have two minutes’ conversation with <PER>Cho</PER> that <PER>Cho</PER> could look back on without wanting to leave the country.
And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside <PER>Snape</PER>’s classroom door, <PER>Snape</PER> had chosen to come and talk to <PER>Snape</PER>, hadn’t <PER>Snape</PER>?
She had been Cedric’s girlfriend; She could easily have hated <PER>Harry</PER> for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet She was talking to <PER>Harry</PER> in a perfectly friendly way, not as though She thought <PER>Harry</PER> mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric’s death Yes, She had definitely chosen to come and talk to <PER>Harry</PER>, and that made the second time in two days and at this thought, <PER>Harry</PER>’s spirits rose.
Even the ominous sound of <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in <PER>Snape</PER>'s chest.
<PER>Snape</PER> filed into the classroom behind <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and followed them to them's usual table at the back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them.
“Settle down,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, shutting the door behind <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> glared back, feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to give up Potions after fifth year.
“The ingredients and method” — <PER>Snape</PER> flicked — <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand — “are on the blackboard” — (they appeared there) — “you will find everything you need” — he flicked his wand again — “in the store cupboard” — (the door of the said cupboard sprang open) — “you have an hour and a half Start.” Just as <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had predicted, — <PER>Snape</PER> could hardly have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion.
The surface of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s potion, however, was a shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as <PER>Snape</PER> swept by <PER>Snape</PER> looked down <PER>Snape</PER>'s hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that <PER>Snape</PER> could find nothing to criticize.
At <PER>Harry</PER>’s cauldron, however, <PER>Snape</PER> stopped, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER> with a horrible smirk on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Potter, what is this supposed to be?” The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they loved hearing <PER>Snape</PER> taunt <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Tell me, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> softly, “can you read?” <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> laughed.
“Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.” While everyone around him filled their flagons, <PER>Harry</PER> cleared away <PER>Harry</PER>'s things, seething.
<PER>Harry</PER> potion had been no worse than <PER>Ron</PER>’s, which was now giving off a foul odor of bad eggs, or <PER>Neville</PER>’s, which had achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which <PER>Neville</PER> was now having to gouge out of his cauldron, yet it was he, <PER>Harry</PER>, who would be receiving zero marks for the day’s work.
When at long last the bell rang, <PER>Harry</PER> was first out of the dungeon and had already started <PER>Harry</PER>'s lunch by the time <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> joined <PER>Harry</PER> in the Great Hall.
“That was really unfair,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> consolingly, sitting down next to <PER>Harry</PER> and helping <PER>Hermione</PER> to shepherd’s pie.
“Your potion wasn’t nearly as bad as Goyle’s, when Your potion put Your potion in Your potion's flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire.” “Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glowering at <PER>Harry</PER>'s plate, “since when has <PER>Snape</PER> ever been fair to me?” Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>’s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had set foot in Hogwarts.
“Anyway, I’ve always thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was cracked trusting <PER>Snape</PER>, where’s the evidence <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ever really stopped working for <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” “I think <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s probably got plenty of evidence, even if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t share it with you, <PER>Ron</PER>,” snapped <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said <PER>Harry</PER> heavily, as <PER>Ron</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to argue back.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both froze, looking angry and offended.
The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside He, and the vision of <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shocked faces afforded He a sense of deep satisfaction.
“Come back, you scurvy dog, stand fast and fight!” yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from behind Sir Cadogan's visor, but <PER>Harry</PER> merely walked on, and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow Sir Cadogan by running into a neighboring picture, <PER>Harry</PER> was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and angry-looking wolfhound.
<PER>Harry</PER> spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of North Tower, and consequently <PER>Harry</PER> was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sibyll Trelawney’s classroom when the bell rang.
she was busy putting copies of battered, leather-bound books on each of the spindly little tables with which shis room was littered when <PER>Harry</PER> entered the room, but so dim was the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the low-burning, sickly-scented fire that she appeared not to notice <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> took a seat in the shadows.
<PER>Ron</PER> emerged from the trapdoor, looked around carefully, spotted <PER>Harry</PER> and made directly for <PER>Harry</PER>, or as directly as <PER>Harry</PER> could while having to wend <PER>Harry</PER>'s way between tables, chairs, and overstuffed poufs.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> and me have stopped arguing,” he said, sitting down beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Hermione</PER> says <PER>Hermione</PER> thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
At the table next to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, Dean had paired up with <PER>Neville</PER>, who immediately embarked on a long- winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother’s best hat; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> merely looked at each other glumly.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not going to share <PER>Harry</PER>'s dreams with anyone.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well what <PER>Harry</PER>'s regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, <PER>Harry</PER> did not need <PER>Ron</PER> or Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him that “Well, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the other night,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, screwing up his face in an effort to remember.
When the bell went, he and <PER>Ron</PER> led the way back down the ladder, <PER>Ron</PER> grumbling loudly.
<PER>Harry</PER> shoved <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and pulled out quill, ink, and parchment.
“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t your teaching in this subject?” stated Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, turning to face the class with Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s hands clasped neatly in front of Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
When everyone had copied down Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s three course aims Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> said, “Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?” There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.
“When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply ‘Yes, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>,’ or ‘No, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.’ So, has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?” “Yes, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>,” rang through the room.
“I should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be no need to talk.” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> left the blackboard and settled ” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> in the chair behind the teacher’s desk, observing them all with those pouchy toad’s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned to page five of <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked right and received a surprise to shake <PER>Harry</PER> out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s torpor.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had not even opened <PER>Hermione</PER>'s copy of Defensive Magical Theory.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was staring fixedly at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand in the air.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not remember <PER>Hermione</PER> ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s questioningly, but <PER>Hermione</PER> merely shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head slightly to indicate that <PER>Hermione</PER> was not about to answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction.
After several more minutes had passed, however, <PER>Harry</PER> was not the only one watching <PER>Hermione</PER>.
The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch <PER>Hermione</PER>’s mute attempt to catch Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s eye than to struggle on with “Basics for Beginners.” When more than half the class were staring at <PER>Hermione</PER> rather than at their books, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> seemed to decide that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> could ignore the situation no longer.
“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” she asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had only just noticed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“And your name is — ?” “<PER>Hermione</PER> Granger,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> immediately raised their hands too.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s pouchy eyes lingered on <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment before she addressed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?” “Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?” asked Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> in Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s falsely sweet voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> thrust <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist in the air.
“If we’re going to be attacked, it won’t be risk-free — ” “I repeat,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, “do you expect to be attacked during my classes?” “No, but — ” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> talked over him.
“Are you telling us that the first time us’ll get to do the spells will be during our exam?” “I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough — ” “And what good’s theory going to be in the real world?” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist in the air again.
“Hmm, let’s think ” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a mock thoughtful voice, “maybe Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; <PER>Neville</PER> slipped sideways off <PER>Neville</PER>'s stool.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was staring at <PER>Harry</PER> with a grimly satisfied expression on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s face.
Everyone was staring at either <PER>Umbridge</PER> or <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> stood up and leaned toward them, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s stubby-fingered hands splayed on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s desk.
“You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead — ” “He wasn’t dead,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, “but yeah, He’s returned!” “Mister-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten- points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> in one breath without looking at him.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, no!” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his sleeve, but <PER>Harry</PER> jerked his arm out of her reach.
“So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of Cedric Diggory's own accord, did Cedric Diggory?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice shaking.
There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, had ever heard <PER>Harry</PER> talk about what had happened on the night that Cedric had died.
They stared avidly from <PER>Harry</PER> to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> killed him, and you know it.” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s face was quite blank.
Then she said, in shis softest, most sweetly girlish voice, “Come here, Potter, dear.” he kicked his chair aside, strode around <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and up to the teacher’s desk.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s quill into a bottle of ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that <PER>Harry</PER> could not see what Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was writing.
“Take this to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, dear,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, holding out the note to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
He took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not even looking back at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and slamming the classroom door shut behind <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Get out of it, Peeves.” “Oooh, Crackpot’s feeling cranky,” said Peeves, pursuing <PER>Harry</PER> along the corridor, leering as <PER>Harry</PER> zoomed along above <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Is this true?” “Is what true?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, rather more aggressively than <PER>Harry</PER> had intended.
“Is it true that you shouted at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You called her a liar?” “Yes.” “You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?” “Yes.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> sat down behind her desk, frowning at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And sit down.” There had been a previous occasion when <PER>Harry</PER>, expecting to be caned by Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, had instead been appointed by her to the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> set down Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s note and looked very seriously at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Potter, you need to be careful.” <PER>Harry</PER> swallowed <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at Ginger Newt.
“Misbehavior in Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s class could cost you much more than House points and a detention.” “What do you — ?” “Potter, use your common sense,” snapped Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, with an abrupt return to Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s usual manner.
“It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said, looking down at <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s note again.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back, you know he is, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knows he is — ” “For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, straightening her glasses angrily (her had winced horribly when he had used <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name).
“Didn’t you listen to Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I’m glad you listen to <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger at any rate,” <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger said, pointing <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger out of <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger's office.
The news about <PER>Harry</PER>'s shouting match with <PER>Umbridge</PER> seemed to have traveled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts standards.
He heard whispers all around him as him sat eating between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“he says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered” “he reckons he dueled with <PER>Voldemort</PER>” “Come off it” “Who does he think he’s kidding?” “Pur - lease ” “What I don’t get,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a shaking voice, laying down <PER>Harry</PER>'s knife and fork (<PER>Harry</PER> hands were trembling too much to hold them steady), “is why they all believed the story two months ago when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told them” “The thing is, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’m not sure they did,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly.
“Oh, let’s get out of here.” <PER>Hermione</PER> slammed down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own knife and fork; <PER>Ron</PER> looked sadly at his half-finished apple pie but followed suit.
“What d’you mean, you’re not sure they believed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> when they reached the first-floor landing.
“You arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedric’s dead body None of us saw what happened in the maze We just had <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s word for it that You-Know- Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought you.” “Which is the truth!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly.
“I know it is, <PER>Harry</PER>, so will you please stop biting my head off?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> wearily.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s first day had lasted a week, but <PER>Harry</PER> still had a mountain of homework to do before bed.
Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took them's three favorite chairs at the fireside himself leapt lightly into <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion.
“How can <PER>Dumbledore</PER> have let this happen?” <PER>Hermione</PER> cried suddenly, making <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted.
“Don’t start arguing again,” said <PER>Harry</PER> wearily, as <PER>Ron</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to retaliate.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s face averted from the portrait hole, but could still sense the stares <PER>Harry</PER> was attracting.
“Shall we do <PER>Snape</PER>’s stuff first?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, dipping his quill into his ink.
“So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making?” But <PER>Hermione</PER> was not listening; <PER>Hermione</PER> was squinting over into the far corner of the room, where Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the center of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding.
“Come on, <PER>Ron</PER>.” “I — what?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, plainly playing for time.
“No — come on, <PER>Hermione</PER> — we can’t tell them off for giving out sweets” “You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or — or Puking Pastilles or — ” “Fainting Fancies?” <PER>Harry</PER> suggested quietly.
Most of the people watching were laughing; <PER>Hermione</PER>, however, squared <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first years.
<PER>Ron</PER> rose halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to <PER>Harry</PER>, “She’s got it under control,” before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted.
<PER>Hermione</PER> drew <PER>Hermione</PER> up to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s full height; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes were narrowed and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity.
With a last threatening look at them, <PER>Hermione</PER> thrust Fred’s clipboard and the bag of Fancies back into his arms and stalked back to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s chair by the fire.
“Thank you for your support, <PER>Ron</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said acidly.
“And you’re covering them up with rubbish first?” “Yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> defiantly, swinging <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag onto <PER>Hermione</PER>'s back.
“There’s no point trying to finish this now, I can’t do it without <PER>Hermione</PER>, I haven’t got a clue what you’re supposed to do with moonstones, have you?” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, noticing as <PER>Harry</PER> did so that the ache in <PER>Harry</PER>'s right temple was getting worse.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation.
“But on the plus side, no <PER>Snape</PER> today,” said <PER>Ron</PER> bracingly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> yawned widely and poured <PER>Hermione</PER> some coffee.
<PER>Hermione</PER> looked mildly pleased about something, and when <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s what <PER>Hermione</PER> had to be so happy about, <PER>Hermione</PER> simply said, “The hats have gone.
Professor Flitwick and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> both spent the first fifteen minutes of Professor Flitwick and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> both's lessons lecturing the class on the importance of O.W.L.s.
By the end of a double period, neither he nor <PER>Ron</PER> had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practicing, though <PER>Ron</PER> said hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, on the other hand, successfully vanished <PER>Hermione</PER>'s snail on the third attempt, earning <PER>Hermione</PER>'s a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion-making.
Still angry about <PER>Ron</PER>’s slur on her woolly hats, <PER>Hermione</PER> did not join woolly hats.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them; turning, them saw <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> striding toward them, surrounded by <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s usual gang of Slytherin cronies.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table.
“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating <PER>Harry</PER>: Anyone would have thought that <PER>Hagrid</PER> never showed them impressive creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so.
<PER>Harry</PER> deliberately circled around the back so that <PER>Harry</PER> ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-Plank.
“Where’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” ’s <PER>Hagrid</PER>?
Smirking all over his pointed face, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> leaned across <PER>Harry</PER> and seized the largest bowtruckle.
“Maybe,” said <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> in an undertone, so that only <PER>Harry</PER> could hear him, “the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.” “Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” said <PER>Harry</PER> out of the side of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
“Maybe himself’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for himself, if you get my drift.” <PER>Malfoy</PER> walked away, smirking over his shoulder at <PER>Harry</PER>, who suddenly felt sick.
His hurried back around the table to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough to draw it.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled out parchment and quill, crouched down beside the others, and related in a whisper what <PER>Malfoy</PER> had just said.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> would know if something had happened to <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
<PER>Harry</PER> dropped it; Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of <PER>Hagrid</PER> being sacked, laughed still harder as the bowtruckle set off at full tilt toward the forest, a little, moving stickman soon swallowed up by the tree roots.
When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds <PER>Harry</PER> rolled up <PER>Harry</PER>'s bloodstained bowtruckle picture and marched off to Herbology with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand wrapped in a handkerchief of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s and <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s derisive laughter still ringing in his ears.
“If his calls <PER>Hagrid</PER> a moron one more time ” snarled <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, don’t go picking a row with <PER>Malfoy</PER>, don’t forget, <PER>Harry</PER>’s a prefect now, <PER>Harry</PER> could make life difficult for you” “Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult life?” said <PER>Harry</PER> sarcastically.
<PER>Ron</PER> laughed, but <PER>Hermione</PER> frowned.
“I just wish <PER>Hagrid</PER> would hurry up and get back, that’s all,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses.
“Because <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll never be as good as <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, fully aware that <PER>Harry</PER> had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.
When she saw <PER>Harry</PER>, shis prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for <PER>Harry</PER>.
“D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> as they made their way into class.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, <PER>Harry</PER>, you can do better than her,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ginny</PER>’s told me all about <PER>Ginny</PER>, apparently her’ll only believe in things as long as there’s no proof at all.
Ernie’s words had certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Brown’s face and, as he turned to talk to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> caught Seamus’s expression, which looked both confused and defiant.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished all the teachers would stop doing this; <PER>Harry</PER> was starting to get an anxious, twisted feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach every time <PER>Harry</PER> remembered how much homework <PER>Harry</PER> had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class.
As <PER>Harry</PER> was starving, and <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s first detention with <PER>Umbridge</PER> at five o’clock, <PER>Harry</PER> headed straight for dinner without dropping off <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag in Gryffindor Tower so that <PER>Harry</PER> could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had barely reached the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice said, “Oy, Potter!” “What now?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she was in a towering temper.
“I’ll tell you what now,” she said, marching straight up to <PER>Harry</PER> and poking <PER>Harry</PER> hard in the chest with shis finger.
“I got detention from that <PER>Umbridge</PER> woman, just because I told her the truth about <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on Friday,” said Angelina fiercely, “and I don’t care how you do it, tell her <PER>Voldemort</PER> ’s a figment of your imagination if you like, just make sure you’re therel” her stormed away.
“You know what?” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> as they entered the Great Hall.
“I think we’d better check with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Wood’s been killed during a training session, because she seems to be channeling his spirit.” “What d’you reckon are the odds of <PER>Umbridge</PER> letting you off on Friday?” said <PER>Ron</PER> skeptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.
“And it looks like it’s going to rain.” “What’s that got to do with our homework?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyebrows raised.
At five to five <PER>Harry</PER> bade the other two good-bye and set off for <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office on the third floor.
These were so foul that <PER>Harry</PER> stared at them, transfixed, until Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> spoke again.
With a massive effort <PER>Harry</PER> looked away from She, dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s schoolbag beside the straight-backed chair, and sat down.
At the same time, The words had appeared on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s right hand, cut into <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin as though traced there by a scalpel — yet even as <PER>Harry</PER> stared at the shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin, once again they healed over seconds later.
Again and again <PER>Harry</PER> wrote the words on the parchment in what <PER>Harry</PER> soon came to realize was not ink, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s own blood.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not ask when <PER>Harry</PER> would be allowed to stop.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not even check <PER>Harry</PER>'s watch.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew she was watching <PER>Harry</PER> for signs of weakness and <PER>Harry</PER> was not going to show any, not even if <PER>Harry</PER> had to sit here all night, cutting open <PER>Harry</PER>'s own hand with this quill “Come here,” she said, after what seemed hours.
When <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at it <PER>Harry</PER> saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was red raw.
<PER>Harry</PER> repressed a shudder as she touched <PER>Harry</PER> with shis thick, stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings.
He skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled <PER>Ron</PER> keeping a disheveled <PER>Ron</PER> company.
“How come you didn’t do it last night?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, as <PER>Ron</PER> stared wildly around the common room for inspiration.
<PER>Ron</PER>, who had been fast asleep when <PER>Harry</PER> got back to the dormitory, muttered something about “doing other stuff,” bent low over <PER>Harry</PER>'s parchment, and scrawled a few words.
It was another bad day for <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to give up <PER>Harry</PER>'s lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and meanwhile, Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which <PER>Harry</PER> had no prospect of finishing that evening because of <PER>Harry</PER>'s second detention with <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“D’you think I’d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?” “At least it’s only lines,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> consolingly, as <PER>Harry</PER> sank back onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bench and looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s steak-and-kidney pie, which <PER>Harry</PER> no longer fancied very much.
“It’s not as if it’s a dreadful punishment, really” <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth, closed ] mouth again, and nodded.
He was not really sure why He was not telling <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exactly what was happening in <PER>Umbridge</PER> ’s room: He only knew that He did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct impression that <PER>Harry</PER> was not alone in concealing things at the moment.
The skin on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand became irritated more quickly now, red and inflamed; <PER>Harry</PER> thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for long.
Soon the cut would remain etched in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and <PER>Umbridge</PER> would, perhaps, be satisfied.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed very sleepy too, though <PER>Harry</PER> could not see why <PER>Harry</PER> should be.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s third detention passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two hours the words “I must not tell lies” did not fade from the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood.
She’s evil, He thought, as He climbed a staircase to the seventh floor, She’s an evil, twisted, mad, old — “<PER>Ron</PER>?” He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, and almost walked into <PER>Ron</PER>, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his broomstick.
He gave a great leap of surprise when He saw <PER>Harry</PER> and attempted to hide He's new Cleansweep Eleven behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
“Yeah, so do — <PER>Harry</PER>, what’s that on the back of your hand?” <PER>Harry</PER>, who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand, tried to hide it, but had as much success as <PER>Ron</PER> with his Cleans weep.
“It’s just a cut — it’s nothing — it’s — ” But <PER>Ron</PER> had grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s forearm and pulled the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand up level with <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
“I thought you said she was giving you lines?” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, but after all, <PER>Ron</PER> had been honest with <PER>Harry</PER>, so <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> the truth about the hours <PER>Harry</PER> had been spending in <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, then, tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> flatly.
“Why not?” “<PER>Harry</PER>’s got enough on <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but that was not the true reason.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not going to go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for help when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had not spoken to <PER>Harry</PER> once since last June.
“Well, I reckon you should — ” <PER>Ron</PER> began, but <PER>Harry</PER> was interrupted by the Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out, “Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?” Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week.
Though <PER>Harry</PER> glanced toward the staff table automatically when <PER>Harry</PER> entered the Great Hall, it was without real hope of seeing <PER>Hagrid</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind immediately to <PER>Harry</PER>'s more pressing problems, such as the mountainous pile of homework <PER>Harry</PER> had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention with <PER>Umbridge</PER> was sure to be, his had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of <PER>Ron</PER>’s tryout.
These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but <PER>Harry</PER> was grateful for anything that might lighten <PER>Harry</PER>'s present darkness; <PER>Harry</PER> had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts.
At five o’clock that evening <PER>Harry</PER> knocked on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office door for what <PER>Harry</PER> sincerely hoped would be the final time, was told to enter and did so.
“You know what to do, Potter,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, smiling sweetly over at <PER>Harry</PER>.
If <PER>Harry</PER> just shifted <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair an inch or so to the right On the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table himself managed it.
The sky was darkening so that <PER>Harry</PER> doubted <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to watch the sixth and seventh people at all.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was dozing in it, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s drink tipping precariously in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
“Well, <PER>Hermione</PER> said <PER>Hermione</PER> was pleased when I told <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking slightly put out.
“We can take off his name and put yours on instead” As <PER>Ron</PER> moved away, Angelina came striding up to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved over to sit next to <PER>Hermione</PER>, who awoke with a jerk as <PER>Harry</PER> put down <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag.
“Oh, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s you Good about <PER>Ron</PER>, isn’t it?” she said blearily.
“Great,” said <PER>Harry</PER> distractedly; if <PER>Harry</PER> did not tell somebody soon, <PER>Harry</PER> would burst.
“Listen, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I was just up in <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office and <PER>Hermione</PER> touched my arm ” <PER>Hermione</PER> listened closely.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished <PER>Hermione</PER> said slowly, “You’re worried that You-Know- Who’s controlling shis like he controlled <PER>Quirrell</PER>?” “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, dropping <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice, “it’s a possibility, isn’t it?” “I suppose so,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, though <PER>Hermione</PER> sounded unconvinced.
“But I don’t think he can be possessing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s the way he possessed <PER>Quirrell</PER>, I mean, he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own body, he wouldn’t need to share someone else’s.
Then <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> say it had to do with what You- Know- Who was feeling at the time?
“Twisted.” “She’s horrible, yes, but <PER>Harry</PER>, I think you ought to tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> your scar hurt.” It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and his answer to <PER>Hermione</PER> was just the same as his answer to <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was the first to awake in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory next morning.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the chink of sunlight falling through the gap in <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster’s hangings and savored the thought that it was Saturday.
Making straight for his favorite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, <PER>Harry</PER> settled <PER>Harry</PER> down comfortably and unrolled <PER>Harry</PER>'s parchment while looking around the room.
Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether how many elves wanted to be or not, <PER>Harry</PER> uncorked <PER>Harry</PER>'s ink bottle, dipped <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill into it, and then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of <PER>Harry</PER>'s parchment, thinking hard But after a minute or so <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say.
<PER>Harry</PER> could now appreciate how hard it had been for <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> to write <PER>Harry</PER> letters over the summer.
How was <PER>Harry</PER> supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions <PER>Harry</PER> was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information <PER>Harry</PER> did not want them to have?
<PER>Harry</PER> sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, <PER>Harry</PER> dipped <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill into the ink bottle once more and set the ink bottle resolutely upon the parchment.
Best, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> reread this letter several times, trying to see this letter from the point of view of an outsider.
<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> could not see how they would know what <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was talking about — or who <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was talking to — just from reading this letter.
<PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about <PER>Hagrid</PER> and tell them when <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> might be back: <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what <PER>Hagrid</PER> might be up to while <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was not at Hogwarts.
She had the unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to Shis boss, yet <PER>Harry</PER> could not see why; <PER>Harry</PER> was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning.
The sun was high in the sky now and when <PER>Harry</PER> entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting.
“Safe flight, then,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> carried her to one of the windows; with a moment’s pressure on his arm Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched them, savoring the fresh air on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, thinking about Quidditch later and then <PER>Harry</PER> saw it.
The whole thing had happened so quickly <PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, except that <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was hammering madly.
him leapt in shock, and turning quickly, saw <PER>Cho</PER> Chang holding a letter and a parcel in <PER>Cho</PER> Chang's hands.
<PER>Cho</PER> coaxed it down onto <PER>Cho</PER>'s arm where it held out an obliging leg so that <PER>Cho</PER> could attach the parcel.
“It’s my friend <PER>Ron</PER> Weasley, d’you know him?” “The Tornado-hater?” said <PER>Cho</PER> rather coolly.
“That <PER>Umbridge</PER> woman’s foul,” That <PER>Umbridge</PER> woman said in a low voice.
Who cared about a stupid flying horse, <PER>Cho</PER> thought <PER>Cho</PER> had been really brave For a moment <PER>Cho</PER> considered accidentally-on-purpose showing <PER>Cho</PER>'s his cut hand as his helped her tie her parcel onto her owl But the very instant that this thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened again.
“I’ve had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!” <PER>Harry</PER> folded <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms and stared at the caretaker.
“Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?” <PER>Cho</PER> was looking from <PER>Harry</PER> to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it.
Filch opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes with <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
There was a moment’s pause in which Filch glared at <PER>Cho</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER> glared right back, then the caretaker turned and shuffled back toward the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER> looked at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER> shrugged; <PER>Harry</PER> was quite as mystified by that as she was, though, oddly, it was not bothering <PER>Harry</PER> very much at the moment.
<PER>Cho</PER> had managed to have an entire conversation with <PER>Cho</PER>'s and not embarrassed <PER>Cho</PER> once You were really brave standing up to <PER>Cho</PER>'s like that <PER>Cho</PER> had called <PER>Cho</PER> brave <PER>Cho</PER> did not hate <PER>Cho</PER> for being alive Of course, <PER>Cho</PER> had preferred Cedric, <PER>Cho</PER> knew that Though if him’d only asked <PER>Cho</PER>'s to the ball before Cedric had, things might have turned out differently <PER>Cho</PER> had seemed sincerely sorry that <PER>Cho</PER> had to refuse when <PER>Harry</PER> had asked <PER>Cho</PER>'s “Morning,” <PER>Harry</PER> said brightly to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, joining them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.
“What are you looking so pleased about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, eyeing <PER>Harry</PER> in surprise.
“Erm Quidditch later,” said <PER>Harry</PER> happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Look, I don’t think you should,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> seriously, “you’re both really behind on homework as it — ” But <PER>Hermione</PER> broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the Daily Prophet was soaring toward <PER>Hermione</PER>'s in the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg; <PER>Hermione</PER> pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper, and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off again.
“Anything interesting?” said <PER>Ron</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> smiled — <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> was keen to get her off the subject of homework.
<PER>Harry</PER> devoted <PER>Harry</PER> to another helping of eggs and bacon; <PER>Ron</PER> was staring up at the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied.
“Oh no Sirius!” “What’s happened?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> snatched at the paper so violently that it ripped down the middle so that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were holding half each.
“<PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I’ll bet anything,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a low, furious voice.
‘Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very dangerous killed thirteen people broke out of Azkaban ’ the usual rubbish,” <PER>Hermione</PER> concluded, laying down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s half of the paper and looking fearfully at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did warn <PER>Dumbledore</PER> not to.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet <PER>Harry</PER> had torn off.
“Hey!” he said, flattening it down so <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> could both see it.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “look this little piece here ” <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> bent closer to read it; the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought it seemed far-fetched; <PER>Hermione</PER>, on the other hand, looked rather impressed and said, “Do you know, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if that were true.” <PER>Hermione</PER> folded up <PER>Hermione</PER>'s half of the newspaper thoughtfully.
When <PER>Harry</PER> laid down <PER>Harry</PER>'s knife and fork <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to come out of a reverie.
“Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on Self-Fertilizing Shrubs first, and if we’re lucky we’ll be able to start <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting <PER>Harry</PER> upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating blue, and <PER>Harry</PER> had not been on <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt for a week “I mean, we can do it tonight,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, as he and <PER>Harry</PER> walked down the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s dire warnings that they would fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing in their ears.
“And we have got plenty of time to do it all” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced over to <PER>Harry</PER>'s right as they approached the Quidditch pitch, to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly.
They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, <PER>Ron</PER> guarding the three tall goalposts, <PER>Harry</PER> playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Ron</PER> was pretty good; <PER>Harry</PER> blocked three-quarters of the goals <PER>Harry</PER> attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced.
After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate lunch, during which <PER>Hermione</PER> made it quite clear that <PER>Hermione</PER> thought they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session.
“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> called in <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s sneering drawl.
<PER>Ron</PER> mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and <PER>Harry</PER> followed him, watching him's ears turn red from behind.
Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to <PER>Harry</PER>, who passed to <PER>Ron</PER>, who dropped it.
<PER>Ron</PER> threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to <PER>Harry</PER>, who passed to George “Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling?” called <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“Come on now, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said Angelina crossly, as <PER>Ron</PER> dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle.
“It’ll clear It up in no time.” “All right,” called Angelina, “Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger; <PER>Ron</PER>, get up to the goalposts, <PER>Harry</PER>, release the Snitch when I say so.
“<PER>Ron</PER>’s making a right pig<PER>Ron</PER>’s ear of things, isn’t he?” muttered George, as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch.
“<PER>Harry</PER> was fine when I was practicing with <PER>Harry</PER> this morning.” “Yeah, well, I hope <PER>Harry</PER> hasn’t peaked too soon,” said Fred gloomily.
When Angelina blew Angelina's whistle, <PER>Harry</PER> released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger; from that moment on, <PER>Harry</PER> was barely aware of what the others were doing.
“<PER>Ron</PER> — you’re not covering your middle post!” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was hovering in front of the left-hand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at Fred, who was looking anxious and checking <PER>Harry</PER>'s pockets.
“How was practice?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> rather coolly half an hour later, as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room.
“Completely lousy,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair beside <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I suppose he could’ve played better,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, “but it was only the first training session, like you said” Neither <PER>Harry</PER> nor <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to make much headway with their homework that night.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Ron</PER> was too preoccupied with how badly <PER>Harry</PER> had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the chant of “Gryffindor are losers” out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
By the evening <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though somebody had been beating <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain against the inside of <PER>Harry</PER>'s skull.
“You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ron</PER>, as they finally laid aside Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra ’s equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter’s moons.
“Listen shall we just ask <PER>Hermione</PER> if we can have a look at what <PER>Hermione</PER>’s done?” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced over at <PER>Hermione</PER>; <PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting with Crookshanks on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lap and chatting merrily to <PER>Ginny</PER> as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of <PER>Hermione</PER>, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks.
“Jupiter’s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,” she said, pointing over <PER>Ron</PER>’s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, “and it’s Io that’s got the volcanos.” “Thanks,” snarled <PER>Ron</PER>, scratching out the offending sentences.
“Sorry, I only — ” “Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize — “<PER>Ron</PER> — ” “I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I’m up to my neck in it here — ” “No — look!” <PER>Hermione</PER> was pointing to the nearest window.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both looked over.
<PER>Ron</PER> took it off and the owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across <PER>Ron</PER>’s drawing of the moon Io.
“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: To <PER>Ron</PER>ald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts.
he thrust the letter at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who leaned toward each other to read it together: Dear <PER>Ron</PER>, I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister of Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations.
Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you will say that Potter has always been <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s favorite — but I feel bound to tell you that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different — and probably more accurate — view of Potters behavior.
Your loyalty, <PER>Ron</PER>, should be not to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but to the school and the Ministry.
I am very sorry to hear that so far Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> is encountering very little cooperation from staff as Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> should find this easier from next week — again, see the Prophet tomorrow!
It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under our parents's roof while our parents remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around <PER>Dumbledore</PER> (if you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell Mother's that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry.
Your brother, Percy <PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Come on, we’ve got to get this finished some time before dawn,” he said briskly to <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling Professor Sinistra ’s essay back toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was looking at <PER>Ron</PER> with an odd expression on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“Thanks a million, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> weakly, passing over <PER>Harry</PER>'s essay and sinking back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s armchair, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> also felt an odd, sick, empty feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought <PER>Harry</PER> strange, even mad; <PER>Harry</PER> knew that the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to <PER>Harry</PER> for months, but there was something about seeing it written down like that in Percy’s writing, about knowing that Percy was advising <PER>Ron</PER> to drop him and even to tell tales on him to <PER>Umbridge</PER>, that made him's situation real to him as nothing else had.
And with a surge of sympathy for Percy's godfather, <PER>Harry</PER> thought that Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment, because Sirius was in the same situation; nearly everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a great <PER>Voldemort</PER> supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years <PER>Harry</PER> blinked.
No it could not have been He had imagined it because He had been thinking about Sirius “Okay, write that down,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said to <PER>Ron</PER>, pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to <PER>Ron</PER>, “and then copy out this conclusion that I’ve written for you.” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, you are honestly the most wonderful person I’ve ever met,” said <PER>Ron</PER> weakly, “and if I’m ever rude to you again — ” “ — I’ll know you’re back to normal,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra, Europa’s covered in ice, not mice — <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> had slid off <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames.
“Er — <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly.
<PER>Harry</PER> spoke quite calmly; after all, <PER>Harry</PER> had seen Sirius’s head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it too.
Nevertheless, <PER>Harry</PER> could not be sure that <PER>Harry</PER> had really seen it this time It had vanished so quickly “Sirius’s head?” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated.
“Well, I think a girl — first year by the look of her — might’ve got a glimpse of me earlier, but don’t worry,” Sirius said hastily, as <PER>Hermione</PER> clapped a hand to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth.
“This was the only way I could come up with of answering <PER>Harry</PER>’s letter without resorting to a code — and codes are breakable.” At the mention of <PER>Harry</PER>’s letter, <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had both turned to stare at him.
“I forgot,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, which was perfectly true; his meeting with <PER>Cho</PER> in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind.
“Anyway, we’d better be quick, just in case we’re disturbed — your scar.” “What about — ?” <PER>Ron</PER> began, but <PER>Hermione</PER> said quickly, “We’ll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.” “Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but We don’t think it’s anything to really worry about.
“So you don’t think it had anything to do with <PER>Umbridge</PER> touching me when I was in detention with her?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
“I know her by reputation and I’m sure her’s no Death Eater — ” “She’s foul enough to be one,” said <PER>Harry</PER> darkly and <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded vigorously in agreement.
“I know she’s a nasty piece of work, though — you should hear Remus talk about she.” “Does Lupin know she?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, remembering <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s comments about dangerous half-breeds during shis first lesson.
“No,” said Sirius, “but she drafted a bit of anti- werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.” <PER>Harry</PER> remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days and <PER>Harry</PER>'s dislike of <PER>Umbridge</PER> deepened even further.
“Honestly, if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher I’m sure he’d respond, after all, you are the only member of his family he’s got left, and Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said — ” “So what are <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s lessons like?” “Sirius interrupted.
“Is she training you all to kill half- breeds?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>’s affronted look at being cut off in her defense of Kreacher.
“What does he think we’re doing here, forming some sort of wizard army?” “That’s exactly what he thinks you’re doing,” said Sirius, “or rather, that’s exactly what he’s afraid <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s doing — forming <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own private army, with which <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic.” There was a pause at this, then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with.” “So we’re being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we’ll use spells against the Ministry?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking furious.
“So you haven’t had any news about <PER>Hagrid</PER>, either?” “Ah ” said Sirius, “well, he was supposed to be back by now, no one’s sure what’s happened to he.” Then, seeing their stricken faces, he added quickly, “But <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s not worried, so don’t you three get yourselves in a state; I’m sure <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s fine.” “But if he was supposed to be back by now ” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a small, worried voice.
“Madame Maxime was with Madame Maxime, we’ve been in touch with her and her says they got separated on the journey home — but there’s nothing to suggest he’s hurt or — well, nothing to suggest he’s not perfectly okay.” Unconvinced, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged worried looks.
“Listen, don’t go asking too many questions about <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said Sirius hastily, “it’ll just draw even more attention to the fact that he’s not back, and I know <PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t want that.
“Something <PER>Malfoy</PER> said on the train made us think Something <PER>Malfoy</PER> knew it was you, and Something <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s father was on the platform, Sirius — you know, <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> — so don’t come up here, whatever you do, if <PER>Malfoy</PER> recognizes you again — ” “All right, all right, I’ve got the point,” said Sirius.
“The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James.” “Look — ” “Well, I’d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,” said Sirius, but <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> was lying.
However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when <PER>Hermione</PER> let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline: “ “High Inquisitor’?” said <PER>Harry</PER> darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast slipping from his fingers.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> has been offered this position in addition to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s own teaching post, and we are delighted to say that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> has accepted.’ “The Ministry’s new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together, staring at him.
“Oh, I can’t wait to see <PER>McGonagall</PER> inspected,” said <PER>Ron</PER> happily.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> won’t know what’s hit <PER>Umbridge</PER>.” “Well, come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, jumping up, “we’d better get going, if <PER>Hermione</PER>’s inspecting Binns’s class we don’t want to be late” But <PER>Umbridge</PER> was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> in <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where <PER>Harry</PER>’s moonstone essay was handed back to <PER>Harry</PER> with a large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner.
“I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,” said <PER>Snape</PER> with a smirk, as <PER>Snape</PER> swept among them, passing back them's homework.
Determined not to give <PER>Snape</PER> an excuse to fail him this lesson, <PER>Harry</PER> read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them.
His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s but it was at least blue rather than pink, like <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s, and His delivered a flask of it to <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief.
“And the homework didn’t go too badly either, did it?” When neither <PER>Ron</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> answered, she pressed on, “I mean, all right, I didn’t expect the top grade, not if he’s marking to O.W.L.
“Obviously, I’d have been thrilled if I’d gotten an O — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> sharply, “if you want to know what grades we got, ask.” “I don’t — I didn’t mean — well, if you want to tell me “I got a P,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, ladling soup into his bowl.
<PER>Harry</PER> laughed again, though <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure whether or not George was joking.
<PER>Harry</PER> imagined trying to conceal from <PER>Hermione</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had received T’s in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on.
“Charms.” “What was it like?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> asked together.
“Trelawney — ” “A T if ever I saw one — ” “ — and <PER>Umbridge</PER> herself.” “Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with <PER>Umbridge</PER> today,” said George.
“Angelina’ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.” But <PER>Harry</PER> did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pulling out <PER>Harry</PER>'s dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when <PER>Ron</PER> elbowed <PER>Harry</PER> in the ribs and, looking round, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> emerging through the trapdoor in the floor.
“Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> with Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s wide smile.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> covertly.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent <PER>Harry</PER>'s head hurriedly over <PER>Harry</PER>'s book.
“Think of a dream, quick,” he told <PER>Ron</PER>, “in case the old toad comes our way.” “I did it last time,” <PER>Ron</PER> protested, “it’s your turn, you tell me one.” “Oh, I dunno ” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days.
“Okay, we’ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject would that be ‘drowning’ or ‘cauldron’ or ‘<PER>Snape</PER>’?” “It doesn’t matter, pick any of them,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, chancing a glance behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was now standing at Professor Trelawney’s shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned <PER>Neville</PER> about the Divination teacher's dream diary.
“I dunno, last night, whenever you like,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to listen to what <PER>Umbridge</PER> was saying to Professor Trelawney.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was making another note on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew she up to shis full height, shis beads and bangles clinking.
“I see,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> softly, making yet another note on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s clipboard.
“Let me see the start you’ve made on your dream diary, please.” And by the time she had interpreted <PER>Harry</PER>’s dreams at the top of shis voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), <PER>Harry</PER> was feeling much less sympathetic toward she.
All the while, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> descended the silver ladder first so that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before <PER>Hermione</PER> could ask any questions Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had called them all to order and silence fell.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year’s lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when <PER>Harry</PER> noticed that <PER>Hermione</PER> had <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand in the air again.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had noticed too, and what was more, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality.
Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed <PER>Hermione</PER>, she got to shis feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, “What is it this time, Miss Granger?” “I’ve already read chapter two,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“He says ‘counterjinx’ is just a name people give people's jinxes when people want to make people sound more acceptable.” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> raised her eyebrows, and <PER>Harry</PER> knew she was impressed against shis will.
“You disagree?” “Yes, I do,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who, unlike <PER>Umbridge</PER>, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the class’s attention.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not complain during the evening’s detention; <PER>Harry</PER> was determined not to give <PER>Umbridge</PER> the satisfaction; over and over again <PER>Harry</PER> wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips, though the cut deepened with every letter.
“Are you telling me,” she said, lowering shis voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, “that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s class again?” “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, speaking to the floor.
Angelina gave <PER>Harry</PER> a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which <PER>Harry</PER> flung himself onto the bench beside <PER>Ron</PER>, fuming.
“You think <PER>McGonagall</PER> was right, do you?” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily to the picture of <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge obscuring <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s face.
“I wish she hadn’t taken points from you, but I think she’s right to warn you not to lose your temper with <PER>Umbridge</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not speak to <PER>Hermione</PER> all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration <PER>Harry</PER> forgot <PER>Harry</PER>'s anger; Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head.
“Let’s see <PER>Umbridge</PER> get what <PER>Umbridge</PER> deserves.” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was there.
“Mister Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown, please take this box of mice — don’t be silly, girl, they won’t hurt you — and hand one to each student — ” “Hem, hem,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on the first night of term.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> ignored Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Seamus handed back <PER>Harry</PER>’s essay; <PER>Harry</PER> took it without looking at <PER>Harry</PER> and saw, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s relief, that <PER>Harry</PER> had managed an A.
“Yes?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning round, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line.
“I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec — ” “Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning her back firmly on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> did not follow Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought that Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> would not permit it.
she did, however, take many more notes while she sat in shis corner, and when Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim expression on Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s face.
As they filed out of the classroom, <PER>Harry</PER> saw Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> approach the teacher’s desk; <PER>Harry</PER> nudged <PER>Ron</PER>, who nudged <PER>Hermione</PER> in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop.
“Thirty-nine years this December,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> brusquely, snapping Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s bag shut.
“Very well,” she said, “you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days’ time.” “I can hardly wait,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> in a coldly indifferent voice, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> strode off toward the door.
“Hurry up, you three,” she added, sweeping <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> before her.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn <PER>Harry</PER> received one in return.
<PER>Harry</PER> had thought that the next time <PER>Harry</PER> would see <PER>Umbridge</PER> would be in <PER>Harry</PER>'s detention that evening, but <PER>Harry</PER> was wrong.
“I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor <PER>Hagrid</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> exchanged uneasy looks with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; <PER>Malfoy</PER> would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on <PER>Hagrid</PER> to a member of the Ministry.
“Hmm,” said Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, dropping her voice, though <PER>Harry</PER> could still hear her quite clearly, “I wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — can you tell me what is causing Professor <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s very extended leave of absence?” <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> look up eagerly.
Most people were able to answer well and <PER>Harry</PER>’s spirits lifted somewhat; at least this class was not letting <PER>Hagrid</PER> down.
“No, I’m very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.” Looking politely incredulous, <PER>Umbridge</PER> made a tiny note on <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s clipboard and went on, “And what are you planning to cover with this class this year — assuming, of course, that Professor <PER>Hagrid</PER> does not return?” “Oh, I’ll take them through the creatures that most often come up in O.W.L.,” said Professor Grubbly- Plank.
“Not much left to do — they’ve studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we’d cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know” “Well, you seem to know what you’re doing, at any rate,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, making a very obvious tick on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s clipboard.
“Only because he was too stupid to listen to what <PER>Hagrid</PER> told him to do,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
Both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> groaned.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> turned her head slowly in <PER>Harry</PER>’s direction.
ie ie ie It was nearly midnight when <PER>Harry</PER> left <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office that night, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf <PER>Harry</PER> had wrapped around it.
<PER>Harry</PER> expected the common room to be empty when <PER>Harry</PER> returned, but <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had sat up waiting for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see them, especially as <PER>Hermione</PER> was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical.
“Here,” she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward <PER>Harry</PER>, “soak your hand in that, it’s a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.” <PER>Harry</PER> placed help.” <PER>Harry</PER>'s bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief.
“<PER>McGonagall</PER> would go nuts if she knew — ” “Yeah, she probably would,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And how long d’you reckon it’d take <PER>Umbridge</PER> to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?” <PER>Ron</PER> opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way.
“You know, I was thinking today” She shot a slightly nervous look at <PER>Harry</PER> and then plunged on, “I was thinking that — maybe the time’s come when we should just — just do it we.” “Do what we?” said <PER>Harry</PER> suspiciously, still floating <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> goggled at her.
“Don’t be silly, of course there is!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W.
“It’s about preparing ourselves, like <PER>Harry</PER> said in <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s first lesson, for what’s waiting out there.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> turned to <PER>Ron</PER>, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when <PER>Hermione</PER> elaborated on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W.
To <PER>Harry</PER>’s consternation, however, <PER>Ron</PER> did not look exasperated.
“Teaching us to do it.” “But ” <PER>Harry</PER> was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling <PER>Harry</PER>'s leg.
“But I’m not a teacher, I can’t — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Uh first year — you saved the Stone from <PER>Voldemort</PER>.” “But that was luck,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “that wasn’t skill — ” “Second year,” <PER>Ron</PER> interrupted, “you killed the basilisk and destroyed <PER>Riddle</PER>.” “Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I — ” “Third year,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, louder still, “you fought off about a hundred dementors at once — ” “You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn’t “Last year,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, almost shouting now, “you fought off <PER>Voldemort</PER> again — ” “Listen to me!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, almost angrily, because <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were both smirking now.
Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s smiles had vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> was feeling ashamed of <PER>Harry</PER>'s outburst already.
<PER>Harry</PER> nodded, hardly aware of what <PER>Harry</PER> was agreeing to.
“Well, I’m off to bed,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said in a voice that was clearly as natural as <PER>Hermione</PER> could make it.
<PER>Hermione</PER> made no mention of <PER>Harry</PER> giving Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after <PER>Hermione</PER>'s original suggestion.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s detentions with <PER>Umbridge</PER> were finally over (<PER>Harry</PER> doubted whether the words now etched on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand would ever fade entirely); <PER>Ron</PER> had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to vanish them's mice in Transfiguration (<PER>Hermione</PER> had actually progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for <PER>Snape</PER>.
“I was wondering,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said suddenly, “whether you’d thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “ ’Course I have,” said <PER>Harry</PER> grumpily.
“Can’t forget it, can we, with that hag teaching we — ” “I meant the idea <PER>Ron</PER> and I had” — <PER>Ron</PER> cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look; she frowned at him — “oh, all right, the idea !
Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night <PER>Hermione</PER> had proposed it, but at others, he had found he thinking about the spells that had served he best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters — found he, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons “Well,” he said slowly, when he could not pretend to find Asiatic anti-venoms interesting much longer, “yeah, I — I’ve thought about it a bit.” “And?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> eagerly.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up at <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I thought it was a good idea from the start,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure that <PER>Harry</PER> was not going to start shouting again.
<PER>Harry</PER> shifted uncomfortably in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
“You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn’t you?” “Yes, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> gently, “but all the same, there’s no point pretending that you’re not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts, because you are.
“He said <PER>Harry</PER> knew how to do stuff even <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t, and <PER>Harry</PER> was in the final year at Durmstrang.” <PER>Ron</PER> was looking at <PER>Hermione</PER> suspiciously.
“You’re not still in contact with him, are you?” “So what if I am?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> coolly, though <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face was a little pink.
<PER>Hermione</PER> shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head exasperatedly and, ignoring <PER>Ron</PER>, who was continuing to watch her, said to <PER>Harry</PER>, “Well, what do you think?
“Because,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, returning to the diagram of the Chinese <PER>Cho</PER>mping Cabbage she was copying, “I don’t think <PER>Umbridge</PER> would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.” <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying <PER>Harry</PER>.
Sirius had maintained a stony silence since <PER>Harry</PER> had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; <PER>Harry</PER> knew they had made <PER>Harry</PER> angry by saying that they did not want <PER>Harry</PER> to come — but <PER>Harry</PER> still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway.
What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>?
“Well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and about,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, when <PER>Harry</PER> discussed him's fears with him and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“The trouble is,” she said to <PER>Harry</PER>, “until V-<PER>Voldemort</PER> — oh for heaven’s sake, <PER>Ron</PER> — comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn’t <PER>Ron</PER> —?
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d go mad if he did and Sirius listens to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> even if he doesn’t like what he hears.” When <PER>Harry</PER> continued to look worried, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Listen, <PER>Ron</PER> and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested.
“Don’t worry, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said quietly.
<PER>Ron</PER> was even further behind with his work than <PER>Harry</PER>, because while they both had Quidditch practices twice a week, <PER>Ron</PER> also had prefect duties.
With a slight pang, <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that if it hadn’t been for Sirius, <PER>Harry</PER> would not have been going at all.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and <PER>Harry</PER> walked on, out onto the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.
“Er — why was Filch sniffing you?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, as he, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, very skeptically.
“The Three Broomsticks?” “Oh — no,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, coming out of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s reverie, “no, it’s always packed and really noisy.
The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as <PER>Harry</PER> stepped onto it <PER>Harry</PER> realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Hagrid</PER> mentioning this pub in his first year: “Yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head,” Yeh had said, explaining how Yeh had won a dragons egg from a hooded stranger there.
At the time <PER>Harry</PER> had wondered why <PER>Hagrid</PER> had not found it odd that the stranger kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s face hidden throughout their encounter; now <PER>Harry</PER> saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog’s Head.
“I don’t know about this, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, as they crossed to the bar.
“Has it occurred to you <PER>Umbridge</PER> might be under that?” <PER>Hermione</PER> cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure.
“And anyway, even if <PER>Umbridge</PER> does come in here there’s nothing she can do to stop us, <PER>Harry</PER>, because I’ve double- and triple-checked the school rules.
<PER>Harry</PER> was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to <PER>Harry</PER>.
The barman’s eyes traveled over <PER>Harry</PER>, resting for a fraction of a second on <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> turned away and deposited <PER>Harry</PER>’s money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> retreated to the farthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages rapped the counter with the man in the dirty gray bandages's knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman.
“Yeah “So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, wrenching open the rusty top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s butterbeer and taking a swig.
“Just a couple of people,” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated, checking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s watch and then looking anxiously toward the door.
First came <PER>Neville</PER> with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (<PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach did a back flip) <PER>Cho</PER> and one of <PER>Cho</PER>'s usually giggling girlfriends, then (on <PER>Cho</PER>'s own and looking so dreamy that <PER>Cho</PER> might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name <PER>Harry</PER> did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot; <PER>Ginny</PER>, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom <PER>Harry</PER> recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko’s merchandise.
“A couple of people?” said <PER>Harry</PER> hoarsely to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What are they expecting?” “I’ve told you, they just want to hear what you’ve got to say,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> soothingly; but <PER>Harry</PER> continued to look at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s so furiously that <PER>Hermione</PER> added quickly, “You don’t have to do anything yet, I’ll speak to them first.” “Hi, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, beaming and taking a seat opposite <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to smile back, but did not speak; <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth was exceptionally dry.
<PER>Cho</PER> had just smiled at <PER>Harry</PER> and sat down on <PER>Ron</PER>’s right.
<PER>Cho</PER> friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave <PER>Harry</PER> a thoroughly mistrustful look that told <PER>Harry</PER> plainly that, given her way, her would not be here at all.
In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space.
<PER>Cho</PER>’s friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down <PER>Cho</PER>’s friend, Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch, Padma Patil shuddered, and <PER>Neville</PER> gave an odd yelp that Padma Patil managed to turn into a cough.
“Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believes it — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> began.
“You mean, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> believes <PER>Dumbledore</PER>,” said the blond boy, nodding at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “and I think we’ve got the right to know exactly what makes him say <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back.” “Look,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, intervening swiftly, “that’s really not what this meeting was supposed to be about — ” “It’s okay, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt that <PER>Hermione</PER> should have seen this coming.
“What makes me say <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s back?” <PER>Voldemort</PER> asked, looking Zacharias straight in the face.
“I never knew that!” “Mum told <PER>Ron</PER> not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; <PER>Harry</PER> was determinedly looking anywhere but at <PER>Cho</PER>.
“And in our first year,” said <PER>Neville</PER> to the group at large, “<PER>Harry</PER> saved that Sorcerous Stone — ” “Sorcerer’s,” hissed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Yes, that, from <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” finished <PER>Neville</PER>.
“And that’s not to mention,” said <PER>Cho</PER> (<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes snapped onto <PER>Cho</PER>, <PER>Cho</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, smiling; <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach did another somersault), “all the tasks <PER>Harry</PER> had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year — getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and things” There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table.
<PER>Harry</PER> was trying to arrange <PER>Harry</PER>'s face so that <PER>Harry</PER> did not look too pleased with <PER>Harry</PER>.
The fact that <PER>Cho</PER> had just praised <PER>Harry</PER> made it much, much harder for <PER>Harry</PER> to say the thing <PER>Harry</PER> had sworn to <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> would tell them.
“Here’s an idea,” said <PER>Ron</PER> loudly, before <PER>Harry</PER> could speak, “why don’t you shut your mouth?” Perhaps the word “weasel” had affected <PER>Ron</PER> particularly strongly; in any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump Zacharias.
“Yes, well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily, “moving on the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from <PER>Harry</PER>?” There was a murmur of general agreement.
“I’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, slightly impatiently, “but you know, this is rather important, we’re talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s Death Eaters — ” “Well said!” barked Ernie Macmillan, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had been expecting to speak long before this.
“Great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of — ” “They don’t exist, <PER>Neville</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tartly.
“There are plenty of eyewitness accounts, just because you’re so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you — ” “Hem, hem,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> in such a good imitation of Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “<PER>McGonagall</PER> might let us have hers, hers did when <PER>Harry</PER> was practicing for the Tri wizard” But <PER>Harry</PER> was pretty certain that <PER>McGonagall</PER> would not be so accommodating this time.
For all that <PER>Hermione</PER> had said about study and homework groups being allowed, <PER>Harry</PER> had the distinct feeling this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.
<PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyebrows at him.
“And if this list was found well, I mean to say you said yourself, if <PER>Umbridge</PER> finds out ” “You just said this group was the most important thing you’d do this year,” <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I — yes, of course I’ll sign.” Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Cho</PER>’s friend give <PER>Cho</PER>'s a rather reproachful look before adding <PER>Cho</PER>'s name.
When the last person — Zacharias — had signed, <PER>Hermione</PER> took the parchment back and slipped the parchment carefully into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag.
<PER>Cho</PER> made rather a business of fastening the catch on <PER>Cho</PER>'s bag before leaving, <PER>Cho</PER>'s long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide <PER>Cho</PER>'s face, but <PER>Cho</PER>'s friend stood beside <PER>Cho</PER>, arms folded, clicking <PER>Cho</PER>'s tongue, so that <PER>Cho</PER> had little choice but to leave with <PER>Cho</PER>.
As her friend ushered her through the door, <PER>Cho</PER> looked back and waved at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, I think that went quite well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> happily, as <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> walked out of the Hog’s Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> still clutching their bottles of butterbeer.
“She’s going out with — my sister’s going — what d’you mean, Michael Corner?” “Well, that’s why he and his friends came, I think — well, they’re obviously interested in learning defense, but if <PER>Ginny</PER> hadn’t told Michael what was going on — “When did this — when did she — ?” “They met at the Yule Ball and They got together at the end of last year,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> composedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> followed her.
“Big surprise,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath.
“But,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, following <PER>Hermione</PER> along a row of quills in copper pots, “I thought <PER>Ginny</PER> fancied <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at him rather pityingly and shook <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> used to fancy <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Ginny</PER> gave up on <PER>Harry</PER> months ago.
<PER>Harry</PER>, whose head was still full of <PER>Cho</PER>’s parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as <PER>Ron</PER>, who was positively quivering with indignation, but this subject did bring something home to him that until now him had not really registered.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> never used to talk in front of me.” “Exactly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, “this is exactly why <PER>Ginny</PER> hasn’t told you <PER>Ginny</PER>’s seeing Michael, <PER>Ginny</PER> knew you’d take it badly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> rolled her eyes at <PER>Harry</PER> and then said in an undertone, while <PER>Ron</PER> was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, “And talking about Michael and <PER>Ginny</PER> what about <PER>Cho</PER> and you?” “What d’you mean?” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly.
“Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, smiling slightly, “<PER>Hermione</PER> just couldn’t keep <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes off you, could <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt happier for the rest of the weekend than <PER>Harry</PER> had done all term.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> spent much of Sunday catching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room, they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake.
The knowledge that they were doing something to resist <PER>Umbridge</PER> and the Ministry, and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave <PER>Harry</PER> a feeling of immense satisfaction.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept reliving Saturday’s meeting in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind: all those people, coming to <PER>Harry</PER> to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts and the looks on all those people's faces as they had heard some of the things <PER>Harry</PER> had done and <PER>Cho</PER> praising <PER>Harry</PER>'s performance in the Triwizard Tournament The knowledge that all those people did not think <PER>Harry</PER> a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed <PER>Harry</PER> up so much that <PER>Harry</PER> was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all him's least favorite classes.
Signed: Dolores Jane <PER>Umbridge</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> read the notice over the heads of some anxious-looking second years.
“Or — I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look too — ” “I wonder if <PER>Hermione</PER>’s seen this yet?” <PER>Harry</PER> said, looking around at the door to the girls’ dormitories.
There was a brief moment when <PER>Ron</PER> tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backward and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet.
“Er — I don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’ dormitories,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and trying not to laugh.
“Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?” they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>’s allowed in our dormitory, how come our’re not allowed — ?” “Well, it’s an old-fashioned rule,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had just slid neatly onto a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet, “but it says in Hogwarts, A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls.
“You’re so naive,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “you think just because you’re all honorable and trustworthy — ” “No, they can’t have done because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly.
“Believe me, if anyone’s run off and told <PER>Umbridge</PER>, well know exactly who they are and they will really regret it.” “What’ll happen to them?” said <PER>Ron</PER> eagerly.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had barely taken <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s seats when <PER>Neville</PER>, Dean, Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> descended upon them.
“The prefects as well?” said Fred, looking quizzically at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Cho</PER> was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend <PER>Cho</PER> had brought along to the Hog’s Head.
Would <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s notice scare <PER>Cho</PER>'s off meeting them again?
“It’s okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, when she was near enough to hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Don’t worry, I’ll behave myself” “Bet <PER>Umbridge</PER> is in History of Magic,” said <PER>Ron</PER> grimly, as they set off for Binns’s lesson.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not even attempt to follow what <PER>Harry</PER> was saying today; <PER>Harry</PER> doodled idly on <PER>Harry</PER>'s parchment ignoring <PER>Hermione</PER>’s frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily.
<PER>Harry</PER> slipped quietly off <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair, crouched down, and hurried along the row to the window, where <PER>Harry</PER> slid the catch and opened it very slowly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had expected Hedwig to hold out Hedwig's leg so that <PER>Harry</PER> could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully.
<PER>Harry</PER> closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, crouched low again, and sped back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat with Hedwig on <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Harry</PER> regained <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat, transferred Hedwig to <PER>Harry</PER>'s lap, and made to remove the letter tied to Hedwig's leg.
“She’s hurt!” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, bending <PER>Harry</PER>'s head low over her.
<PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> leaned in closer; <PER>Hermione</PER> even put down her quill.
“Professor Binns,” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Not at all well,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet while concealing Hedwig behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back.
“Yes yes, hospital wing well, off you go, then, Perkins ” Once outside the room <PER>Harry</PER> returned Hedwig to <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when <PER>Harry</PER> was out of sight of Binns’s door.
<PER>Harry</PER> first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been <PER>Hagrid</PER>, of course, but as His had no idea where <PER>Hagrid</PER> was, his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would help.
As <PER>Harry</PER> approached, one of Two stone gargoyles croaked, “You should be in class, sunny Jim.” “This is urgent,” said <PER>Harry</PER> curtly.
“Well, that’s put us in us place, hasn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER> knocked; <PER>Harry</PER> heard footsteps and then the door opened and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> face-to-face with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“It’s my owl, she’s injured.” “Injured owl, did you say?” Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, lifting Hedwig carefully off <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, “she turned up after the other post owls and shis wing’s all funny, look — ” Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from <PER>Harry</PER> while Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> watched.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, however, looked sharply at <PER>Harry</PER> and said, “Do you know how far this owl’s traveled, Potter?” “Er,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared into the staffroom carrying Hedwig, who was staring at <PER>Harry</PER> as though unable to believe <PER>Harry</PER> would give her away like this.
Feeling slightly guilty, <PER>Harry</PER> turned to go, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> called <PER>Harry</PER> back.
“Bear in mind,” She said quickly and quietly, Shis eyes on the scroll in his hand, “that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched, won’t you?” “I — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staffroom, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd.
Here he spotted <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> already standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up against the wind.
<PER>Harry</PER> slit open the scroll as <PER>Harry</PER> hurried toward them and found five words in Sirius’s handwriting: Today, same time, same place.
“Where did you take <PER>Hermione</PER>?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“And I met <PER>McGonagall</PER> Listen” And <PER>Harry</PER> told them what <PER>McGonagall</PER> had said.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking from <PER>Ron</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER> and back again.
“I just hope nobody else has read this” “But it was still sealed and everything,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to convince <PER>Harry</PER> as much as her.
“And nobody would understand what it meant if they didn’t know where we’d spoken to <PER>Harry</PER> before, would they?” “I don’t know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously, hitching <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag back over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoulder as the bell rang again.
“It wouldn’t be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by magic And if anyone’s watching the Floo Network but I don’t really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted too!” They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all three of They lost in thought, but as They reached the bottom of the stairs they were recalled to they by the voice of <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was standing just outside <PER>Snape</PER>’s classroom door, waving around an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word.
“It’s what he wants” “I mean,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, raising his voice a little more, his gray eyes glittering malevolently in <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s direction, “if it’s a question of influence with the Ministry, I don’t think they’ve got much chance From what my father says, they’ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years And as for Potter my father says it’s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St. Mungo’s apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic” <PER>Malfoy</PER> made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling.
Something collided hard with <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder, knocking <PER>Harry</PER> sideways.
A split second later he realized that <PER>Neville</PER> had just charged past him, heading straight for <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, no!” <PER>Harry</PER> leapt forward and seized the back of <PER>Neville</PER>’s robes; <PER>Neville</PER> struggled frantically, <PER>Harry</PER>'s fists flailing, trying desperately to get at <PER>Malfoy</PER> who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked.
“Help me!” <PER>Harry</PER> flung at <PER>Ron</PER>, managing to get an arm around <PER>Neville</PER>’s neck and dragging <PER>Harry</PER> backward, away from the Slytherins.
<PER>Ron</PER> hurried forward and seized <PER>Neville</PER>’s arms; together, he and <PER>Harry</PER> succeeded in dragging <PER>Neville</PER> back into the Gryffindor line.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s face was scarlet; the pressure <PER>Harry</PER> was exerting on <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat rendered <PER>Harry</PER> quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
<PER>Snape</PER> black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were wrestling with <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?” <PER>Snape</PER> said in <PER>Snape</PER>'s cold, sneering voice.
“I had to stop you,” <PER>Harry</PER> gasped, picking up <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag.
“Crabbe and Goyle would’ve torn you apart.” <PER>Neville</PER> said nothing, <PER>Neville</PER> merely snatched up <PER>Neville</PER>'s own bag and stalked off into the dungeon.
“What in the name of Merlin,” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly, as they followed <PER>Neville</PER>, “was that about?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St. Mungo’s because of magical damage to people who were in St. Mungo’s's brains was highly distressing to <PER>Neville</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> had sworn to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> would not tell anyone <PER>Neville</PER>’s secret.
Even <PER>Neville</PER> did not know that <PER>Harry</PER> knew.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> took their usual seats at the back of the class and pulled out parchment, quills, and their copies of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.
The class around them was whispering about what <PER>Neville</PER> had just done, but when <PER>Snape</PER> closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang everybody fell silent immediately.
“You will notice,” said <PER>Snape</PER> in <PER>Snape</PER>'s low, sneering voice, “that we have a guest with us today.” He gestured toward the dim corner of the dungeon, and <PER>Harry</PER> saw Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> sitting there, clipboard on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s knee.
He glanced sideways at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, his eyebrows raised.
<PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Umbridge</PER>, the two teachers he hated most it was hard to decide which he wanted to triumph over the other.
<PER>Harry</PER> was very interested in hearing her question <PER>Snape</PER>, so interested, that <PER>Harry</PER> was becoming careless with <PER>Harry</PER>'s potion again.
“Salamander blood, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> moaned, grabbing his wrist to prevent his adding the wrong ingredient for the third time.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> had just gotten to <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s feet.
His eyes on <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> added a few drops to <PER>Harry</PER>'s potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange.
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> asked <PER>Snape</PER>.
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?” “Yes,” said <PER>Snape</PER> quietly, barely moving <PER>Snape</PER>'s lips.
“Do you have any idea why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> has consistently refused to appoint you?” asked <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“I suggest you ask <PER>Umbridge</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER> jerkily.
“I suppose this is relevant?” <PER>Snape</PER> asked, <PER>Snape</PER>'s black eyes narrowed.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> and their eyes met for a second.
<PER>Harry</PER> hastily dropped <PER>Harry</PER>'s gaze to <PER>Harry</PER>'s potion, which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber.
“No marks again, then, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> maliciously, emptying <PER>Harry</PER>’s cauldron with a wave of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Snape</PER> had already given them homework, and <PER>Snape</PER> had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights.
“I’ll pretend to be ill and do <PER>Snape</PER>’s essay instead, then I won’t have to stay up half the night” “You can’t skive off Divination,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> severely.
“I just think her’s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud But <PER>Harry</PER>’s already missed History of Magic and I don’t think <PER>Harry</PER> ought to miss anything else today!” There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later <PER>Harry</PER> took <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat in the hot, over- perfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom feeling angry at everybody.
Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and swept away, her lips pursed; her threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus’s head, and thrust the final one into <PER>Neville</PER>’s chest with such force that Professor Trelawney slipped off Professor Trelawney's pouf.
<PER>Harry</PER>, however, thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew what was the matter.
may well choose to leave the indignity of it on probation we shall see how she dares ” “You and <PER>Umbridge</PER> have got something in common,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly when they met again in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter, entitled The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack.’ There will be — ” “ — no need to talk,” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> said together under their breaths.
“No Quidditch practice,” said Angelina in hollow tones when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> entered the common room that night after dinner.
“She’s given the Slytherins permission, why not us?” But <PER>Harry</PER> could imagine how much <PER>Umbridge</PER> was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon.
“Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “look on the bright side — at least now you’ll have time to do <PER>Snape</PER>’s essay!” “That’s a bright side, is it?” snapped <PER>Harry</PER>, while <PER>Ron</PER> stared incredulously at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“No Quidditch practice and extra Potions?” <PER>Harry</PER> slumped down into a chair, dragged <PER>Harry</PER>'s Potions essay reluctantly from <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, and set to work.
Lee Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing Spell <PER>Snape</PER> kept using on <PER>Harry</PER>’s potions.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was not helping matters; the cheers and sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George’s bucket were punctuated by loud and disapproving sniffs that <PER>Harry</PER> found, if anything, more distracting.
“they’re quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves, and I can’t find a rule that says the other idiots aren’t entitled to buy the other idiots, not unless the other idiots’re proven to be dangerous in some way, and it doesn’t look as though they are” She, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> watched George projectile-vomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew, and straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, they’ve got about twenty-six Galleons already” It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasleys dispersed, and then Fred, Lee, and George sat up counting Lee, and George's takings even longer, so that it was well past midnight when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> finally had the common room to themselves again.
As he put his books away, <PER>Ron</PER>, who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, looked blearily into the fire and said, “Sirius!” <PER>Harry</PER> whipped around; Sirius’s untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again.
“Hi,” chorused <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, all three kneeling down upon the hearthrug.
“Not that good,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers.
“You’ve got a lot to learn, <PER>Hermione</PER>.” “Who overheard us?” <PER>Harry</PER> demanded.
“What was <PER>Harry</PER> doing in the Hog’s Head?” “What do you think <PER>Harry</PER> was doing?” said Sirius impatiently.
“D’you think your father and I would’ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” “But — last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks — ” “Last year all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said Sirius impatiently.
“This year we know that there’s someone outside Hogwarts who’d like to kill us all, so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!” “And if we do get expelled?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, a quizzical look on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, this whole thing was your idea!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Hear, hear,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> enthusiastically.
“Hey, that’s an idea!” said <PER>Ron</PER> excitedly, but <PER>Hermione</PER> made a skeptical noise and all three of them looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, Sirius’s head turning in the flames.
“Well, I’m sure you’ll come up with somewhere There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you might have enough space to practice jinxes in there — ” “Fred and George told me it’s blocked,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Why did he — ?” <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a horrified gasp and leapt to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet, still staring at the fire.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> has been reading your mail, <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Watch your frog, it’s escaping.” <PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully toward the other side of the table — “Acciol ” — and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand.
Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s whispered discussion about how <PER>Umbridge</PER> had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.
“Silenciol” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hastily, pointing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at <PER>Harry</PER>’s frog, which deflated silently before them.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s not stupid, <PER>Harry</PER> knows she nearly got <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s the way you’re moving your wand,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, watching <PER>Ron</PER> critically.
“Fine, let’s swap,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, seizing <PER>Ron</PER>’s raven and replacing it with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own fat bullfrog.
“Very good, Miss Granger!” said Professor Flitwick’s squeaky little voice and <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> all jumped.
It came as no surprise to any of them that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were given additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework.
“To re-form the Quidditch team!” “Excellent.” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> together.
“I went to <PER>McGonagall</PER> and I think she might have appealed to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — anyway, <PER>Umbridge</PER> had to give in.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s smile slipped slightly as <PER>Ron</PER>’s looked out of the window, which was now opaque with hammering rain.
“Hope this clears up What’s up with you, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> too was gazing at the window, but not as though <PER>Hermione</PER> really saw it.
<PER>Hermione</PER> eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“It would’ve been really annoying if you hadn’t explained yourself properly.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at him as though <PER>Hermione</PER> had only just realized him was there.
“I was just wondering,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s voice stronger now, “whether we’re doing the right thing, starting this Defense Against the Dark Arts group.” “What!” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, it was your idea in the first place!” said <PER>Ron</PER> indignantly.
“I know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, twisting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s fingers together.
“Let’s get this straight,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily, as they put their bags back on the floor, “Sirius agrees with us, so you don’t think us should do it anymore?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked tense and rather miserable.
Now staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s own hands <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “Do you honestly trust his judgment?” “Yes, I do!” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once.
<PER>Hermione</PER> watched Katie leap to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before <PER>Hermione</PER> spoke again and it sounded as though <PER>Hermione</PER> was choosing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s words very carefully.
“Sirius is right,” he said, “you do sound just like my mother.” <PER>Hermione</PER> bit <PER>Hermione</PER>'s lip and did not answer.
The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven o’clock that evening, when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass.
<PER>Harry</PER> kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and shot upward, the wind pulling <PER>Harry</PER> slightly off course.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no idea how <PER>Harry</PER> was going to see the Snitch in this weather; <PER>Harry</PER> was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing; a minute into the practice it almost unseated <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid the Sloth Grip Roll.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear them complaining in low voices as <PER>Harry</PER> toweled <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair dry.
<PER>Harry</PER> emerged from behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s towel; the changing room was blurred because <PER>Harry</PER> was not wearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses; but <PER>Harry</PER> could still tell that everyone’s face was turned toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But ” Looking scared, <PER>Ron</PER> strode across to the window and stared out into the rain, “He — He can’t be near us now, can He?” “No,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, sinking onto a bench and rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
“Did you get a vision, or something?” <PER>Harry</PER> sat quite still, staring at <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, allowing <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind and <PER>Harry</PER>'s memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain A confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices “He wants something done, and it’s not happening fast enough,” He said.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and covered <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands, pressing down upon them with <PER>Harry</PER>'s palms.
He felt <PER>Ron</PER> sit down on the bench beside him and knew <PER>Ron</PER> was staring at him.
“What is it, then?” <PER>Harry</PER> was thinking then?” <PER>Harry</PER> back.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been looking into <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s face <PER>Harry</PER> scar had hurt and <PER>Harry</PER> had had that odd feeling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach a strange, leaping feeling a happy feeling But, of course, <PER>Harry</PER> had not recognized it for what it was, as <PER>Harry</PER> had been feeling so miserable <PER>Harry</PER> “Last time, it was because he was pleased,” he said.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re reading <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mind” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> is watching the owls and the fires, remember?” “Well then, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ” “I’ve just told you, he already knows,” said <PER>Harry</PER> shortly, getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, taking <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak off <PER>Harry</PER>'s peg, and swinging it around <PER>Harry</PER>.
“There’s no point telling him again.” <PER>Ron</PER> did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching <PER>Harry</PER> thoughtfully.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d want to know,” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d said.
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice and <PER>Harry</PER> came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> was rather grateful that she was not around because <PER>Harry</PER> did not much want to discuss <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar hurting and have shis urge <PER>Harry</PER> to go to <PER>Dumbledore</PER> too.
<PER>Ron</PER> kept throwing him anxious glances, but <PER>Harry</PER> pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s Potions book and set to work to finish <PER>Harry</PER>'s essay, though <PER>Harry</PER> was only pretending to concentrate and, by the time that <PER>Ron</PER> said he was going to bed too, had written hardly anything.
Midnight came and went while <PER>Harry</PER> was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, lovage, and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness <PER>Hermione</PER> said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in Grimmauld Place moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used the Daily Prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they found out that his knew what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was feeling therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts confusing was the word, all right; why did his know what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was feeling?
where the wizard is desirous how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would like to sleep of producing hot-headedness It was warm and comfortable in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s armchair before the fire, with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes and Crookshanks purring and the crackling of the flames The book slipped from <PER>Harry</PER>’s slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug.
“Er have you been taking all the clothes <PER>Hermione</PER>’s been leaving out?” “Oh no, sir,” said Dobby happily, “Dobby has been taking some for Winky too, sir.” “Yeah, how is Winky?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Harry</PER> Potter does not seem happy,” Dobby went on, straightening up again and looking timidly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’ve had worse.” The elf surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s vast, orblike eyes.
Then he said very seriously, his ears drooping, “Dobby wishes he could help <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, for <PER>Harry</PER> Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier now” <PER>Harry</PER> smiled.
“You can’t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer” <PER>Harry</PER> bent and picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s Potions book.
“It is a most amazing room, sir.” “How many people know about it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sitting up straighter in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
“We could go now, if you like!” For a moment <PER>Harry</PER> was tempted to go now; <PER>Harry</PER> was halfway out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s seat, intending to hurry upstairs for <PER>Harry</PER>'s Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like <PER>Hermione</PER>’s whispered in his ear: reckless.
“Not tonight, Dobby,” said <PER>Harry</PER> reluctantly, sinking back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair.
“Good,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, when she told <PER>Harry</PER>, “because we’ve found somewhere to have we first Defense meeting.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> told you about it?” “Just in passing,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shrugging.
“Oh well, that’s all right then,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> briskly and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised no more objections.
Somewhat to <PER>Harry</PER>’s disappointment, it was <PER>Ginny</PER> who managed to find <PER>Cho</PER> Chang and <PER>Ginny</PER>'s friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had turned up in the Hog’s Head.
At half-past seven <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the Gryffindor common room, <PER>Harry</PER> clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“Hold it,” said <PER>Harry</PER> warningly, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, and muttering, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” A map of Hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface of the parchment.
“Filch is on the second floor,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, holding the map close to <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes and scanning it closely, “and Mistress Norris is on the fourth.” “And <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously.
“Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in <PER>Harry</PER>'s relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch.
<PER>Ron</PER> had screwed up his eyes in concentration, <PER>Hermione</PER> was whispering something under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath, <PER>Harry</PER>’s fists were clenched as <PER>Harry</PER> stared ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>.
Just give We a place to practice somewhere they can’t find us “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply, as they wheeled around after their third walk past.
“A Compendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions The Dark Arts Outsmarted Self-Defensive Spellwork wow ” She looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, Shis face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced <PER>Hermione</PER> that what they were doing was right.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around; <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, Lavender, Parvati, and Dean had arrived.
“What is this place?” <PER>Harry</PER> began to explain, but before <PER>Harry</PER> had finished more people had arrived, and <PER>Harry</PER> had to start all over again.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> carefully marked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside.
“What, <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “I think we ought to elect a leader,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s leader,” said <PER>Cho</PER> at once, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though <PER>Cho</PER> were mad, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach did yet another back flip.
“I was thinking,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, frowning at Fred, “more of a name that didn’t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.” “The Defense Association?” said <PER>Cho</PER>.
“I don’t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help we against <PER>Voldemort</PER>, do you?” “I’ve used it against <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth slightly drier than usual with all those eyes upon him, “I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice.” It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed.
<PER>Harry</PER> was too quick for <PER>Neville</PER>, whose wand went spinning out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks, and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which <PER>Harry</PER> retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.
“Expelliarmusl” said <PER>Neville</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand.
“I’ve never done IT before — I DID IT!” “Good one!” said <PER>Harry</PER> encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel situation <PER>Neville</PER>’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held loosely at <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
“Listen, <PER>Neville</PER>, can you take it in turns to practice with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?” <PER>Harry</PER> moved off into the middle of the room.
“Sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said George hastily, when <PER>Harry</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was teamed with Michael Corner; <PER>Ginny</PER> was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx <PER>Ginny</PER>.
He avoided going near <PER>Cho</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER>'s friend for a while, but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt He could not ignore them any longer.
“Oh no,” said <PER>Cho</PER> rather wildly as <PER>Cho</PER> approached.
“ Expelliarmiousl I mean, Exnellimellius\ I — oh, sorry, Marietta!” Her curly-haired friend’s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extinguished it with <PER>Cho</PER>'s own wand and glared at <PER>Harry</PER> as though it was his fault.
“You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!” <PER>Cho</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> ruefully.
“That was quite good,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied, but when she raised shis eyebrows <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I was watching from over there” she laughed.
“Well, they’ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of <PER>Umbridge</PER> too,” said <PER>Cho</PER>, drawing <PER>Cho</PER> up proudly.
“Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> called from the other end of the room, “have you checked the time?” He looked down at He's watch and received a shock — it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out-of-bounds.
“That was really, really good, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, when finally it was just her, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> left.
“Did you see me disarm <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Only once,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, stung.
<PER>Harry</PER> had one eye on the Marauder’s Map, but <PER>Harry</PER> was also thinking of how <PER>Cho</PER> had said <PER>Cho</PER> made <PER>Cho</PER>'s nervous <PER>Harry</PER> felt as though <PER>Harry</PER> were carrying some kind of talisman inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest over the following two weeks, a glowing secret that supported <PER>Harry</PER> through <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s classes and even made it possible for <PER>Harry</PER> to smile blandly as <PER>Harry</PER> looked into her horrible bulging eyes.
were resisting her under her very nose, doing the very thing that her and the Ministry most feared, and whenever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard’s book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings, remembering how <PER>Neville</PER> had successfully disarmed <PER>Hermione</PER>, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after three meetings’ hard effort, how Parvati Patil had produced such a good Reductor Curse that Parvati Patil had reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to dust.
meetings, as they had to accommodate three separate Quidditch teams’ practices, which were often rearranged depending on the weather conditions; but <PER>Harry</PER> was not sorry about this, <PER>Harry</PER> had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable.
a fake Galleon (<PER>Ron</PER> became very excited when he saw the basket at first, convinced that <PER>Hermione</PER> was actually giving out gold).
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“That is where I got the idea but you’ll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members’ skin” “Yeah I prefer your way,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning, as <PER>Harry</PER> slipped <PER>Harry</PER>'s Galleon into <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized how much Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> cared about beating Slytherin when Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match.
Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and said grimly, “I’ve become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don’t want to have to hand it over to Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, so use the extra time to practice, won’t you?” Professor <PER>Snape</PER> was no less obviously partisan: Professor <PER>Snape</PER> had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s chances; they had, after all, never lost to <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s team.
Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> was still not performing to Wood’s standard, but Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Ron</PER> was working extremely hard to improve.
Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> made a blunder; if Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> let in one goal Admittedly <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Ron</PER> became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more.
On the other hand, <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Ron</PER> make some truly spectacular saves when <PER>Harry</PER> was on form: During one memorable practice, <PER>Harry</PER> had hung one- handed from <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end.
Even Fred had said that <PER>Ron</PER> might yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously considering admitting that he was related to they, something he assured <PER>Ron</PER> they had been trying to deny for four years.
The only thing really worrying <PER>Harry</PER> was how much <PER>Ron</PER> was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset <PER>Harry</PER> before they even got onto the pitch.
“Warrington’s aim’s so pathetic I’d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,” he retorted, which made <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson’s face.
When <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> imitated <PER>Ron</PER> dropping the Quaffle (which <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> did whenever they were within sight of each other), <PER>Ron</PER>’s ears glowed red and <PER>Ron</PER>’s's hands shook so badly that <PER>Ron</PER>’s was likely to drop whatever <PER>Ron</PER>’s was holding at the time too.
When <PER>Harry</PER> awoke <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed and saw <PER>Harry</PER> sitting bolt upright, <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms around <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, staring fixedly into space.
<PER>Harry</PER> was reminded forcibly of the time that <PER>Ron</PER> had accidentally put a slug- vomiting charm on <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked just as pale and sweaty as <PER>Harry</PER> had done then, not to mention as reluctant to open <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth.
<PER>Harry</PER> tried to see what was written on the badges as <PER>Harry</PER> walked by, but <PER>Harry</PER> was too concerned to get <PER>Ron</PER> past their table quickly to linger long enough to read their.
“Mental.” “Don’t be thick,” said <PER>Harry</PER> firmly, passing <PER>Harry</PER> a choice of cereals.
“Look at that save you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant — ” <PER>Ron</PER> turned a tortured face to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I didn’t mean to do it — I slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and I was trying to get back on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident.” “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise, “a few more accidents like that and the game’s in the bag, isn’t it?” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> sat down opposite them wearing red-and-gold scarves, gloves, and rosettes.
“How’re you feeling?” <PER>Ginny</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them.
“<PER>Ron</PER>’s just got to have some breakfast.” It became clear after ten minutes, however, that <PER>Ron</PER> was not capable of eating anything more and <PER>Harry</PER> thought it best to get <PER>Harry</PER> down to the changing rooms.
As they rose from the table, <PER>Hermione</PER> got up too, and taking <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm, <PER>Hermione</PER> drew <PER>Harry</PER> to one side.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked questioningly at she, but she shook shis head warningly; <PER>Ron</PER> had just ambled over to them, looking lost and desperate.
“Good luck, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek.
“And you, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER> seemed to come to <PER>Harry</PER> — ” <PER>Ron</PER> slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall.
He seemed too distracted to notice much around him, but <PER>Harry</PER> cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table, and this time He made out the words etched onto them: With an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, <PER>Harry</PER> hurried <PER>Ron</PER> across the entrance hall, down the stone steps, and out into the icy air.
<PER>Harry</PER> pointed out these encouraging factors to <PER>Ron</PER> as they walked, but <PER>Harry</PER> was not sure that <PER>Ron</PER> was listening.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> pulled on their robes (<PER>Ron</PER> attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took pity on him and went to help) and then sat down to listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch.
<PER>Harry</PER> was starting to feel nervous, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER>'s butterflies were as nothing to <PER>Ron</PER>’s, who was clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach and staring straight ahead again, <PER>Harry</PER>'s jaw set and <PER>Harry</PER>'s complexion pale gray.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> stood to one side, the sunlight gleaming on <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s white-blond head.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and smirked, tapping the crown-shaped badge on his chest.
The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upward; out of the corner of his eye <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Ron</PER> streak off toward the goal hoops.
eye <PER>Harry</PER> zoomed higher, dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide lap of the pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other side of the stadium, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was doing exactly the same.
“Just a fun fact, Professor, adds a bit of interest — and she’s ducked Warrington, she’s passed Montague, she’s — ouch — been hit from behind by a Bludger from Crabbe Montague catches the Quaffle, Montague heading back up the pitch and — nice Bludger there from George Weasley, that’s a Bludger to the head for Montague, Montague drops the Quaffle, caught by Katie Bell, Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet’s away — ” Lee Jordan’s commentary rang through the stadium and <PER>Harry</PER> listened as hard as <PER>Harry</PER> could through the wind whistling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears and the din of the crowd, all yelling and booing and singing — “ — dodges Warrington, avoids a Bludger — close call, Alicia — and the crowd are loving this, just listen to the crowd, what’s that they’re singing?” And as Lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands: George Weasley cannot save a thing, George Weasley cannot block a single ring, That’s why Slytherins all sing: George Weasley is our King.
“ — and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as <PER>Harry</PER> swerved, <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides boiling at what <PER>Harry</PER> had just heard, <PER>Harry</PER> knew Lee was trying to drown out the sound of the singing.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help <PER>Harry</PER>: Abandoning <PER>Harry</PER>'s search for the Snitch, <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt toward <PER>Ron</PER>, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch, hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted toward him “ — and it’s Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington heading for goal, he’s out of Bludger range with just the Keeper ahead — ” A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands below: Weasley cannot save a thing, He cannot block a single ring “ — so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, Weasley, brother of Beaters, Fred and George, and a promising new talent on the team — come on, <PER>Ron</PER>!” But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin end: <PER>Ron</PER> had dived wildly, his arms wide, and the Quaffle had soared between them, straight through <PER>Ron</PER>’s central hoop.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” screamed Angelina, soaring past <PER>Harry</PER> to keep up with Katie.
“GET <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER> had been stationary in midair for more than a minute, watching the progress of the match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the Snitch; horrified, <PER>Harry</PER> went into a dive and started circling the pitch again, staring around, trying to ignore the chorus now thundering through the stadium: There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere <PER>Harry</PER> looked; <PER>Malfoy</PER> was still circling the stadium just like <PER>Harry</PER>.
Looking down, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the pug-faced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her back to the pitch as her conducted the Slytherin supporters who were roaring: But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch, a few goals and they would be in the lead as usual, <PER>Harry</PER> assured <PER>Harry</PER>, bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be Montague’s watch strap But <PER>Ron</PER> let in two more goals.
<PER>Harry</PER> ducked a Bludger that Crabbe had sent rocketing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s direction and resumed <PER>Harry</PER>'s frantic scouring of the pitch for the Snitch, keeping one eye on <PER>Malfoy</PER> in case <PER>Harry</PER> showed signs of having spotted it, but <PER>Malfoy</PER>, like <PER>Harry</PER>, was continuing to soar around the stadium, searching fruitlessly “ — Pucey throws to Warrington, Warrington to Montague, Montague back to Pucey — Johnson intervenes, Johnson takes the Quaffle, Johnson to Bell, this looks good — I mean bad — Bell’s hit by a Bludger from Goyle of Slytherin and it’s Pucey in possession again ” But <PER>Harry</PER> had seen it at last: The tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was hovering feet from the ground at the Slytherin end of the pitch.
<PER>Harry</PER> dived In a matter of seconds, <PER>Malfoy</PER> was streaking out of the sky on <PER>Harry</PER>’s left, a green-and-silver blur lying flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom Golden Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops and scooted off toward the other side of the stands; its change of direction suited <PER>Malfoy</PER>, who was nearer.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt around, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER> were now neck and neck Feet from the ground, <PER>Harry</PER> lifted <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand from <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom, stretching toward broom Golden Snitch to broom Golden Snitch's right, <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s arm extended too, reaching, groping It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds — <PER>Harry</PER>’s fingers closed around the tiny, struggling ball — <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s fingernails scrabbled the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand hopelessly — <PER>Harry</PER> pulled — <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom upward, holding the struggling ball in — <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval They were saved, it did not matter that <PER>Ron</PER> had let in those goals, nobody would remember as long as Gryffindor had won — A Bludger hit <PER>Harry</PER> squarely in the small of the back and <PER>Harry</PER> flew forward off <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom; luckily <PER>Harry</PER> was only five or six feet above the ground, having dived so low to catch broom Golden Snitch, but <PER>Harry</PER> was winded all the same as <PER>Harry</PER> landed flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on the frozen pitch.
“He whacked the Bludger at you the moment He saw you’d got the Snitch — but we won, <PER>Harry</PER>, we won!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard a snort from behind <PER>Harry</PER> and turned around, still holding the Snitch tightly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand: <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had landed close by; white-faced with fury, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> was still managing to sneer.
“I’ve never seen a worse Keeper but then he was born in a bin Did you like my lyrics, Potter?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer; <PER>Harry</PER> turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one, yelling and punching the air in triumph, all except <PER>Ron</PER>, who had dismounted from <PER>Harry</PER>'s broom over by the goalposts and was making his way slowly back to the changing rooms alone.
“We wanted to write another couple of verses!” <PER>Malfoy</PER> called, as Katie and Alicia hugged <PER>Harry</PER>.
Halfway through shaking <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand they stiffened, looking around at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around for Madam Hooch, but she was still berating Crabbe for <PER>Harry</PER>'s illegal Bludger attack.
“Or perhaps,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, leering as <PER>Harry</PER> backed away, “you can remember what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it — ” <PER>Harry</PER> was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting at <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
With no time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s stomach — “<PER>Harry</PER>!
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s nose bloody; George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the background.
<PER>Harry</PER> became aware that something was still struggling in <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand, the knuckles of which he had bruised against <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s jaw; looking down he saw the Snitch’s silver wings protruding from between his fingers, struggling for release.
“Provoked you?” shouted Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, slamming a fist onto Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s desk so that her tartan biscuit tin slid sideways off her tartan biscuit tin and burst open, littering the floor with Ginger Newts.
“And <PER>Harry</PER>’s mother.” “But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling, did you?” bellowed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER> was standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s resemblance to a giant toad, and smiling in the horribly sickly, ominous way that <PER>Harry</PER> had come to associate with imminent misery.
“May I help, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>?” asked Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> in Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s most poisonously sweet voice.
“Why, I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority.” <PER>Harry</PER> would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s nostrils.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt the Snitch fluttering madly in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
Everywhere <PER>Harry</PER> looked there were disconsolate and angry faces; the team themselves were slumped around the fire, all apart from <PER>Ron</PER>, who had not been seen since the end of the match.
Only <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were left beside the fire.
“Have you seen <PER>Ron</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked in a low voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
When He saw <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> He stopped dead in He's tracks.
“Come and sit down!” <PER>Ron</PER> walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from <PER>Harry</PER>’s, not looking at him.
“I’m going to resign first thing tomorrow.” “If you resign,” said <PER>Harry</PER> testily, “there’ll only be three players left on the team.” And when <PER>Ron</PER> looked puzzled, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “I’ve been given a lifetime ban.
<PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> the full story; <PER>Harry</PER> could not bear to tell it again.
When <PER>Hermione</PER> had finished, <PER>Ron</PER> looked more anguished than ever.
“This is all my fault — ” “You didn’t make me punch <PER>Malfoy</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, turning away from the pitch- black, snow-flecked window, a broad smile spreading across <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s back.” <PER>Harry</PER> sprinted up to the boys’ dormitory to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map from <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk; <PER>Harry</PER> was so quick that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were ready to leave at least five minutes before <PER>Hermione</PER> hurried back down from the girls’ dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats.
With a great leap of his heart, <PER>Harry</PER> saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s chimney.
<PER>Harry</PER> set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door; when <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, it’s us!” <PER>Harry</PER> called through the keyhole.
“I just — oh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>).” “It’s nuthin’, it’s nuthin’!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to gaze up at him in horror.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hair was matted with congealed blood, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple-and-black bruises.
“Blimey, it’s good ter see you three again — had good summers, did yeh?” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, you’ve been attacked!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously.
“You’re not going to eat that, are you, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, leaning in for a closer look.
“So you have been to look for giants?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, grinning as <PER>Harry</PER> sat down at the table.
“Come on, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, tell us what you’ve been up to!” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Tell us about being attacked by the giants and <PER>Harry</PER> can tell you about being attacked by the dementors — ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea, and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as <PER>Hagrid</PER> coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft splat, onto the floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Oh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>, don’t, it’s not hygien — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> began, but <PER>Hagrid</PER> had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye.
“You knew where the giants were?” “Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew, an’ he told us,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“But — why couldn’t you just grab a Portkey or something?” There was an odd expression in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s unobscured eye as he squinted at <PER>Ron</PER>; it was almost pitying.
“The Ministry’s keepin’ an eye on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> an’ anyone they reckon’s in league with him, an’ — ” “We know about that,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, keen to hear the rest of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s story.
“We know about the Ministry watching <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — ” “So you couldn’t use magic to get there?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, looking thunderstruck.
“You just walked right into a giant camp?” “Well, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d told us how ter do it,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“It was def’nitely on some of their minds,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, shrugging, “but we did what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told we ter do, which was ter hold we gift up high an’ keep we eyes on the Gurg an’ ignore the others.
“A branch of — ?” “Everlasting fire,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> irritably, “you ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick’s mentioned it at least twice in class!” “Well anyway,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> quickly, intervening before <PER>Ron</PER> could answer back, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’d bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn’ somethin’ any wizard could do, an’ so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus’s feet and says, ‘A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who sends his respectful greetings.’ ” “And what did Karkus say?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> eagerly.
“Didn’ speak English.” “You’re kidding!” “Didn’ matter,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> imperturbably, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had warned us tha’ migh’ happen.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wanted us ter take it very slow,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> allowed him thirty seconds’ reminiscence before clearing <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat loudly.
“Well that’s not bad — are they going to come over here and start fighting <PER>Voldemort</PER> with us?” But <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “What do you mean ‘at one point,’ <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> looked at her sadly.
“Nope,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak again and applied the cooler side to his face, “but we did wha’ we meant ter do, we gave ’em <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s message an’ some o’ them heard it an’ I ’spect some o’ them’ll remember it.
<PER>Harry</PER> became aware that the knees of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with Fang's head in <PER>Harry</PER>’s lap.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly after a while.
“Mmm?” “Did you was there any sign of did you hear anything about your your mother while you were there?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s unobscured eye rested upon her, and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather scared.
<PER>Hermione</PER> glanced nervously at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>, plainly wanting them to speak.
“But you still haven’t explained how you got in this state, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” <PER>Ron</PER> said, gesturing toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s bloodstained face.
“Get under here!” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak <PER>Harry</PER> whirled the Invisibility Cloak over <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> while <PER>Ron</PER> tore around the table and dived beneath the cloak as well.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, hide our mugs!” <PER>Hagrid</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s and <PER>Ron</PER>’s mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang’s basket.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was standing in the doorway wearing Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps.
“Er — I don’ want ter be rude,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, staring at she, “but who the ruddy hell are you?” “My name is Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>.” she eyes were sweeping the cabin.
Twice they stared directly into the corner where <PER>Harry</PER> stood, sandwiched between <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, sounding thoroughly confused.
“I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher — ” “Tha’s brave of yeh,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “there’s not many’d take tha’ job anymore — ” “ — and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, giving no sign that she had heard him.
“Precisely what I was going to ask,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been <PER>Hermione</PER>’s mug.
“Oh,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood hidden, “oh, tha’ was was Fang.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> stood facing him now, taking in every detail of <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s appearance instead of the cabin’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gasped; <PER>Harry</PER> clapped a hand over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth.
She passed within two inches of where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood pressed against the wall; <PER>Harry</PER> actually pulled in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach as she walked by.
<PER>Harry</PER> could almost hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain working furiously.
“I see.” “Yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, “bit o’ — o’ fresh air, yeh know — “Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> sweetly.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that two of <PER>Harry</PER>'s teeth had been knocked out.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> looked at <PER>Harry</PER> coldly; <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s smile faltered.
Then <PER>Umbridge</PER> hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s arm and said, “I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.” “Righ’,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, nodding.
“Oh yes,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> softly, looking back at him with <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s hand on the door handle.
<PER>Harry</PER> made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but <PER>Hermione</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>'s wrist.
“she might not be gone yet.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> seemed to be thinking the same way; yet.” <PER>Hagrid</PER> stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so.
“Trelawney’s on probation already” “Um what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I don’ want ter spoil the surprise.” “Look, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> urgently, dropping all pretense, “Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> won’t be at all happy if you bring anything to class that’s too dangerous — ” “Dangerous?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking genially bemused.
“But tha’s not very interestin’, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“The stuff I’ve got’s much more impressive, I’ve bin bringin’ ’em on fer years, I reckon I’ve got the on’y domestic herd in Britain — ” “<PER>Hagrid</PER> please ” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, a note of real desperation in her voice.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers <PER>Umbridge</PER> thinks are too close to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Lis’en, it’s bin a long day an’ it’s late,” he said, patting <PER>Hermione</PER> gently on the shoulder, so that <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud.
“Oh — sorry — ” He pulled <PER>Hermione</PER>'s back up by the neck of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes.
“Look, don’ you go worryin’ abou’ me, I promise yeh I’ve got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I’m back Now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an’ don’ forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!” “I dunno if you got through to him,” said <PER>Ron</PER> a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind they due to the Obliteration Charm <PER>Hermione</PER> was performing as they went.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> wanted to go with her, but <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>'s mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again, so <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> grudgingly remained in the common room, trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying students skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing, and worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.
“Gits ” <PER>Hermione</PER> returned from <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s just before lunch, shivering slightly, Gits ” <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes damp to the knees.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly- Plank’s lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small, unbiased part of <PER>Harry</PER> knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Plank’s idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off.
It was with a certain amount of apprehension that <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> headed down to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold.
<PER>Harry</PER> was worried, not only about what <PER>Hagrid</PER> might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the class, particularly <PER>Malfoy</PER> and his cronies, would behave if <PER>Umbridge</PER> was watching them.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not understand this: Had <PER>Hagrid</PER> perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing?
As though to complete the ominous picture, Had <PER>Hagrid</PER> was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over Had <PER>Hagrid</PER>'s shoulder.
“What did he say prefers the dark — did you hear?” <PER>Harry</PER> remembered the only occasion on which <PER>Malfoy</PER> had entered the forest before now; <PER>Harry</PER> had not been very brave then either.
<PER>Harry</PER> smiled to <PER>Harry</PER>; after the Quidditch match anything that caused <PER>Malfoy</PER> discomfort was all right with He.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after <PER>Hagrid</PER>, leading the rest of the class.
And then, as <PER>Hagrid</PER> shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest, <PER>Harry</PER> nudged <PER>Ron</PER> and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.
he looked eagerly at <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Ron</PER> was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, “Why doesn’t <PER>Hagrid</PER> call again?” Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as <PER>Ron</PER>’s and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them.
“Now put yer hands up, who can see ’em?” Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses, <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand.
“What’s eating it?” “Thestrals,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> proudly and <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a soft “oh!” of comprehension at <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“Righ’, now, who can tell me why some o’ you can see them an’ some can’t?” <PER>Hermione</PER> raised <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>, who had never heard <PER>Umbridge</PER> ’s fake cough before, was gazing in some concern at the closest thestral, evidently under the impression that it had made the sound.
“You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, in the same loud, slow voice <PER>Umbridge</PER> had used with <PER>Umbridge</PER> earlier, as though <PER>Umbridge</PER> was addressing somebody both foreign and very slow.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on shis clipboard, “ ‘has to resort to crude sign language ” “Well anyway ” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered.
<PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked as though Christmas had come a month early; <PER>Hermione</PER>, on the other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage.
“Oh yeah,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, throwing an uneasy glance at <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s clipboard, but plowing on valiantly.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had tears of fury in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes now.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> smiled indulgently at them and then turned to <PER>Neville</PER>.
“Erm,” said <PER>Neville</PER> nervously, with a glance at <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“No!” said <PER>Neville</PER>, looking upset, “no, I’m not scared of them — !” “It’s quite all right,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, patting <PER>Neville</PER> on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile, though it looked more like a leer to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” she turned to look up at him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice, “I think I’ve got enough to be getting along with You will receive” — she mimed taking something from the air in front of shis — “the results of your inspection” — she pointed at the clipboard — “in ten days’ time.” she held up ten stubby little fingers, then, shis smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath shis green hat, she bustled from their midst, leaving <PER>Malfoy</PER> and Pansy Parkinson in fits of laughter, <PER>Hermione</PER> actually shaking with fury, and <PER>Neville</PER> looking confused and upset.
“Well, it’s like <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, they can look after themselves,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> impatiently, “and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn’t usually show them to us before N.E.W.T.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER> — I’m sorry — no, of course I don’t — that was a really stupid thing to say — ” “It’s okay,” he said quickly, “don’t worry” “I’m surprised so many people could see them,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Ignore them, just ignore them,” intoned <PER>Hermione</PER>, pulling out <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that <PER>Hermione</PER> could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas approached.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s prefect duties were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle (“You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with Peeves,” said <PER>Ron</PER>), to watch over first and second years spending their break times inside because of the bitter cold (“And they’re cheeky little snotrags, you know, we definitely weren’t that rude when we were in first year,” said <PER>Ron</PER>), and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels (“He’s got dung for brains, that one,” said <PER>Ron</PER> furiously).
They were so busy that <PER>Hermione</PER> had stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that <PER>Hermione</PER> was down to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s last three.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was going skiing with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s parents, something that greatly amused <PER>Ron</PER>, who had never before heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down mountains.
<PER>Harry</PER> endured several days of jealousy before <PER>Ron</PER> said, in response to <PER>Harry</PER> asking how <PER>Ron</PER> was going to get home for Christmas, “But you’re coming too!
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether <PER>Harry</PER> could possibly persuade Molly to invite <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather for the festivities too, but apart from the fact that <PER>Harry</PER> doubted whether <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place, <PER>Harry</PER> could not help but feel that Mistress Weasley might not want Mistress Weasley; they were so often at loggerheads.
Sirius had not contacted <PER>Harry</PER> at all since <PER>Harry</PER>'s last appearance in the fire, and although <PER>Harry</PER> knew that with <PER>Umbridge</PER> on the constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> did not like to think of Sirius alone in <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother’s old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.
meeting before the holidays and was very glad <PER>Harry</PER> had, because when the lamps burst into light <PER>Harry</PER> saw that Dobby had taken it upon <PER>Harry</PER> to decorate the place for Christmas.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell the elf had done it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and bearing the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!
“These are nice, did you put These up?” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “it was Dobby the house-elf.” “Mistletoe,” said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Cho</PER> laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had missed a step going downstairs.
“Well start with the Impediment Jinx, just for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again.” They all divided up obediently; <PER>Harry</PER> partnered <PER>Neville</PER> as usual.
After a while, when <PER>Harry</PER> had unfrozen three times in a row, <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Neville</PER> join <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> again so that <PER>Harry</PER> could walk around the room and watch the others.
When <PER>Harry</PER> passed <PER>Cho</PER> she beamed at <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> resisted the temptation to walk past shis several more times.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> positively swelling with pride as <PER>Harry</PER> watched them all.
Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> and stacked them neatly away.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left before he did; he hung back a little, because <PER>Cho</PER> was still there and <PER>Cho</PER> was hoping to receive a Merry Christmas from <PER>Cho</PER>.
Adam’s turned and saw <PER>Cho</PER> standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down <PER>Cho</PER>'s face.
“Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER> wearily, moving toward the door, “I dunno why, nor does anyone else, so it’s nothing to be proud of.” “Oh don’t go!” said <PER>Cho</PER>, sounding tearful again.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a burning desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inability to move <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“Mistletoe,” said <PER>Cho</PER> quietly, pointing at the ceiling over <PER>Cho</PER>'s head.
“I really like you, <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> could not think.
A tingling sensation was spreading throughout <PER>Harry</PER>, paralyzing <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms, legs, and brain.
He could see every tear clinging to Shis eyelashes He returned to the common room half an hour later to find <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> in the best seats by the fire; nearly everybody else had gone to bed.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was writing a very long letter; <PER>Hermione</PER> had already filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the edge of the table.
Half of <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> what had just happened, but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked, peering at <PER>Harry</PER> over the tip of her quill.
In truth, <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t know whether <PER>Harry</PER> was all right or not.
“What’s up?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What’s happened?” <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t quite know how to set about telling them, and still wasn’t sure whether <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to.
Just as <PER>Harry</PER> had decided not to say anything, <PER>Hermione</PER> took matters out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
“Is it <PER>Cho</PER>?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked in a businesslike way.
“Did <PER>Hermione</PER> corner you after the meeting?” Numbly surprised, <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
<PER>Ron</PER> sniggered, breaking off when <PER>Hermione</PER> caught his eye.
“she — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began, rather hoarsely; <PER>Harry</PER> cleared <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat and tried again.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked from <PER>Ron</PER>’s expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to <PER>Hermione</PER>’s slight frown, and nodded.
A reluctant grin spread over <PER>Harry</PER>’s face as <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Ron</PER> rolling around on the hearthrug.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gave <PER>Ron</PER> a look of deep disgust and returned to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s letter.
“Well?” <PER>Ron</PER> said finally, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Maybe I am.” “Of course you’re not,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> absently, still scribbling away at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s letter.
“Because <PER>Cho</PER> spends half <PER>Cho</PER>'s time crying these days,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the place.” “You’d think a bit of kissing would cheer <PER>Cho</PER>'s up,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, grinning.
“<PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her quill into her ink pot, “you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” said <PER>Ron</PER> indignantly.
“What sort of person cries while someone’s kissing them?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, slightly desperately, “who does?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
“Don’t you understand how <PER>Cho</PER>’s feeling at the moment?” <PER>Cho</PER> asked.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
<PER>Hermione</PER> sighed and laid down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s quill.
“You were, weren’t you?” “Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, an unpleasant heat creeping up <PER>Harry</PER>'s face, “I sort of — patted her on the back a bit.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked as though <PER>Hermione</PER> was restraining <PER>Hermione</PER> from rolling <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes with extreme difficulty.
“Oh well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> distantly, buried in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s letter once more, “you’ll have plenty of opportunities to ask <PER>Hermione</PER>” “What if he doesn’t want to ask <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had been watching <PER>Harry</PER> with an unusually shrewd expression on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Don’t be silly,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> vaguely, “<PER>Harry</PER>’s liked <PER>Hermione</PER>'s for ages, haven’t you, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>?
Yes, <PER>Harry</PER> had liked <PER>Cho</PER> for ages, but whenever <PER>Harry</PER> had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a <PER>Cho</PER> who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a <PER>Cho</PER> who was sobbing uncontrollably into <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
“Who ’re you writing the novel to anyway?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor.
They sat in silence for another twenty minutes, <PER>Ron</PER> finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, <PER>Hermione</PER> writing steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and sealing it, and <PER>Harry</PER> staring into the fire, wishing more than anything that Sirius’s head would appear there and give <PER>Harry</PER> some advice about girls.
“Well, ’night,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, yawning widely, and <PER>Hermione</PER> set off up the girls’ staircase.
“What does <PER>Hermione</PER> see in Krum?” <PER>Ron</PER> demanded as he and <PER>Harry</PER> climbed the boys’ stairs.
“Well,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, considering the matter, “I s’pose he’s older, isn’t he and he’s an international Quidditch player” “Yeah, but apart from that,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding aggravated.
“I mean he’s a grouchy git, isn’t he?” “Bit grouchy, yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, whose thoughts were still on <PER>Cho</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses on <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster; instead <PER>Harry</PER> stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to <PER>Neville</PER>’s bed.
If he had known, this time last night, that in twenty-four hours’ time he would have kissed <PER>Cho</PER> Chang “ ’Night,” grunted <PER>Ron</PER>, from somewhere to his right.
<PER>Harry</PER> dreamed <PER>Harry</PER> was back in the D.A.
<PER>Cho</PER> was accusing <PER>Cho</PER> of luring <PER>Cho</PER>'s there under false pretenses; <PER>Cho</PER> said that <PER>Cho</PER> had promised <PER>Cho</PER>'s a hundred and fifty <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog cards if <PER>Cho</PER> showed up.
<PER>Harry</PER> protested <PER>Cho</PER> shouted, “ Cedric gave me loads of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog cards, look\” And she pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside her robes and threw them into the air, and then turned into <PER>Hermione</PER>, who said, “You did promise she, you know, <PER>Harry</PER> I think you’d better give shis something else instead How about your Firebolt?” And <PER>Harry</PER> was protesting that <PER>Harry</PER> could not give <PER>Cho</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s Firebolt because <PER>Umbridge</PER> had it, and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous, he’d only come to the D.A.
he was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone he was flat against the floor, sliding along on his belly It was dark, yet he could see objects around he shimmering in strange, vibrant colors he was turning his head At first glance, the corridor was empty but no a man was sitting on the floor ahead, a man's chin drooping onto a man's chest, his outline gleaming in the dark <PER>Harry</PER> put out <PER>Harry</PER>'s tongue <PER>Harry</PER> tasted the man’s scent on the air <PER>Harry</PER> was alive but drowsing sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor <PER>Harry</PER> longed to bite a man but <PER>Harry</PER> must master the impulse <PER>Harry</PER> had more important work to do But a man was stirring a silvery cloak fell from a man's legs as a man jumped to a man's feet; and <PER>Harry</PER> saw a man's vibrant, blurred outline towering above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt him had no choice him reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging him's fangs deeply into a man’s flesh, feeling him's ribs splinter beneath him's jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood a man was yelling in pain then a man fell silent a man slumped backward against the wall Blood was splattering onto the floor a man forehead hurt terribly It was aching fit to burst “<PER>Harry</PER>!
“<PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Ron</PER> was standing over <PER>Harry</PER>l” <PER>Ron</PER> looking extremely frightened.
<PER>Harry</PER> clutched <PER>Harry</PER>'s head in his hands; the pain was blinding him <PER>Harry</PER> rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly, “you you were just dreaming” “No!” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously; it was crucial that <PER>Ron</PER> understand.
“<PER>Neville</PER>’s gone for help” “I’m fine!” <PER>Harry</PER> choked, wiping <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pajamas and shaking uncontrollably.
Whether one minute passed or ten, <PER>Harry</PER> did not know; <PER>Harry</PER> simply sat there shaking, feeling the pain recede very slowly from <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar Then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Neville</PER>’s voice again.
“Over here, Professor ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> came hurrying into the dormitory in Professor ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s tartan dressing gown, Professor ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose.
“I’m not lying, and I’m not mad!” <PER>Harry</PER> told her, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice rising to a shout.
“Put on your dressing-gown — we’re going to see the headmaster.” <PER>Harry</PER> was so relieved that she was taking <PER>Harry</PER> seriously that <PER>Harry</PER> did not hesitate, but jumped out of bed at once, pulled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s dressing gown, and pushed <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses back onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose.
They followed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> past the silent figures of <PER>Neville</PER>, Dean, and Seamus, out of the dormitory, down the spiral stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole, and off along the Fat Lady’s moonlit corridor.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though the panic inside <PER>Harry</PER> might spill over at any moment; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to run, to yell for <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
They passed Mistress Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly, but Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> said, “Shoo!” Mistress Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few minutes They had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
The door opened of its own accord and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> led <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> inside.
“Oh, it’s you, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and ah.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sitting in a high-backed chair behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple-and-gold dressing gown over a snowy-white nightshirt, but seemed wide awake, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s penetrating light-blue eyes fixed intently upon Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>, Potter has had a well, a nightmare,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>, frowning slightly.
“Very well, then, Potter, you tell the headmaster about it.” ~ “I well, I was asleep” said <PER>Harry</PER> and even in <PER>Harry</PER>'s terror and <PER>Harry</PER>'s desperation to make <PER>Dumbledore</PER> understand <PER>Dumbledore</PER> felt slightly irritated that the headmaster was not looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, but examining <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own interlocked fingers.
“But it wasn’t an ordinary dream it was real I saw it happen” He took a deep breath, “<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad — Arthur — has been attacked by a giant snake.” The words seemed to reverberate in the air after <PER>Ron</PER>’s dad — Arthur — had said them, slightly ridiculous, even comic.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, white-faced and shocked.
“How did you see this?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked quietly, still not looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I saw it all from the snake’s point of view” Nobody else spoke for a moment, then <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, now looking at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was still whey-faced, said in a new and sharper voice, “Is Arthur seriously injured?” “ Yes” said <PER>Harry</PER> emphatically — why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side?
And why could <PER>Dumbledore</PER> not do <PER>Dumbledore</PER> the courtesy of looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?
But <PER>Dumbledore</PER> stood up so quickly that <PER>Harry</PER> jumped, and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at <PER>Harry</PER> under their eyelids, and <PER>Harry</PER> suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked.
“Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts ’s most celebrated Heads,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, now sweeping around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door.
“Please sit down, all three of you,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, as though <PER>Harry</PER> had not spoken.
“Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, if you could draw up extra chairs ” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> pulled Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had conjured back at <PER>Harry</PER>’s hearing.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down, watching <PER>Dumbledore</PER> over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> over <PER>Harry</PER> was now stroking Fawkes’s plumed golden head with one finger.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function <PER>Harry</PER> had never known, carried it over to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk, sat down facing them again, and tapped it gently with the tip of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> watched the smoke closely, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s brow furrowed, and after a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air A serpent’s head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether the instrument was confirming <PER>Harry</PER>'s story: <PER>Harry</PER> looked eagerly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a sign that <PER>Harry</PER> was right, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not look up.
“Naturally, naturally,” murmured <PER>Dumbledore</PER> apparently to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise.
With a look of grim satisfaction <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gave the instrument another gentle tap with <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand: The clinking noise slowed and died, and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze, and vanished.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table; <PER>Harry</PER> saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow <PER>Harry</PER> with the old headmasters in the portraits's eyes, then, realizing that <PER>Harry</PER> was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “What news?” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> at once.
“Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.” “Of course” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> got up and moved swiftly to the door; <PER>Harry</PER> cast a sideways glance at <PER>Ron</PER>, who was now looking terrified.
“And <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — what about Molly?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, pausing at the door.
“But she may already know that excellent clock of hers ” <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was referring to the clock that told, not the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family members, and with a pang he thought that Arthur’s hand must, even now, be pointing at “mortal peril.” But it was very late Molly was probably asleep, not watching the clock And he felt cold as he remembered Molly’s boggart turning into Mister Weasley’s lifeless body, his glasses askew, blood running down his face But Arthur wasn’t going to die Arthur couldn’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was now rummaging in a cupboard behind <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> marched over to another portrait, this time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s voice when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> attempted to rouse him.
“Oh no, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, I am too tired tonight” Something about Phineas ’s voice was familiar to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Dereliction of duty!” “We are honor-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts!” cried a frail-looking old wizard whom <PER>Harry</PER> recognized as <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s predecessor, Armando Dippet.
“Oh, very well,” said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod slightly apprehensively, “though he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he’s done most of the family — ” “Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> realized immediately where <PER>Harry</PER> had heard Phineas ’s voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom in Grimmauld Place.
“You are to give <PER>Harry</PER> the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that Arthur Weasley's wife, children, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter will be arriving at <PER>Harry</PER> Potter's house shortly.
Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> were ushered inside by Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, all three of them looking disheveled and shocked, still in them's night things.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — what’s going on?” asked <PER>Ginny</PER>, who looked frightened.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> says you saw Dad hurt — ” “Your father has been injured in the course of Your father's work for the Order of the Phoenix,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> before <PER>Harry</PER> could speak.
“My great-great-grandson has always had odd taste in houseguests” “Come here, then,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said to <PER>Harry</PER> and the Weasleys.
“And quickly, before anyone else joins us <PER>Harry</PER> and the others gathered around <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk.
At once, <PER>Harry</PER>’s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again — and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within <PER>Harry</PER> a hatred so powerful <PER>Harry</PER> felt, for that instant, that <PER>Harry</PER> would like nothing better than to strike — to bite — to sink <PER>Harry</PER>'s fangs into the man before him — “ three.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a powerful jerk behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s navel, the ground vanished from beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand was glued to the kettle; <PER>Harry</PER> was banging into the others as all sped forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling them onward and then — <PER>Harry</PER> feet hit the ground so hard that <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said, “Back again, the blood traitor brats, is it true the blood traitor brats's father’s dying “OUT!” roared a second voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and looked around; they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
“It was — ” <PER>Harry</PER> began; this was even worse than telling <PER>McGonagall</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I had a — a kind of — vision” And <PER>Harry</PER> told them all that <PER>Harry</PER> had seen, though <PER>Harry</PER> altered the story so that it sounded as though <PER>Harry</PER> had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake’s own eyes <PER>Ron</PER>, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not speak.
When <PER>Harry</PER> had finished, Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER> continued to stare at <PER>Harry</PER> for a moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know whether <PER>Harry</PER> was imagining it or not, but <PER>Harry</PER> fancied there was something accusatory in their looks.
Well, if they were going to blame <PER>Harry</PER> for just seeing the attack, <PER>Harry</PER> was glad <PER>Harry</PER> had not told them that <PER>Harry</PER> had been inside the snake at the time “Is Mum here?” said Fred, turning to Sirius.
<PER>Ginny</PER> said, “Somebody else could have told us us could have heard it somewhere other than <PER>Harry</PER>” “Like who?” said Sirius impatiently.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ron</PER>, who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug, and they sat down too.
<PER>Harry</PER> was only drinking to have something to do with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands.
I felt like I wanted to attack <PER>Dumbledore</PER> too <PER>Dumbledore</PER> put the bottle down on the table a little harder than <PER>Dumbledore</PER> meant to, so that the bottle slopped over onto the table.
If <PER>Harry</PER> had ever sat through a longer night than this one <PER>Harry</PER> could not remember it.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open; <PER>Harry</PER> could see them reflecting the firelight.
Mistress Weasley was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at Mistress Weasley, Fred, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> half-rising from their chairs, Mistress Weasley gave a wan smile.
George and <PER>Ginny</PER> got up, walked swiftly over to George and <PER>Ginny</PER>'s mother, and hugged her.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to intrude upon the Weasleys’ happiness, and <PER>Harry</PER> dreaded the moment when Molly would ask <PER>Harry</PER> to recount <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision.
However, <PER>Harry</PER> had barely taken plates from the dresser when Molly lifted them out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into a hug.
Without preamble <PER>Harry</PER> told preamble <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather every detail of the vision preamble <PER>Harry</PER> had had, including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Mister Weasley.
When he paused for breath, Sirius said, “Did you tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> this?” “Yes,” said preamble <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, “but preamble <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t tell me what it meant.
“Sirius, I I think I’m going mad Back in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office, just before we took the Portkey for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one — my scar really hurt when I was looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — Sirius, I wanted to attack him — ” him could only see a sliver of “Sirius’s face; the rest was in darkness.
“You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and — ” “It wasn’t that,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> went up to the bedroom <PER>Harry</PER> had shared with <PER>Ron</PER> over the summer, but while <PER>Ron</PER> crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, <PER>Harry</PER> sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping <PER>Harry</PER> deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that <PER>Harry</PER> might become the serpent again in <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleep and awake to find that <PER>Harry</PER> had attacked <PER>Ron</PER>, or else slithered through the house after one of the others When <PER>Ron</PER> woke up, <PER>Harry</PER> pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> sensed the concealed eye staring hard at <PER>Harry</PER>; trying to deflect more questions about <PER>Harry</PER>'s dream <PER>Harry</PER> asked Mad-Eye where St. Mungo’s was hidden.
He pushed <PER>Harry</PER> a little ahead of <PER>Harry</PER> and stumped along just behind; <PER>Harry</PER> knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat.
“Everybody ready?” They nodded, clustering around her; Moody gave <PER>Harry</PER> another shove between the shoulder blades to urge <PER>Harry</PER> forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy and said, her breath steaming up the glass, “Wotcher We’re here to see Arthur Weasley.” For a split second, <PER>Harry</PER> thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the very ugly dummy to hear her talking that quietly through a sheet of glass, when there were buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER> that dummies could not hear anyway.
Fred, George, and <PER>Ron</PER> stepped after them; <PER>Harry</PER> glanced around at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd.’s, nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them.
<PER>Harry</PER> drew back too, but Molly reached out a hand and pushed <PER>Harry</PER> through the door, saying, “Don’t be silly, <PER>Harry</PER>, Arthur wants to thank you” The ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pleased and relieved to see that <PER>Harry</PER> was propped up on several pillows and reading the Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around as they walked toward <PER>Harry</PER> and, seeing whom it was, beamed.
“ — got — er — me,” “Arthur said hastily, though <PER>Harry</PER> was quite sure that was not what <PER>Harry</PER> had meant to say.
For a few seconds <PER>Harry</PER> could hear nothing, then <PER>Harry</PER> heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside <PER>Harry</PER>. "
“You know, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seems almost to have been waiting for <PER>Harry</PER> to see something like this” “Yeah, well,” said Moody, “there’s something funny about the Potter kid, we all know that.” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed worried about <PER>Harry</PER> when I spoke to <PER>Harry</PER> this morning,” whispered Molly.
“The boy’s seeing things from inside You-Know- Who’s snake Obviously, Potter doesn’t realize what that means, but if You- Know- Who’s possessing him — ” <PER>Harry</PER> pulled the Extendable Ear out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
Was this why <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would no longer meet <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes?
Did <PER>Dumbledore</PER> expect to see <PER>Voldemort</PER> staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that them's vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils?
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered how the snakelike face of <PER>Voldemort</PER> had once forced itself out of the back of Professor <PER>Quirrell</PER>’s head, and <PER>Harry</PER> ran his hand over the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own, wondering what it would feel like if <PER>Voldemort</PER> burst out of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s skull <PER>Voldemort</PER> felt dirty, contaminated, as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not merely seen the snake, <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been the snake, <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew it now And then a truly terrible thought occurred to <PER>Voldemort</PER>, a memory bobbing to the surface of <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s mind, one that made <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s insides writhe and squirm like serpents “What’s he after apart from followers?” “Stuff he can only get by stealth like a weapon.
I’m the one <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s trying to use, that’s why they’ve got guards around me everywhere I go, it’s not for my protection, it’s for other people’s, only it’s not working, they can’t have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts I did attack Arthur last night, it was me, <PER>Voldemort</PER> made me do it and <PER>Voldemort</PER> could be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now “Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>, dear?” whispered Mistress Weasley, leaning across <PER>Ginny</PER> to speak to <PER>Harry</PER> as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel.
Perhaps he was an Animagus No, he couldn’t be, he would know perhaps <PER>Voldemort</PER> was an Animagus Yes, thought <PER>Harry</PER>, that would fit, <PER>Harry</PER> would turn into a snake of course and when <PER>Harry</PER>’s possessing me, then we both transform That still doesn’t explain how come I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes, though But then <PER>Voldemort</PER>’ s about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, it’s probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that And then, with a terrible stab of panic he thought, but this is insane — if <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s possessing me, I’m giving <PER>Voldemort</PER> a clear view into the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now!
Phineas Nigellus had appeared upon the canvas of Phineas Nigellus's portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching <PER>Harry</PER> with an amused expression on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Not running away, no,” said <PER>Harry</PER> shortly, dragging <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk a few more feet across the room.
“This is no cowardly flight — you are being noble.” <PER>Harry</PER> ignored <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, “I have a message for you from Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> spun around.
“What is it?” “Stay where you are.” “I haven’t moved!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand still upon the doorknob.
<PER>Harry</PER> was exhausted, <PER>Harry</PER> was confused beyond measure, <PER>Harry</PER> had experienced terror, relief, and then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still <PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not want to talk to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!
Fuming, <PER>Harry</PER> dragged <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk back to the foot of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed, then threw <PER>Harry</PER> facedown upon the moth-eaten covers, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes shut, <PER>Harry</PER>'s body heavy and aching <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> had journeyed miles and miles It seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago <PER>Cho</PER> Chang had been approaching <PER>Harry</PER> under the mistletoe <PER>Harry</PER> was so tired <PER>Harry</PER> was scared to sleep yet <PER>Harry</PER> did not know how long <PER>Harry</PER> could fight it <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had told <PER>Harry</PER> to stay That must mean <PER>Harry</PER> was allowed to sleep But <PER>Harry</PER> was scared What if it happened again ?
<PER>Harry</PER> was sinking into shadows It was as though a film in <PER>Harry</PER>'s head had been waiting to start.
He was walking down a deserted corridor toward a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway onto a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left He reached the black door but could not open the black door He stood gazing at the black door, desperate for entry Something He wanted with all He's heart lay beyond A prize beyond his dreams If only his scar would stop prickling then he would be able to think more clearly “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice, from far, far away, “Mum says dinner’s ready, but dinner’s’ll save you something if you want to stay in bed” <PER>Harry</PER> opened his eyes, but <PER>Ron</PER> had already left the room.
Not after what <PER>Harry</PER> heard Moody say <PER>Harry</PER> supposed none of them would want <PER>Harry</PER> there anymore now that them knew what was inside <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> would not go down to dinner; <PER>Harry</PER> would not inflict <PER>Harry</PER>'s company upon them.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned over onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s other side and after a while dropped back off to sleep, waking much later in the early hours of the morning, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides aching with hunger, and <PER>Ron</PER> snoring in the next bed.
Squinting around the room <PER>Harry</PER> saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in <PER>Harry</PER>'s portrait and it occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had probably set Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case him attacked somebody else.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; <PER>Harry</PER> was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that <PER>Harry</PER> was to have company over Christmas.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice echoing up through the floor in the cold and empty drawing room where <PER>Harry</PER> was sitting alone, watching the sky outside the windows growing whiter, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that <PER>Harry</PER> was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about <PER>Harry</PER>, as they were bound to be doing.
When <PER>Harry</PER> heard Molly calling <PER>Harry</PER>'s name softly up the stairs around lunchtime <PER>Harry</PER> retreated farther upstairs and ignored Molly.
Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, <PER>Harry</PER> merely settled <PER>Harry</PER> more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak the hippogriff’s room where <PER>Harry</PER> was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry <PER>Harry</PER> felt as <PER>Harry</PER> fed Buckbeak dead rats.
“So I’ve come for Christmas.” There was snow in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face was pink with cold.
When him entered the bedroom him was rather surprised to see both <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> waiting for them, sitting on <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed.
“I came on the Knight Bus,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> airily, pulling off <PER>Hermione</PER>'s jacket before <PER>Harry</PER> had time to speak.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> say you’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. Mungo’s.” “They do, do They?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glaring at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Ron</PER> looked down at his feet but <PER>Ginny</PER> seemed quite unabashed.
“Well, that was a bit stupid of you,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> angrily, “seeing as you don’t know anyone but me who’s been possessed by <PER>Voldemort</PER>, and I can tell you how it feels.” <PER>Harry</PER> remained quite still as the impact of these words hit <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m sorry,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, and <PER>Harry</PER> meant it.
“Are there big blank periods where you don’t know what you’ve been up to?” <PER>Harry</PER> racked <PER>Harry</PER>'s brains.
“Then <PER>Voldemort</PER> hasn’t ever possessed you,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> simply.
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve had these dreams before,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said.
“You had flashes of what <PER>Voldemort</PER> was up to last year.” “This was different,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart swelled with happiness and relief, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past their door toward Buckbeak’s room, singing “God Rest Ye Merry, Hippogriffs” at the top of his voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now <PER>Harry</PER> seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more, than themselves would have done at Hogwarts, and <PER>Harry</PER> worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with themselves's help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable.
<PER>Harry</PER> awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and <PER>Ron</PER> already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.
“Thanks for the Broom Compass, it’s excellent, beats <PER>Hermione</PER>’s — <PER>Hermione</PER>’s got me a homework planner — ” <PER>Harry</PER> sorted through <PER>Harry</PER>'s presents and found one with <PER>Hermione</PER>’s handwriting on it.
<PER>Harry</PER> flicked through the first volume eagerly; <PER>Harry</PER> could see it was going to be highly useful in <PER>Harry</PER>'s plans for the D.A.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately prevented <PER>Harry</PER> putting any money in without getting <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers ripped off.
Tonks’s present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which <PER>Harry</PER> watched fly around the room, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> still had <PER>Harry</PER>'s full-size version; <PER>Ron</PER> had given <PER>Harry</PER> an enormous box of Every-Flavor Beans; Mister and Molly the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies; and Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that <PER>Harry</PER> suspected had been done by the elf himself.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just turned it upside down to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER>'s new homework diary at <PER>Harry</PER>; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily, “If you’ve dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s then you may do whatever you pleasel” They got up and dressed; They could hear various inhabitants of the house calling “Merry Christmas” to each other.
“So, this is Kreacher’s bedroom?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry which <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen open.
“They can leave the house if They really want to,” <PER>Harry</PER> contradicted <PER>Harry</PER>.
Once they had had their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were planning to pay Arthur another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin.
<PER>Harry</PER> and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them; <PER>Harry</PER> and the others strolled casually toward the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass.
It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, although halfway across the room <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> shunted aside by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril.
“It was just — just something Pye and I thought we’d try — only, most unfortunately — well, with these particular kinds of wounds — it doesn’t seem to work as well as we’d hoped — ” “Meaning?” “Well well, I don’t know whether you know what — what stitches are?” “It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back together,” said Molly with a snort of mirthless laughter, “but even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be that stupid — ” “I fancy a cup of tea too,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, jumping to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> almost sprinted to the door with him.
As it swung closed behind them, them heard Molly shriek, “WHAT DO YOU MEAN, “Typical Dad,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, shaking <PER>Ginny</PER>'s head as they set off up the corridor.
“I expect you’d like my autograph, would you?” “Hasn’t changed much, has he?” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered to <PER>Ginny</PER>, who grinned.
It had been <PER>Ron</PER>’s malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart’s memory so badly that he had landed here in the first place, though, as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s memories at the time, <PER>Harry</PER>’s sympathy was limited.
For a few moments he gazed intently at <PER>Harry</PER>, then he said, “Haven’t we met?” “Er yeah, we have,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“This is our long-term resident ward,” she informed <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER> in a low voice.
“You can put them in envelopes,” he said to <PER>Ginny</PER>, throwing the signed pictures into <PER>Ginny</PER>'s lap one by one as he finished them.
Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; <PER>Harry</PER> remembered something similar happening to <PER>Hermione</PER> during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s case, had not been permanent.
<PER>Harry</PER> cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that <PER>Neville</PER> could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned, but <PER>Ron</PER> had looked up at the sound of the name “Longbottom” too, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER> had called, “<PER>Neville</PER>\” <PER>Neville</PER> jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed <PER>Harry</PER>.
“It’s us, <PER>Neville</PER>!” said <PER>Ron</PER> brightly, getting to his feet.
<PER>Neville</PER> looked as though <PER>Neville</PER> would rather be anywhere in the world but here.
“Ah, yes,” said his grandmother, looking closely at <PER>Harry</PER> and sticking out a shriveled, clawlike hand for <PER>Harry</PER> to shake.
<PER>Neville</PER> did not look at <PER>Neville</PER>, but stared at <PER>Neville</PER>'s own feet, the color deepening in <PER>Neville</PER>'s face all the while.
“And you two are clearly Weasleys,” Mistress Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> in turn.
“Yes, I know your parents — not well, of course — but fine people, fine people and you must be <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather startled that Mistress Longbottom knew Mistress Longbottom's name, but shook hands all the same.
“What?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, looking amazed (<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to stamp on <PER>Ron</PER>’s foot, but that sort of thing was much harder to bring off unnoticed when you were wearing jeans rather than robes).
“Haven’t you told your friends about your parents, <PER>Neville</PER>?” <PER>Neville</PER> took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling, and shook <PER>Neville</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not think of any way of helping <PER>Neville</PER> out of the situation.
“My son and his wife,” she said, turning haughtily to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, “were tortured into insanity by You-Know- Who’s followers.” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> both clapped their hands over their mouths.
<PER>Ron</PER> stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents and looked mortified.
“Very well, Alice dear, very well — <PER>Neville</PER>, take it, whatever it is” But <PER>Neville</PER> had already stretched out <PER>Neville</PER>'s hand, into which <PER>Neville</PER>'s mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper.
<PER>Neville</PER> looked around at the others, <PER>Neville</PER>'s expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not think <PER>Harry</PER>’d ever found anything less funny in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> told me but I promised I wouldn’t mention it that’s what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on <PER>Neville</PER>’s parents until they lost their minds.” “Bellatrix Lestrange did that?” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, horrified.
Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on Kreacher's reappearance, Kreacher's bitter muttering had subsided somewhat, and Kreacher submitted to orders more docilely than usual, though once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> caught the house-elf staring avidly at Kreacher, always looking quickly away when Kreacher saw that <PER>Harry</PER> had noticed.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not mention <PER>Harry</PER>'s vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over.
In fact, for the first time in <PER>Harry</PER>'s life, <PER>Harry</PER> was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts.
Going back to school would mean placing <PER>Harry</PER> once again under the tyranny of Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence.
Then there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned; there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; <PER>Dumbledore</PER> remained as remote as ever; in fact, if it had not been for the D.A., <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> might have gone to Sirius and begged <PER>Harry</PER> to let <PER>Harry</PER> leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place.
Then, on the very last day of the holidays, something happened that made <PER>Harry</PER> positively dread <PER>Harry</PER>'s return to school.
“<PER>Harry</PER> dear,” said Molly, poking Molly's head into his and <PER>Ron</PER>’s bedroom, where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Crookshanks, “could you come down to the kitchen?
He looked around at <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, all of whom were gaping back at him.
“<PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> blankly.
“You haven’t done anything, have you?” “No!” said <PER>Harry</PER> indignantly, racking <PER>Harry</PER>'s brains to think what <PER>Harry</PER> could have done that would make <PER>Snape</PER> pursue <PER>Harry</PER> to Grimmauld Place.
Had <PER>Harry</PER> pushed open the kitchen door a minute or two later to find Sirius and <PER>Snape</PER> both seated at the long kitchen table, glaring in opposite directions.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked around at <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>'s face framed between curtains of greasy black hair.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down in a chair beside Sirius, facing <PER>Snape</PER> across the table.
“I am here on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s orders,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, whose voice, by contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, “but by all means stay, Black, I know you like to feel involved.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” said Sirius, letting his chair fall back onto all four legs with a loud bang.
<PER>Snape</PER> ’s lip curled in triumph as he turned to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the horrible sensation that <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides were melting.
Extra lessons with <PER>Snape</PER> — what on earth had <PER>Snape</PER> done to deserve this?
“Why can’t <PER>Dumbledore</PER> teach <PER>Harry</PER>?” asked Sirius aggressively.
He was rather taller than <PER>Snape</PER> who, <PER>Harry</PER> noticed, had balled He's fist in the pocket of his cloak over what <PER>Harry</PER> was sure was the handle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand.
“If I hear you’re using these Occlumency lessons to give <PER>Harry</PER> a hard time, you’ll have me to answer to.” “How touching,” <PER>Snape</PER> sneered.
Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table toward <PER>Snape</PER>, pulling out his wand as his went; <PER>Snape</PER> whipped out <PER>Snape</PER>'s own.
“Sirius!” said <PER>Harry</PER> loudly, but “Sirius appeared not to hear <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’ve warned you, Snivellus,” said Sirius, his face barely a foot from <PER>Snape</PER> ’s, “I don’t care if <PER>Dumbledore</PER> thinks you’ve reformed, I know better — ” “Oh, but why don’t you tell <PER>Dumbledore</PER> so?” whispered <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Or are you afraid <PER>Dumbledore</PER> might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding inside <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s mother’s house for six months very seriously?” “Tell me, how is <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> these days?
“NO!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them, “Sirius, don’t — ” “Are you calling me a coward?” roared Sirius, trying to push <PER>Harry</PER> out of the way, but <PER>Harry</PER> would not budge.
“Completely cured!” he and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and <PER>Snape</PER> looking toward the door with their wands pointing into each other’s faces and <PER>Harry</PER> immobile between them, a hand stretched out to each of them, trying to force them apart.
“Merlin’s beard,” said Arthur, the smile sliding off his face, “what’s going on here?” Both Sirius and <PER>Snape</PER> lowered Both Sirius and <PER>Snape</PER>'s wands.
<PER>Snape</PER> pocketed <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand and swept back across the kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment.
Sirius glared after <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand at his side.
That night’s meal should have been a cheerful one with Arthur back amongst them; <PER>Harry</PER> could tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather was not forcing <PER>Harry</PER> to laugh loudly at Fred and George’s jokes or offering everyone more food, <PER>Harry</PER>'s face fell back into a moody, brooding expression.
<PER>Harry</PER> was separated from <PER>Harry</PER> by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Arthur their congratulations; <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> should not listen to a word <PER>Snape</PER> said, that <PER>Snape</PER> was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them did not think Sirius was a coward for doing as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER> and remaining in Grimmauld Place, but <PER>Harry</PER> had no opportunity to do so, and wondered occasionally, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius’s face, whether <PER>Harry</PER> would have dared to even if <PER>Harry</PER> had the chance.
Instead <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> wants to stop you having those dreams about <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
“Well, you won’t be sorry not to have them anymore, will you?” “Extra lessons with <PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding aghast.
“I’d rather have the nightmares!” They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> arrived there next morning.
<PER>Harry</PER> had an unpleasant constricted sensation in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest; <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to say good-bye to Sirius.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a bad feeling about this parting; <PER>Harry</PER> did not know when they would next see each other and felt that it was incumbent upon <PER>Harry</PER> to say something to Sirius to stop <PER>Harry</PER> doing anything stupid — <PER>Harry</PER> was worried that <PER>Snape</PER>’s accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly — <PER>Harry</PER> might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place.
Before — <PER>Harry</PER> could think of what to say, however, Sirius had beckoned — <PER>Harry</PER> to — <PER>Harry</PER>'s side.
“I doubt Molly would approve — but I want you to use it if you need me, all right?” “Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, stowing the package away in the inside pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s jacket, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> would never use whatever it was.
It would not be he, <PER>Harry</PER>, who lured Sirius from his place of safety, no matter how foully <PER>Snape</PER> treated <PER>Snape</PER> in their forthcoming Occlumency classes.
“Let’s go, then,” said Sirius, clapping <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder and smiling grimly, and before <PER>Harry</PER> could say anything else, they were heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door, surrounded by Weasleys.
his said gruffly, “Look after yourself, <PER>Harry</PER>,” and next moment <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> being shunted out into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall, tweedy woman with iron-gray hair) chivvying <PER>Harry</PER> down the steps.
“On, on, get on — And she shoved <PER>Harry</PER> forward toward the steps, past the conductor, who goggled at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> passed.
“I’ve always wanted to go on this thing,” said <PER>Ron</PER> happily, joining <PER>Harry</PER> on board and looking around.
“Fred, George, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, if you just take those seats at the back Remus can stay with you” She, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> proceeded up to the very top deck, where there were two chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back.
Stan Shunpike, the conductor, followed <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> eagerly to the back.
Heads turned as <PER>Harry</PER> passed and when <PER>Harry</PER> sat down, <PER>Harry</PER> saw all the faces flick back to the front again.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> handed Stan eleven Sickles each, the bus set off again, swaying ominously.
It rumbled around Grimmauld Square, weaving on and off the pavement, then, with another tremendous BANG, they were all flung backward; <PER>Ron</PER>’s chair toppled right over and Pigwidgeon, who had been on his lap, burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down upon <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder instead.
<PER>Harry</PER>, who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket, looked out of the window: <PER>Harry</PER>, who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway.
“Just outside Birmingham,” said Stan happily, answering <PER>Harry</PER>’s unasked question as <PER>Ron</PER> struggled up from the floor.
Looking toward the front of the bus <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Hermione</PER> cover her eyes with her hands, Pigwidgeon still swaying happily on her shoulder.
“And listen ” <PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice while the rest of them exchanged last-minute good-byes with Tonks, “<PER>Harry</PER>, I know you don’t like <PER>Snape</PER>, but <PER>Snape</PER> is a superb Occlumens and we all — Sirius included — want you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right?” “Yeah, all right,” said <PER>Harry</PER> heavily, looking up into Lupin’s prematurely lined face.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced back when they reached the oak front doors; the Knight Bus had already gone, and <PER>Harry</PER> half-wished, given what was coming the following day, that <PER>Harry</PER> was still on board.
<PER>Harry</PER> morning Potions lesson did nothing to dispel <PER>Harry</PER>'s trepidation, as <PER>Snape</PER> was as unpleasant as ever, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s mood was further lowered by the fact that members of the D.A.
“I’ll let you know when the next one is,” <PER>Harry</PER> said over and over again, “but I can’t do it tonight, I’ve got to go to — er — Remedial Potions” “You take Remedial Potions?” asked Zacharias Smith superciliously, having cornered <PER>Harry</PER> in the entrance hall after lunch.
“Good Lord, you must be terrible, <PER>Snape</PER> doesn’t usually give extra lessons, does <PER>Snape</PER>?” As Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion, <PER>Ron</PER> glared after him.
“Oh,” said <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach leapt uncomfortably.
“Hi.” “We’ll be in the library, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> firmly, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seized <PER>Ron</PER> above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble staircase.
<PER>Harry</PER> stood staring after her, <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain working frantically.
“Right well that’s settled then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all, <PER>Harry</PER> headed off to the library to pick up <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> before their afternoon lessons, walking in a rather bouncy way himself.
By six o’clock that evening, however, even the glow of having successfully asked out <PER>Cho</PER> Chang was insufficient to lighten the ominous feelings that intensified with every step <PER>Harry</PER> took toward <PER>Snape</PER>’s office.
<PER>Harry</PER> paused outside the door when <PER>Harry</PER> reached the door, wishing <PER>Harry</PER> were almost anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, knocked, and entered.
In a corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that <PER>Snape</PER> had once accused <PER>Harry</PER> — not without reason — of robbing.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized it at once — <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve.
Wondering what on earth it was doing here, <PER>Harry</PER> jumped when <PER>Snape</PER>’s cold voice came out of the corner.
“Shut the door behind you, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> did as <PER>Harry</PER> was told with the horrible feeling that <PER>Harry</PER> was imprisoning <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> did so.
When <PER>Harry</PER> turned back to face the room <PER>Snape</PER> had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite <PER>Harry</PER>'s desk.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down and so did <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon <PER>Harry</PER>, dislike etched in every line of <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, his eyes narrowed malevolently, “but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ‘sir’ or ‘Professor’ at all times.” “Yes sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked back at <PER>Snape</PER> for a moment and then said contemptuously, “Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter?
“But why does Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> want to stop it?” Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> asked abruptly.
“It appears that <PER>Voldemort</PER> has been unaware of the connection between you and <PER>Voldemort</PER> until very recently.
“As I was saying the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts — ” “I saw inside the snake’s head, not his!” “I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter?” But <PER>Harry</PER> did not care if <PER>Snape</PER> was angry; at <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business.
<PER>Harry</PER> had moved forward in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair so that, without realizing it, <PER>Harry</PER> was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts I’m sharing?” “Do not say <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name\” spat <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> says Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s name,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is an extremely powerful wizard,” <PER>Snape</PER> muttered.
“While <PER>Snape</PER> may feel secure enough to use the name the rest of us ” <PER>Snape</PER> rubbed <PER>Snape</PER>'s left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where <PER>Harry</PER> knew the Dark Mark was burned into <PER>Harry</PER>'s skin.
“I just wanted to know,” <PER>Harry</PER> began again, forcing <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice back to politeness, “why — ” “You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where <PER>Voldemort</PER> was at that particular moment,” snarled <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER> was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too” “And Vol — he — realized I was there?” “It seems so,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coolly.
“Is this just Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> guessing, or — ?” “I told you,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, rigid in his chair, his eyes slits, “to call me ‘sir.’ ” “Yes, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, “but how do you know — ?” “It is enough that we know,” said <PER>Snape</PER> repressively.
“The important point is that <PER>Voldemort</PER> is now aware that you are gaining access to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s thoughts and feelings.
“Which brings us back to Occlumency.” <PER>Snape</PER> pulled out <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand from an inside pocket of his robes and <PER>Harry</PER> tensed in his chair, but <PER>Snape</PER> merely raised the wand to <PER>Snape</PER>'s temple and placed his temple tip into the greasy roots of <PER>Snape</PER>'s hair.
When <PER>Snape</PER> withdrew it, some silvery substance came away, stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand, which broke as <PER>Snape</PER> pulled the wand away from the wand and fell gracefully into the Pensieve, where it swirled silvery white, neither gas nor liquid.
Twice more <PER>Snape</PER> raised the wand to <PER>Snape</PER>'s temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin, then, without offering any explanation of his behavior, his picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed the Pensieve to a shelf out of their way and returned to face <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand held at the ready.
“Stand up and take out your wand, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet feeling nervous.
“And what are you going to do?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, eyeing <PER>Snape</PER> ’s wand apprehensively.
“To whom did the dog belong?” “My Aunt Marge,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, hating <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, raising <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand once more.
“Now, I want you to close your eyes.” <PER>Harry</PER> threw him a filthy look before doing as <PER>Harry</PER> was told.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not like the idea of standing there with <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes shut while <PER>Snape</PER> faced him, carrying a wand.
“Let go of all emotion” But <PER>Harry</PER>’s anger at <PER>Snape</PER> continued to pound through <PER>Harry</PER>’s's veins like venom.
his could as easily detach his legs “You’re not doing it, Potter You will need more discipline than this Focus, now” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, tried not to think, or remember, or feel “Let’s go again on the count of three one — two — three — Legilimensl” A great black dragon was rearing in front of him him father and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him him was on his knees again, him's face buried in him's hands, him's brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from him's skull.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked paler than usual, and angrier, though not nearly as angry as <PER>Harry</PER> was.
“Then you will find yourself easy prey for <PER>the Dark Lord</PER>!” said <PER>Snape</PER> savagely.
It looked as though, this time, <PER>Snape</PER> had lifted the spell before <PER>Harry</PER> had even tried to fight back.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not answer at once; <PER>Harry</PER> was still savoring the moment of blinding realization as <PER>Harry</PER> rubbed <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead <PER>Harry</PER> had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months, without once realizing that it was a real place.
Now, seeing the memory again, <PER>Harry</PER> knew that all along <PER>Harry</PER> had been dreaming about the corridor down which <PER>Harry</PER> had run with Arthur on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry.
“What’s in the Department of Mysteries?” “What did you say?” <PER>Snape</PER> asked quietly and <PER>Harry</PER> saw, with deep satisfaction, that <PER>Snape</PER> was unnerved.
“And why,” said <PER>Snape</PER> slowly, “would you ask such a thing?” “Because,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching <PER>Snape</PER> closely for a reaction, “that corridor I’ve just seen — I’ve been dreaming about it for months — I’ve just recognized it — it leads to the Department of Mysteries and I think <PER>Voldemort</PER> wants something from — ” “I have told you not to say <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s name\” They glared at each other.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s scar seared again, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not care.
When <PER>Snape</PER> spoke again <PER>Snape</PER> sounded as though <PER>Snape</PER> was trying to appear cool and unconcerned.
“There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, few of which you would understand and none of which concern you, do I make myself plain?” “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, still rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s prickling scar, which was becoming more painful.
He was desperate to get out of <PER>Snape</PER> ’s office and find <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> picked up <PER>Harry</PER>'s schoolbag, swung it over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, and hurried toward the office door.
As he opened it he glanced back at <PER>Snape</PER>, who had his back to <PER>Harry</PER> and was scooping <PER>Harry</PER>'s own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head.
<PER>Harry</PER> left without another word, closing the door carefully behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar still throbbing painfully.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the library, where they were working on <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s most recent ream of homework.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt shivery; <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar was still aching, <PER>Harry</PER> felt almost feverish.
When <PER>Harry</PER> sat down opposite <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> caught sight of <PER>Harry</PER> in the window opposite.
“How did it go?” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, and then, looking concerned, “Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yeah fine I dunno,” said <PER>Harry</PER> impatiently, wincing as pain shot through <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar again.
“Listen I’ve just realized something” And <PER>Harry</PER> told them what <PER>Harry</PER> had just seen and deduced.
“So so, are you saying ” whispered <PER>Ron</PER>, as Madam Pince swept past, squeaking slightly, “that the weapon — the thing You-Know- Who’s after — is in the Ministry of Magic?” “In the Department of Mysteries, it’s got to be,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, think about it Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic It must have been that one, it’s too much of a coincidence!” “How come Sturgis was trying to break in when Sturgis’s on our side?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“That is a bit odd” “So what’s in the Department of Mysteries?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect <PER>Harry</PER>, are you sure you’re all right?” For <PER>Harry</PER> had just run both <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands hard over <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead as though trying to iron it.
“How do those hats work, then?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, distracted from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s homework and watching Fred and George.
“So you don’t forget!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> exchanged looks as <PER>Harry</PER> reached into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, withdrew the planner and opened's bag tentatively.
“ Don’t leave it till later, you big second-rateri” chided the book as <PER>Harry</PER> scribbled down <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s homework.
“I think 111 go to bed,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, stuffing the homework planner back into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity <PER>Harry</PER> got.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried to put a Headless Hat on <PER>Harry</PER>, and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys’ dormitories.
<PER>Harry</PER> was feeling sick again, just as <PER>Harry</PER> had the night <PER>Harry</PER> had had the vision of the snake, but thought that if <PER>Harry</PER> could just lie down for a while <PER>Harry</PER> would be all right.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened the door of <PER>Harry</PER>'s dormitory and was one step inside it when <PER>Harry</PER> experienced pain so severe <PER>Harry</PER> thought that someone must have sliced into the top of someone's head.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know where <PER>Harry</PER> was, whether <PER>Harry</PER> was standing or lying down, <PER>Harry</PER> did not even know <PER>Harry</PER>'s own name Maniacal laughter was ringing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears <PER>Harry</PER> was happier than <PER>Harry</PER> had been in a very long time Jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant A wonderful, wonderful thing had happened “<PER>Harry</PER>?
The moment he realized this, it died away; <PER>Harry</PER> lay panting on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead throbbing horribly.
<PER>Ron</PER> was bending over <PER>Harry</PER>, looking very worried.
“He’s really happy really happy ” “<PER>Voldemort</PER> is?” “Something good’s happened,” mumbled <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was shaking as badly as <PER>Harry</PER> had done after seeing the snake attack Arthur and felt very sick.
“Something <PER>Harry</PER>’s been hoping for.” The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking them through <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth, yet <PER>Harry</PER> knew them were true.
<PER>Harry</PER> took deep breaths, willing <PER>Harry</PER> not to vomit all over <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> told me to come and check on you,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a low voice, helping <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“She says your defenses will be low at the moment, after <PER>Snape</PER>’s been fiddling around with your mind Still, I suppose it’ll help in the long run, won’t it?” He looked doubtfully at <PER>Harry</PER> as He helped him toward bed.
<PER>Harry</PER> nodded without any conviction and slumped back on <PER>Harry</PER>'s pillows, aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar still prickling painfully.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not help feeling that <PER>Harry</PER>'s first foray into Occlumency had weakened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind’s resistance rather than strengthening it, and <PER>Harry</PER> wondered, with a feeling of great trepidation, what had happened to make Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> the happiest Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been in fourteen years.
When <PER>Hermione</PER>’s Daily Prophet arrived <PER>Hermione</PER>’s Daily Prophet smoothed it out, gazed for a moment at the front page, and then gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> together.
Her face had leapt out at <PER>Harry</PER> the moment <PER>Harry</PER> had seen the page.
<PER>Hermione</PER> nudged <PER>Harry</PER> and pointed at the headline over the pictures, which <PER>Harry</PER>, concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read.
“That’s why he was happy last night” “I don’t believe this,” snarled <PER>Harry</PER>, “Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius?” “What other options does he have?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> bitterly.
“he can hardly say, ‘Sorry everyone, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> warned me this might happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>’ — stop whimpering, <PER>Ron</PER> — ‘and now <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s worst supporters have broken out too.’ I mean, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s spent a good six months telling everyone you and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> are liars, hasn’t <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s?” <PER>Hermione</PER> ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while <PER>Harry</PER> looked around the Great Hall.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not understand why <PER>Harry</PER>'s fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of fellow students took the newspaper every day like <PER>Hermione</PER>.
There they all were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish, and outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s ranks <PER>Voldemort</PER> glanced up at the staff table.
It was a different story here: <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave.
She scowled as She gulped down Shis food and every now and then She shot a malevolent glance up the table to where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>McGonagall</PER> were talking so intently.
<PER>Hermione</PER> folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it back to <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“To send a letter,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, swinging <PER>Hermione</PER>'s bag onto <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shoulder.
“It well, I don’t know whether but it’s worth trying and I’m the only one who can “I hate it when she does that,” grumbled <PER>Ron</PER> as he and <PER>Harry</PER> got up from the table and made their own, slower way out of the Great Hall.
“Are you okay, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, following <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> lumbered after the Ravenclaws.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> go, wondering how much more bad news <PER>Harry</PER> could stand.
The fact that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days, but to <PER>Harry</PER>’s indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people, <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> prominent among them, seemed positively gleeful.
As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St. Mungo’s, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to be the only people who knew or cared.
Those who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s; the crimes they had committed during the days of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s reign of terror were legendary.
It was true that <PER>Harry</PER> was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers’ voices.
They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophet’s version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of Azkaban fortress.
In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them, the one that <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been expounding since the previous year.
“their obviously can’t talk freely in the staffroom anymore,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a low voice, as she, <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Ron</PER> passed Professors <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Flitwick, and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day.
“Not with <PER>Umbridge</PER> there.” “Reckon they know anything new?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers.
<PER>Harry</PER> had thought that the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled <PER>Umbridge</PER> a little, that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under shis beloved Fudge’s nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought that Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain; several times <PER>Harry</PER> passed her in the corridors (in itself a very unusual occurrence as her generally remained in her tower room), muttering wildly to her, wringing her hands, and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder, all the time giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry.
If he had not been so worried about <PER>Hagrid</PER>, he would have felt sorry for her — but if one of them was to be ousted out of a job, there could be only one choice for <PER>Harry</PER> as to who should remain.
Unfortunately, <PER>Harry</PER> could not see that <PER>Hagrid</PER> was putting up a better show than Trelawney.
he was also more distant with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> than he had ever been before, expressly forbidding them to visit he after dark.
It seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Umbridge</PER> was steadily depriving <PER>Harry</PER> of everything that made <PER>Harry</PER>'s life at Hogwarts worth living: visits to <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s house, letters from Sirius, his Firebolt, and Quidditch.
<PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in <PER>Neville</PER>.
his had not once mentioned his meeting with <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> on the closed ward in St. Mungo’s, and taking their lead from him, their had kept quiet about it too.
meetings anymore, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and countercurse <PER>Harry</PER> taught them, <PER>Harry</PER>'s plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents, working harder than anyone else in the room.
He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when <PER>Harry</PER> taught them the Shield Charm, a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that them rebounded upon the attacker, only <PER>Hermione</PER> mastered the charm faster than <PER>Neville</PER>.
In fact <PER>Harry</PER> would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as <PER>Neville</PER> was making during D.A.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s sessions with <PER>Snape</PER>, which had started badly enough, were not improving; on the contrary, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> was getting worse with every lesson.
Before <PER>Harry</PER> had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thoughts or moods that <PER>Voldemort</PER> experienced every now and then.
Nowadays, however, <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to <PER>Voldemort</PER> at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> had the horrible impression that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s mood, and <PER>Voldemort</PER> was sure <PER>Voldemort</PER> could date this increased sensitivity firmly from <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s first Occlumency lesson with <PER>Snape</PER>.
What was more, <PER>Voldemort</PER> was now dreaming about walking down the corridor toward the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams that always culminated in <PER>Voldemort</PER> standing longingly in front of the plain black door.
“Maybe it’s a bit like an illness,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking concerned when <PER>Harry</PER> confided in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s and <PER>Ron</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> doesn’t want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wouldn’t have asked <PER>Snape</PER> to teach you Occlumency.
“You try it sometime, <PER>Snape</PER> trying to get inside your head, it’s not a bundle of laughs, you know!” “Maybe ” said <PER>Ron</PER> slowly.
“Maybe it’s not <PER>Harry</PER>’s fault <PER>Harry</PER> can’t close <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind,” said <PER>Ron</PER> darkly.
“Well, maybe <PER>Snape</PER> isn’t really trying to help <PER>Harry</PER>” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stared at <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Maybe,” he said again in a lower voice, “he’s actually trying to open <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind a bit wider make it easier for You-Know — ” “Shut up, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily.
“And we’ve never seen proof that he really swapped sides” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> trusts him,” <PER>Hermione</PER> repeated.
<PER>Harry</PER> had had very little time to spare on conversations with <PER>Cho</PER> since they had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found <PER>Harry</PER> facing a Valentine’s Day spent entirely in <PER>Cho</PER>'s company.
“Listen, <PER>Harry</PER>,” she said, looking up at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Cho</PER> might be expecting me to spend the whole day with <PER>Cho</PER>.
“Are you coming?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Ron</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> shook his head, looking glum.
<PER>Harry</PER> found it very hard to be sympathetic to <PER>Ron</PER>’s plight when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed to notice <PER>Harry</PER>’s tone, because <PER>Harry</PER> did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said good-bye to each other shortly afterward.
<PER>Ron</PER> departed for the Quidditch pitch and <PER>Harry</PER>, after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the entrance hall to meet <PER>Cho</PER>, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s feet seemed to be too big for <PER>Harry</PER>’s's body as <PER>Harry</PER>’s walked toward She, and <PER>Harry</PER>’s was suddenly horribly aware of <PER>Harry</PER>’s's arms and how stupid they looked swinging at <PER>Harry</PER>’s's sides.
It was a fresh, breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium, <PER>Harry</PER> glimpsed <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> skimming over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them “You really miss it, don’t you?” said <PER>Cho</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her, no more difficult, in fact, than talking to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson.
“Urgh, Chang, I don’t think much of your taste At least Diggory was good-looking!” They sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER>, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake.
<PER>Harry</PER> could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and <PER>Cho</PER>, slightly flushed, was watching <PER>Cho</PER>'s feet.
They moved aside when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER> approached and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> staring once more at the ten pictures of the escaped Death Eaters.
It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft’s; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting <PER>Harry</PER>’s face and the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck.
<PER>Harry</PER> was reminded unpleasantly of <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office.
The sight made <PER>Harry</PER> feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the tea shop, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that it was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands.
Perhaps <PER>Cho</PER> would expect <PER>Cho</PER> to hold <PER>Cho</PER>'s hand.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished they wouldn’t; <PER>Harry</PER> felt that Roger Davies was setting a standard with which <PER>Cho</PER> would soon expect <PER>Harry</PER> to compete.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up <PER>Harry</PER> could not see the street outside.
To postpone the moment when <PER>Harry</PER> had to look at <PER>Cho</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub.
After a few more painful minutes <PER>Cho</PER> mentioned <PER>Umbridge</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing <PER>Cho</PER>, but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during D.A.
A few more minutes passed in total silence, <PER>Harry</PER> drinking <PER>Harry</PER>'s coffee so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> would soon need a fresh cup.
<PER>Cho</PER>’s hand was lying on the table beside her coffee, and <PER>Harry</PER> was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it.
Just do it, <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
Just reach out and grab it Amazing how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair But just as he moved his hand forward, <PER>Cho</PER> took <PER>Cho</PER> off the table.
<PER>Cho</PER> was now watching Roger Davies kissing <PER>Cho</PER>'s girlfriend with a mildly interested expression.
“I’ve been meaning to ask you for ages Did Cedric — did he m-m-mention me at all before he died?” This was the very last subject on earth <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to discuss, and least of all with <PER>Cho</PER>.
“Well — I have talked about it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said in a whisper, “to <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, but — ” “Oh, you’ll talk to <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger!” she said shrilly, shis face now shining with tears, and several more kissing couples broke apart to stare.
“<PER>Cho</PER>?” <PER>Cho</PER>?
“I don’t know why you asked me out in the first place if you’re going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me How many are you meeting after <PER>Hermione</PER>?” “It’s not like that!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that <PER>Harry</PER> laughed, which <PER>Harry</PER> realized a split second too late was a mistake.
<PER>Cho</PER> sprang to <PER>Cho</PER>'s feet.
“<PER>Cho</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle.
“Hi, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” <PER>Hagrid</PER>!
<PER>Hagrid</PER> jumped and looked down at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER> barely recognized <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> had two fresh cuts on <PER>Harry</PER>'s face and several new bruises.
“Oh, it’s you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“You all righ’?” “Yeah, I’m fine,” lied <PER>Harry</PER>; in fact, next to this battered and mournful-looking <PER>Hagrid</PER>, he felt he did not have much to complain about.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not know what to say to <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then <PER>Hagrid</PER> said abruptly, “In the same boat, you an’ me, aren’ we, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Er — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, unable to stop <PER>Harry</PER>, “where are you getting all these injuries?” “Eh?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, looking startled.
“Wha’ injuries?” “All those!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing at <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face.
“Oh tha’s jus’ normal bumps an’ bruises, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> dismissively.
“I’ll be seein’yeh, <PER>Harry</PER> Take care now” And <PER>Harry</PER> lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and then disappeared into the torrential rain.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> go, feeling miserable.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> was unhappy and <PER>Harry</PER> was hiding something, but <PER>Harry</PER> seemed determined not to accept help.
But before <PER>Harry</PER> could think about the matter any further, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a voice calling <PER>Harry</PER>'s name.
He was still a few tables away when He realized that <PER>Hermione</PER> was not alone; <PER>Hermione</PER> was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates He could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter, ex- journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s least favorite people in the world.
“I thought you were with <PER>Cho</PER>, I wasn’t expecting you for another hour at least!” “<PER>Cho</PER>?” said <PER>Rita</PER> at once, twisting around in <PER>Cho</PER>'s seat to stare avidly at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“A girl?” <PER>Cho</PER> snatched up <PER>Cho</PER>'s crocodile-skin handbag and groped within crocodile-skin handbag.
“It’s none of your business if <PER>Harry</PER>’s been with a hundred girls,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Rita</PER> coolly.
“So you can put that away right now.” <PER>Rita</PER> had been on the point of withdrawing an acid- green quill from <PER>Rita</PER>'s bag.
Looking as though <PER>Rita</PER> had been forced to swallow Stinksap, <PER>Rita</PER> snapped <PER>Rita</PER>'s bag shut again.
“What are you up to?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, sitting down and staring from <PER>Rita</PER> to Luna to <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,” said <PER>Rita</PER>, taking a large slurp of <PER>Rita</PER>'s drink.
her took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth, “Pretty girl, is she, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “One more word about <PER>Harry</PER>’s love life and the deal’s off and that’s a promise,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> irritably.
“What deal?” said <PER>Rita</PER>, wiping <PER>Rita</PER>'s mouth on the back of <PER>Rita</PER>'s hand.
“Yes, yes, one of these days you’ll write more horrible stories about <PER>Harry</PER> and me,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> indifferently.
“Find someone who cares, why don’t you?” “They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about <PER>Harry</PER> this year without my help,” said <PER>Rita</PER>, shooting a sideways look at <PER>Harry</PER> over the top of <PER>Rita</PER>'s glass and adding in a rough whisper, “How has that made you feel, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Because <PER>Harry</PER>’s told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister’s too much of an idiot to believe him.” “So you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named is back?” said <PER>Rita</PER>, lowering <PER>Rita</PER>'s glass and subjecting <PER>Harry</PER> to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag.
“You stand by all this garbage <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s been telling everybody about You- Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness “I wasn’t the sole witness,” snarled <PER>Harry</PER>.
“A great bold headline: ‘Potter Accuses ’A subheading: ‘<PER>Harry</PER> Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us.’ And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you: ‘Disturbed teenage survivor of <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s attack, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, 1 5, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the Wizarding community of being Death Eaters’ ” The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression died out of her face.
“But of course,” her said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Little Miss Perfect wouldn’t want that story out there, would her?” “As a matter of fact,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sweetly, “that’s exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.” <PER>Rita</PER> stared at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“You want me to report what he says about He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named?” <PER>Rita</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> in a hushed voice.
<PER>Rita</PER> blotted the front of <PER>Rita</PER>'s grubby raincoat, still staring at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Rita</PER> gave <PER>Hermione</PER> a long, hard look.
Then, leaning forward across the table toward <PER>Rita</PER>, <PER>Rita</PER> said in a businesslike tone, “All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing.
<PER>Rita</PER> sat up straight again, <PER>Rita</PER>'s eyebrows raised, and drained <PER>Rita</PER>'s glass of firewhisky.
“They do it because it’s an honor, and, of course, to see They's names in print.” <PER>Rita</PER> Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“I’m supposed to do this for free?” “Well, yes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> calmly, taking a sip of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s drink.
“Okay, <PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, turning to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Ready to tell the public the truth?” “I suppose,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, watching <PER>Rita</PER> balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them.
“Fire away, then, <PER>Rita</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> serenely, fishing a cherry out of the bottom of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s glass.
Luna said vaguely that Luna did not know how soon <PER>Rita</PER>’s interview with <PER>Harry</PER> would appear in The Quibbler, that Luna's father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when <PER>Voldemort</PER> had returned.
<PER>Rita</PER> had pressed <PER>Harry</PER> for every little detail, and <PER>Harry</PER> had given <PER>Rita</PER>'s everything him could remember, knowing that this was him's one big opportunity to tell the world the truth.
But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given <PER>Harry</PER> a burning desire to do something, whether it worked or not “Can’t wait to see what <PER>Umbridge</PER> thinks of you going public,” said Dean, sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night.
Seamus was shoveling down large amounts of chicken-and-ham pie on Dean’s other side, but <PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was listening.
“It’s the right thing to do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, who was sitting opposite him.
him was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, “It must have been tough talking about it Was it?” “Yeah,” mumbled <PER>Harry</PER>, “but people have got to know what <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s capable of, haven’t people?” “That’s right,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, nodding, “and his Death Eaters too People should know” <PER>Neville</PER> left <PER>Neville</PER>'s sentence hanging and returned to <PER>Neville</PER>'s baked potato.
After a while Dean, Seamus, and <PER>Neville</PER> departed for the common room, leaving <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> at the table waiting for <PER>Ron</PER>, who had not yet had dinner because of Quidditch practice.
<PER>Cho</PER> Chang walked into the hall with <PER>Cho</PER> Chang's friend Marietta.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach gave an unpleasant lurch, but <PER>Cho</PER> Chang did not look over at the Gryffindor table and sat down with <PER>Cho</PER> Chang's back to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Oh, I forgot to ask you,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> brightly, glancing over at the Ravenclaw table, “what happened on your date with <PER>Cho</PER>?
so then,” he finished several minutes later, as the final bit of crumble disappeared, “<PER>Hermione</PER> jumps up, right, and says ‘111 see you around, <PER>Harry</PER>,’ and runs out of the place!” <PER>Harry</PER> put down <PER>Harry</PER>'s spoon and looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“One minute we were getting on fine, next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked shis out, and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid tea shop — how was I supposed to feel about that?” “Well, you see,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, with the patient air of one explaining that one plus one equals two to an overemotional toddler, “you shouldn’t have told shis that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date.” “But, but,” spluttered <PER>Harry</PER>, “but — you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that without telling shis — ?” “You should have told shis differently” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, still with that maddeningly patient air.
“You should have said it was really annoying, but I’d made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn’t want to go, you’d much rather spend the whole day with <PER>Hermione</PER>, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would <PER>Hermione</PER> please, please come along with you, and hopefully you’d be able to get away more quickly?
“<PER>Harry</PER>, you’re worse than <PER>Ron</PER> Well, no, you’re not,” she sighed, as <PER>Ron</PER> himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy.
“Look — you upset <PER>Cho</PER> when you said you were going to meet me, so <PER>Cho</PER> tried to make you jealous.
“Well, wouldn’t it have been easier if <PER>Cho</PER>’d just asked me whether I liked <PER>Cho</PER>'s better than you?” “Girls don’t often ask questions like that,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Then I could’ve just told her I fancy her, and her wouldn’t have had to get her all worked up again about Cedric dying!” “I’m not saying what her did was sensible,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Ginny</PER> joined them, just as muddy as <PER>Ron</PER> and looking equally disgruntled.
“I’m just trying to make you see how her was feeling at the time.” “You should write a book,” <PER>Ron</PER> told <PER>Hermione</PER> as he cut up his potatoes, “translating mad things girls do so boys can understand girls.” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table.
<PER>Cho</PER> had just got up; still not looking at <PER>Cho</PER>, <PER>Cho</PER> left the Great Hall.
Feeling rather depressed, <PER>Cho</PER> looked back at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Oh come on,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking at <PER>Ginny</PER>, “I’m sure it wasn’t that — ” “Yes, it was,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> not here?” asked Fred, looking around as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled up a chair and, when <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head, <PER>Harry</PER> said, “Good.
“Well — that’d explain it.” “Has <PER>Ron</PER> saved a goal yet?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms.
“That’s the trouble with Quidditch,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> absentmindedly, once again bent over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Rune translation, “it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the Houses.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked up to find her copy of Spellman’s Syllabary and caught Fred, George, and <PER>Harry</PER> looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces.
“It’s only a game, isn’t it?” “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking his head, “you’re good on feelings and stuff, but you just don’t understand about Quidditch.” “Maybe not,” she said darkly, returning to shis translation again, “but at least my happiness doesn’t depend on <PER>Ron</PER>’s goalkeeping ability.” And though <PER>Harry</PER> would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her, by the time <PER>Harry</PER> had watched the game the following Saturday <PER>Harry</PER> would have given any number of Galleons not to care about Quidditch either.
It was hard to say what the worst thing was: <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was a close-run contest between <PER>Ron</PER>’s fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backward off Kirke's broom as Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle.
“Good catch,” <PER>Harry</PER> told <PER>Ginny</PER> back in the common room, where the atmosphere closely resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral.
“Angelina still won’t let him resign,” <PER>Ginny</PER> said, as though reading <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind.
“Angelina says Angelina knows <PER>Harry</PER>’s got it in <PER>Harry</PER>.” <PER>Harry</PER> liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in <PER>Ron</PER>, but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team.
Out of respect for <PER>Harry</PER>'s feelings, <PER>Harry</PER> waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself, so that <PER>Ron</PER> could pretend to be asleep if <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to.
Sure enough, when <PER>Harry</PER> finally entered the room <PER>Ron</PER> was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible.
He was quite impressed by <PER>Ginny</PER>’s performance but He felt that if He had been playing He could have caught the Snitch sooner There had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke’s ankle; if she hadn’t hesitated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had been sitting a few rows below <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
he tried for a moment or two, but the thought of <PER>Snape</PER> on top of memories of <PER>Umbridge</PER> merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment, and he found he focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them.
It took <PER>Harry</PER> much longer to get to sleep; <PER>Harry</PER>'s body was tired, but it took <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain a long time to close down.
<PER>Harry</PER> dreamed that <PER>Neville</PER> and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> played the bagpipes.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched them happily for a while, then decided to go and find the other members of the D.A But when <PER>Harry</PER> left the room <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> facing, not the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head slowly to the left.
He had the strangest feeling that this time He was going to get lucky at last, and find the way to open it He was feet from it and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right-hand side The door was ajar He stretched out He's hand to push it wide and — <PER>Ron</PER> gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore, and <PER>Harry</PER> awoke abruptly with <PER>Harry</PER>'s right hand stretched in front of <PER>Harry</PER> in the darkness, to open a door that was hundreds of miles away.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> should not have seen the door, but at the same time, felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that <PER>Harry</PER> could not help feeling annoyed with <PER>Ron</PER> If <PER>Harry</PER> could have saved <PER>Harry</PER>'s snore for just another minute k k k They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on Monday morning.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was not the only person eagerly awaiting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Daily Prophet: Nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many reported sightings, had still not been caught.
She gave the delivery owl a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while <PER>Harry</PER> helped <PER>Harry</PER> to orange juice; as <PER>Harry</PER> had only received one note during the entire year <PER>Harry</PER> was sure, when the first owl landed with a thud in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, that it had made a mistake.
“Who ’re you after?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked it, languidly removing <PER>Harry</PER>'s orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forward to see the recipient’s name and address: <PER>Harry</PER> Potter Great Hall Hogwarts School Frowning, <PER>Harry</PER> made to take the letter from the owl, but before <PER>Harry</PER> could do so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside its beak and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter, knocking over the salt, and each attempting to give he three, four, five more owls's letters first.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly, plunging <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both started ripping open envelopes.
“Says you don’t come across as a mad person, but he really doesn’t want to believe You-Know- Who’s back so he doesn’t know what to think now Blimey, what a waste of parchment ” “Here’s another one you’ve convinced, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> excitedly.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up with <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands full of envelopes.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was standing behind Fred and Luna, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s bulging toad’s eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, Potter?” <PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, but Potter?” did not see how Potter?” could keep what Potter?” had done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s attention.
he had the strangest feeling that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had been watching <PER>Dumbledore</PER> a second before, but when he looked, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick.
Signed: Dolores Jane <PER>Umbridge</PER> For some reason, every time <PER>Hermione</PER> caught sight of one of these signs <PER>Hermione</PER> beamed with pleasure.
“Oh <PER>Harry</PER>, don’t you see?” <PER>Hermione</PER> breathed.
By the end of that day, though <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school, the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview at each other; <PER>Harry</PER> heard them whispering about it as them queued up outside classes, discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons, while <PER>Hermione</PER> even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls’ toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before Ancient Runes.
“And then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, so they were bombarding me with questions,” <PER>Hermione</PER> told <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes shining, “and <PER>Harry</PER>, I think they believe you, I really do, I think you’ve finally got they convinced!” Meanwhile Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was stalking the school, stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets.
Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when <PER>Harry</PER> passed her a watering can; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on <PER>Harry</PER> at the end of Charms, said “Shh\” and hurried away; and Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving <PER>Umbridge</PER>, that <PER>Harry</PER> was not going to suffer an early death after all, but would live to a ripe old age, become Minister of Magic, and have twelve children.
But what made <PER>Harry</PER> happiest was <PER>Cho</PER> catching up with <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Cho</PER> was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day.
them looked around at <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> browsed the shelves for the book <PER>Harry</PER> needed on Partial Vanishment, and Goyle cracked <PER>Harry</PER>'s knuckles threateningly and <PER>Malfoy</PER> whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: <PER>Harry</PER> had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters.
“He can’t believe it, He says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple- Horned Snorkacks!” <PER>Harry</PER> was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night; daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like “The Ministry are morons” and “Eat dung, <PER>Umbridge</PER>” in a booming voice.
<PER>Hermione</PER> did not find this very amusing; <PER>Hermione</PER> said it interfered with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s concentration, and ended up going to bed early out of irritation.
<PER>Harry</PER> had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like “Dung” and “<PER>Umbridge</PER>” at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice.
<PER>Harry</PER> relinquished <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip upon the chair and walked around the chair, closer to the man cowering upon the floor, until he stood directly over he in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual.
“Yes, My Lord, yes I used to work in the department after — after all” “Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.” Bode could never have taken it, Bode would have known Bode could not Undoubtedly that is why Bode fought so hard against <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s Imperius Curse” “Stand up, Rookwood,” whispered <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> flailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings, and fell out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed.
For a few seconds <PER>Harry</PER> did not know where <PER>Harry</PER> was; <PER>Harry</PER> was convinced that <PER>Harry</PER> was about to see the white, skull-like face looming at him out of the dark again, then <PER>Ron</PER>’s voice spoke very near to him.
“Will you stop acting like a maniac, and I can get you out of here!” <PER>Ron</PER> wrenched the hangings apart, and <PER>Harry</PER> stared up at him in the moonlight, as him lay flat on him's back, him's scar searing with pain.
“Has someone been attacked again?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> roughly to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
“But Rookwood’s going to help <PER>Harry</PER> now <PER>Harry</PER>’s on the right track again” “What are you talking about?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding scared.
“D’you mean did you just see You-Know- Who?” “I was <PER>Voldemort</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands in the darkness and held them up to <PER>Harry</PER>'s face to check that them were no longer deathly white and long-fingered.
“But — <PER>Harry</PER>, that’s got to be — ” “The weapon,” <PER>Harry</PER> finished the sentence for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs back into bed.
“Did you say,” murmured <PER>Ron</PER>, putting his head close to <PER>Harry</PER>’s on the pretense of helping himself to water from the jug on himself's bedside table, “that you were You- Know-Who?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw it spill over <PER>Harry</PER>'s chin onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off their robes, and talking, “you’ve got to tell — ” “I haven’t got to tell anyone,” said <PER>Harry</PER> shortly.
He got back into bed and rolled over onto He's side with He's back to <PER>Ron</PER> and after a while He heard <PER>Ron</PER>’s mattress creak as <PER>Ron</PER>’s lay back down too.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s scar began to burn; <PER>Ron</PER>’s bit hard on <PER>Ron</PER>’s's pillow to stop <PER>Ron</PER>’s making a noise.
Somewhere, he knew, Avery was being punished <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> waited until break next morning to tell <PER>Hermione</PER> exactly what had happened.
Standing in They's usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard, <PER>Harry</PER> told her every detail of the dream <PER>Harry</PER> could remember.
“And now Rookwood’s told <PER>Voldemort</PER> how to get the weapon?” “I didn’t hear all the conversation, but that’s what it sounded like,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Rookwood used to work there Maybe <PER>Voldemort</PER>’ll send Rookwood to do it?” <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded, apparently still lost in thought.
Then, quite abruptly, <PER>Hermione</PER> said, “But you shouldn’t have seen this at all, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “What?” he said, taken aback.
“And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on.” <PER>Harry</PER> was so angry with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s that <PER>Harry</PER> did not talk to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s for the rest of the day, which proved to be another bad one.
The week did not improve as it progressed: <PER>Harry</PER> received two more D’s in Potions, was still on tenterhooks that <PER>Hagrid</PER> might get the sack, and could not stop <PER>Harry</PER> from dwelling on the dream in which <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Voldemort</PER>, though <PER>Harry</PER> did not bring it up with <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> again because <PER>Harry</PER> did not want another telling-off from <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> wished very much that <PER>Harry</PER> could have talked to Sirius about it, but that was out of the question, so <PER>Harry</PER> tried to push the matter to the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind.
“Get up, Potter.” A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, <PER>Harry</PER> was to be found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of <PER>Snape</PER>’s office, trying to clear <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very early memories <PER>Harry</PER> had not even realized <PER>Harry</PER> still had, most of them concerning humiliations <PER>Dudley</PER> and He's gang had inflicted upon him in primary school.
“What was it?” “I don’t know,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, getting wearily to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s dark eyes bored into <PER>Harry</PER>’s.
Remembering what <PER>Snape</PER> had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, <PER>Harry</PER> blinked and looked away.
“It — ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, looking everywhere but at <PER>Snape</PER>, “it was — just a dream I had.” “A dream,” repeated <PER>Snape</PER>.
“That is just as well, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, “because you are neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what <PER>Voldemort</PER> is saying to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s Death Eaters.” “No — that’s your job, isn’t it?” <PER>Harry</PER> shot at him.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not meant to say it; it had burst out of <PER>Harry</PER> in temper.
For a long moment they stared at each other, <PER>Harry</PER> convinced <PER>Harry</PER> had gone too far.
But there was a curious, almost satisfied expression on <PER>Snape</PER>’s face when <PER>Snape</PER> answered.
“Yes, Potter,” <PER>Snape</PER> said, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyes glinting.
“One — two — three — LegilimensV’ A hundred dementors were swooping toward <PER>Harry</PER> across the lake in the grounds <PER>Harry</PER> screwed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s face in concentration They were coming closer <PER>Harry</PER> could see the dark holes beneath They's hoods yet <PER>Harry</PER> could also see <PER>Snape</PER> standing in front of <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes fixed upon <PER>Harry</PER>’s face, muttering under <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath And somehow, <PER>Snape</PER> was growing clearer, and the dementors were growing fainter <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand.
One of the jars behind <PER>Harry</PER> had broken when <PER>Harry</PER> fell against the jars behind <PER>Harry</PER>; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in the jars behind him draining potion.
“Well, Potter that was certainly an improvement” Panting slightly, <PER>Snape</PER> straightened the Pensieve in which <PER>Snape</PER> had again stored some of <PER>Snape</PER>'s thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though checking that they were still there.
“I don’t remember telling you to use a Shield Charm but there is no doubt that it was effective” <PER>Harry</PER> did not speak; <PER>Harry</PER> felt that to say anything might be dangerous.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> had just broken into <PER>Snape</PER>’s memories, that <PER>Harry</PER> had just seen scenes from <PER>Snape</PER>’s childhood, and it was unnerving to think that the crying little boy who had watched <PER>Harry</PER>'s parents shouting was actually standing in front of <PER>Harry</PER> with such loathing in <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes “Let’s try again, shall we?” said <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a thrill of dread: <PER>Harry</PER> was about to pay for what had just happened, <PER>Harry</PER> was sure of it.
They moved back into position with the desk between They, <PER>Harry</PER> feeling <PER>Harry</PER> was going to find it much harder to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind this time “On the count of three, then,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, raising his wand once more.
“One — two — ” <PER>Harry</PER> did not have time to gather <PER>Harry</PER> together and attempt to clear <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind, for <PER>Snape</PER> had already cried “ Legilimens\” Legilimens\ was hurtling along the corridor toward the Department of Mysteries, past the blank stone walls, past the torches — the plain black door was growing ever larger; Legilimens\ was moving so fast Legilimens\ was going to collide with Legilimens\, Legilimens\ was feet from Legilimens\ and Legilimens\ could see that chink of faint blue light again — the plain black door had flown open!
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
<PER>Harry</PER> was flat on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back again with no memory of having gotten there; <PER>Harry</PER> was also panting as though <PER>Harry</PER> really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor, really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room “Explain yourself!” said <PER>Snape</PER>, who was standing over him, looking furious.
There was a lump on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head from where <PER>Harry</PER> had hit the ground and <PER>Harry</PER> felt feverish.
“You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that <PER>Voldemort</PER> — ” “Can you tell me something, sir?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, firing up again.
“Why do you call <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER>, I’ve only ever heard Death Eaters call <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER> that — ” <PER>Snape</PER> opened <PER>Snape</PER>'s mouth in a snarl — and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s head jerked upward; <PER>Snape</PER>’s was gazing at the ceiling.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear a muffled commotion coming from what <PER>Harry</PER> thought might be the entrance hall.
<PER>Snape</PER> looked around at <PER>Snape</PER>, frowning.
“Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter?” <PER>Harry</PER> shook <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Snape</PER> strode to <PER>Snape</PER>'s office door, his wand still held at the ready, and swept out of sight.
When <PER>Harry</PER> reached the top <PER>Harry</PER> found the entrance hall packed.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was directly opposite <PER>Harry</PER> on the other side of the hall; Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> looked as though what Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> was watching made Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s feel faintly sick.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard a sob to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left and looked around.
“There, there, Sibyll Calm down Blow your nose on this It’s not as bad as you think, now You are not going to have to leave Hogwarts” “Oh really, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> in a deadly voice, taking a few steps forward.
“Yours, Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> with a singularly unpleasant little laugh.
“Might I ask you to escort Sibyll back upstairs, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>?” “Of course,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“This is Firenze,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> happily to a thunderstruck <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“Not really,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet “I’ve never really liked horses.” <PER>Hermione</PER> turned a page of the newspaper, scanning its columns.
“She can’t get any worse than She’s been already.” “You mark my words, She’s going to want revenge on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for appointing a new teacher without consulting her,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, closing the newspaper.
When <PER>Harry</PER> entered it right behind <PER>Ron</PER>, and found himself right in the middle of a forest clearing, <PER>Harry</PER> was therefore momentarily stunned.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter,” he said, holding out a hand when <PER>Harry</PER> entered.
“Er — hi,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking hands with the centaur, who surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile.
As <PER>Harry</PER> turned to join the rest of the class upon the floor, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they were all looking at <PER>Harry</PER> with awe, apparently deeply impressed that <PER>Harry</PER> was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom they seemed to find intimidating.
“They see this as a betrayal of our kind.” <PER>Harry</PER> remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing <PER>Harry</PER> to ride to safety upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, calling <PER>Harry</PER> a “common mule.” <PER>Harry</PER> wondered whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest.
“And is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind.” <PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head very slightly to look at Parvati.
“Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,” continued Firenze, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard the swishing of <PER>Harry</PER>'s tail again as <PER>Harry</PER> walked up and down before them, “but she wastes shis time, in the main, on the self- P a g e ?
“I mean, I could do with a few more details about this war we’re about to have, couldn’t you?” The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped; <PER>Harry</PER> had completely forgotten that they were still inside the castle, quite convinced that <PER>Harry</PER> was really in the forest.
The class filed out, looking slightly perplexed; <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were on the point of following them when Firenze called, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, a word, please.” <PER>Harry</PER> turned.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, you are a friend of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s, are you not?” said the centaur.
“I would warn <PER>Hagrid</PER> myself, but I am banished — it would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now — <PER>Hagrid</PER> has troubles enough, without a centaurs’ battle.” “But — what’s <PER>Hagrid</PER> attempting to do?” said <PER>Harry</PER> nervously.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze’s warning to <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Because you’ve got to be careful, <PER>Umbridge</PER> has already sacked Trelawney and if you ask me, <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s on a roll.
“Don’ worry abou’ me, <PER>Harry</PER>, jus’ get along now, there’s a good lad” <PER>Harry</PER> had no choice but to leave <PER>Hagrid</PER> mopping up the dung all over <PER>Harry</PER>'s floor, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt thoroughly dispirited as <PER>Harry</PER> trudged back up to the castle.
lessons, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> would have been extremely unhappy.
<PER>Harry</PER> sometimes felt that <PER>Harry</PER> was living for the hours <PER>Harry</PER> spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but thoroughly enjoying <PER>Harry</PER> at the same time, swelling with pride as <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>'s fellow D.A.
Indeed, <PER>Harry</PER> sometimes wondered how <PER>Umbridge</PER> was going to react when all the members of the D.A.
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said <PER>Cho</PER> brightly, watching <PER>Cho</PER>'s silvery swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last lesson before Easter.
<PER>Neville</PER> face was screwed up in concentration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from <PER>Neville</PER>'s wand tip.
“You’ve got to think of something happy,” <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m trying,” said <PER>Neville</PER> miserably, who was trying so hard <PER>Neville</PER>'s round face was actually shining with sweat.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been brought along to <PER>Harry</PER>'s first ever D.A.
“Look — ah — it’s gone But it was definitely something hairy, <PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER>’s Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gamboling around her.
Next thing <PER>Harry</PER> knew, something was tugging at <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes somewhere near the knee.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked down and saw, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s very great astonishment, Dobby the house-elf peering up at <PER>Harry</PER> from beneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual eight hats.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir ” squeaked the elf, trembling from head to foot, “<PER>Harry</PER> Potter, sir Dobby has come to warn you but the house-elves have been warned not to tell ” sir Dobby ran headfirst at the wall: <PER>Harry</PER>, who had some experience of Dobby’s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by him's eight hats.
“What’s happened, Dobby?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, grabbing the elf’s tiny arm and holding <PER>Harry</PER> away from anything with which <PER>Harry</PER> might seek to hurt <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> Potter she she ” Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with himself's free fist: <PER>Harry</PER> seized that too.
“<PER>Umbridge</PER>?” asked <PER>Harry</PER>, horrified.
Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off <PER>Harry</PER>’s knees; <PER>Harry</PER> held him at bay.
His hands held fast by <PER>Harry</PER>, the elf tried to kick <PER>Harry</PER> and fell to the floor.
“Yes, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, yes!” <PER>Harry</PER> straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf.
It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer — “<PER>Harry</PER>, come on!” shrieked <PER>Hermione</PER> from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out.
“Thank you, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and <PER>Harry</PER> Potter!
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast that <PER>Harry</PER> caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> started to run right; there was a boys’ bathroom up ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> could pretend He’d been in there all the time if <PER>Harry</PER> could just reach it — Something caught him around the ankles and him fell spectacularly, skidding along on him's front for six feet before coming to a halt.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought of <PER>Ron</PER> — Molly would kill him — and of how <PER>Hermione</PER> would feel if <PER>Hermione</PER> was expelled before <PER>Hermione</PER> could take <PER>Hermione</PER>'s O.W.L.s.
And it had been Seamus’s very first meeting and <PER>Neville</PER> had been getting so good “Fizzing Whizbee,” sang <PER>Umbridge</PER>, and the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split open, and they ascended the moving stone staircase.
they reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but <PER>Umbridge</PER> did not bother to knock, <PER>Umbridge</PER> strode straight inside, still holding tight to <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was sitting behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s expression serene, the tips of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long fingers together.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> stood rigidly beside Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s face extremely tense.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Harry</PER> free of <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s grasp as the door swung shut behind them.
<PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge was glaring at <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge with a kind of vicious satisfaction upon <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge's face.
“Well, well, well ” <PER>Harry</PER> replied with the dirtiest look <PER>Harry</PER> could muster.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart drummed madly inside <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain was oddly cool and clear.
“The <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy cornered him.” “Did The <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy, did The <PER>Malfoy</PER> boy?” said Fudge appreciatively.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was not looking directly at <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes were fixed upon a point just over <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s shoulder, but as <PER>Harry</PER> stared at him, him shook him's head a fraction of an inch to each side.
Fudge looked incredulously from <PER>Harry</PER> to Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> took advantage of <PER>Harry</PER>'s momentary inattention to steal another quick look at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink.
“So it’s news to you, is it,” said Fudge, his voice now thick with anger, “that an illegal student organization has been discovered within this school?” “Yes, it is,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“I think, Minister,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> silkily from beside <PER>Harry</PER>, “we might make better progress if I fetch we informant.” “Yes, yes, do,” said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as <PER>Umbridge</PER> left the room.
“There’s nothing like a good witness, is there, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “Nothing at all, <PER>Cornelius</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> gravely, inclining his head.
There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then <PER>Harry</PER> heard the door open behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> moved past <PER>Harry</PER> into the room, gripping by the shoulder <PER>Cho</PER>’s curly-haired friend Marietta, who was hiding <PER>Cho</PER>'s face in <PER>Cho</PER>'s hands.
“So she can speak freely?” “I have not yet managed to find one,” <PER>Umbridge</PER> admitted grudgingly, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt a surge of pride in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s jinxing ability.
“The purpose of Potter’s meeting with these students,” continued Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, “was to persuade these students to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses The Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age — ” “I think you 11 find you’re wrong there, Dolores,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> quietly, peering at Dolores's over the half- moon spectacles perched halfway down <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s crooked nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not see how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was going to talk <PER>Dumbledore</PER> out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word <PER>Harry</PER> said in the Hog’s Head there was simply no escaping it.
“Oh, very good, Minister, very good!” <PER>Harry</PER> could have kicked <PER>Harry</PER>.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> saw, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s astonishment, that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was smiling gently too.
“<PER>Cornelius</PER>, I do not deny — and nor, I am sure, does <PER>Harry</PER> — that <PER>Harry</PER> was in the Hog’s Head that day, nor that <PER>Harry</PER> was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group.
This was it, these meetings had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would be able to shift aside “Just nod or shake your head, dear,” <PER>Umbridge</PER> said coaxingly to Marietta.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’sArmy.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> gazed at the heading scribbled by <PER>Hermione</PER> months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak.
“Would you like a written confession from me, <PER>Cornelius</PER> — or will a statement before these witnesses suffice?” <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>McGonagall</PER> and Kingsley look at each other.
“What — I don’t — ?” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Army, <PER>Cornelius</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge’s face.
Kingsley flashed a look of warning at Kingsley, <PER>McGonagall</PER> widened her eyes threateningly, but it had suddenly dawned upon <PER>Harry</PER> what <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was about to do, and Kingsley could not let it happen.
“No — Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “Be quiet, <PER>Harry</PER>, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,” said — Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
“I see no snag, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” “Well,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> apologetically, “I’m afraid I do.” “Oh really?” “Well — it’s just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to — what is the phrase?
Fudge stared at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with a very silly expression on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face, as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand drift, almost casually, toward <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket.
“So,” sneered Fudge, recovering himself, “you intend to take on Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, and myself single-handed, do you, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “Merlin’s beard, no,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, smiling.
A hand grabbed the scruff of <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck and forced <PER>Harry</PER> down on the floor as a second silver flash went off — several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes screeched, and a cloud of dust filled the air.
Coughing in the dust, <PER>Harry</PER> saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> struggled around to see who was half- strangling <PER>Harry</PER> and saw Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> crouched beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes!” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, getting up and dragging <PER>Harry</PER> and Marietta with her.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> seized <PER>Harry</PER>’s wrist.
“Remember — close your mind — ” But as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s fingers closed over <PER>Harry</PER>’s skin, a pain shot through the scar on <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt again that terrible, snakelike longing to strike <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, to bite him, to hurt <PER>Harry</PER> — “ — you will understand,” whispered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> released <PER>Harry</PER>, raised his hand, and grasped the phoenix’s long golden tail.
“Well, Minerva,” said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirtsleeve, “I’m afraid this is the end of your friend <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “You think so, do you?” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> scornfully.
“You’d better get those two off to bed,” said Fudge, looking back at Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> with a dismissive nod toward <PER>Harry</PER> and Marietta.
“You know, Minister, I disagree with <PER>Dumbledore</PER> on many counts but you cannot deny <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s got style” Dolores Jane <PER>Umbridge</PER> (High Inquisitor) has replaced Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER> as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Signed: <PER>Cornelius</PER> Oswald Fudge The notices had gone up all over the school overnight, but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the Minister of Magic, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s Junior Assistant to escape.
No matter where <PER>Harry</PER> went within the castle next day, the sole topic of conversation was <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s flight, and though some of the details might have gone awry in the retelling (<PER>Harry</PER> overheard one second-year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St. Mungo’s with a pumpkin for a head), it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was.
Everybody seemed aware, for instance, that <PER>Harry</PER> and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office, and as Marietta was now in the hospital wing, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> besieged with requests to give a firsthand account wherever <PER>Harry</PER> went.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> will be back before long,” said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology after listening intently to <PER>Harry</PER>’s story.
“Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid puffed-up, power-crazy old — ” “Now, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger?” <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had slid out from behind the door, followed by Crabbe and Goyle.
“He can’t be allowed to dock points that would be ridiculous It would completely undermine the prefect system” But <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had turned automatically toward the giant hourglasses set in niches along the wall behind them, which recorded the House points.
He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and Ernie in front of the hourglasses.
“<PER>Malfoy</PER> just docked us all about fifty points,” said <PER>Harry</PER> furiously, as they watched several more stones fly upward from the Gryffindor hourglass.
“Just in case ” “Yeah, all right,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and the three of them moved toward the doors to the Great Hall, but <PER>Harry</PER> had barely glimpsed today’s ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped <PER>Harry</PER> on the shoulder and, turning, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> almost nose to nose with Filch, the caretaker.
“Follow me” <PER>Harry</PER> glanced back at <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were both looking worried.
“Here we are,” he said, leering down at <PER>Harry</PER> as he rapped three times upon Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s door and pushed it open.
“The Potter boy to see you, ma’am.” <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office, so very familiar to <PER>Harry</PER> from <PER>Harry</PER>'s many detentions, was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word HEADMISTRESS; also his Firebolt, and Fred’s and George’s Clean-sweeps, which he saw with a pang were now chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> was sitting behind the desk, busily scribbling upon some of <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s pink parchment, but looked up and smiled widely at their entrance.
“Sit,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> curtly, pointing toward a chair, and <PER>Harry</PER> sat.
“What would you like to drink?” “What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, quite sure <PER>Harry</PER> had misheard her.
“<PER>Cho</PER>ose one.” “Fine tea then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shrugging.
One of the horrible painted kittens behind <PER>Umbridge</PER> had great round blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moody’s magical one, and it had just occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> what Mad-Eye would say if <PER>Harry</PER> ever heard that <PER>Harry</PER> had drunk anything offered by a known enemy.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised the cup to <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips again and pretended to take a sip, though keeping <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth tightly closed.
“Where is Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” “No idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER> promptly.
“In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.” <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach turned over and <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand holding the teacup shook so that the cup rattled in its saucer.
<PER>Harry</PER> tilted the cup to <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth with <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid trickled down onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Haven’t got a clue.” They stared at each other so long that <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes watering.
“What was — ?” She was gazing toward the door; <PER>Harry</PER> took the opportunity to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s almost full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers.
“Back to lunch with you, Potter!” cried <PER>Umbridge</PER>, raising <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s wand and dashing out of the office.
Firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere <PER>Harry</PER> looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight, or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer <PER>Harry</PER> watched.
As <PER>Harry</PER> watched, one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to maneuver; it whirled toward <PER>Umbridge</PER> and Filch with a sinister voheeeeeeeeee.
Laughing, <PER>Harry</PER> ducked down low, ran to a door <PER>Harry</PER> knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just behind it, listening to <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s and Filch’s yells and quaking with suppressed mirth.
“Miss Brown, would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing the headmistress's that we have an escaped firework in our classroom?” The upshot of it all was that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> spent Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid none of whom's rooms of the fireworks without her.
When the final bell rang and the students were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with the students's bags, <PER>Harry</PER> saw, with immense satisfaction, a disheveled and soot- blackened <PER>Umbridge</PER> tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick’s classroom.
Even <PER>Hermione</PER> fought Even <PER>Hermione</PER>'s way through the excited crowd around them to congratulate them.
“If you want to add your name to the waiting list, <PER>Hermione</PER>, it’s five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty for the Deflagration Deluxe” <PER>Hermione</PER> returned to the table where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework might spring out of it and start doing itself.
“Now you mention it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> happily, “d’you know I think I’m feeling a bit rebellious.” <PER>Harry</PER> could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> went up to bed an hour later, and as <PER>Harry</PER> got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word POO.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> got into bed, yawning.
With <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>'s glasses off, the occasional fire-work still passing the window became blurred, looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky.
He turned onto He's side, wondering how <PER>Umbridge</PER> was feeling about <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s first day in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s job, and how Fudge would react when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption Smiling to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> closed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant or perhaps he, <PER>Harry</PER>, was simply speeding away from them he had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries.
“I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and it’s like they mated, come and see!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look.
<PER>Harry</PER> lay quite still and silent while the pain in <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar subsided and disappointment washed over <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from <PER>Harry</PER> at the very last moment <PER>Harry</PER> had got so close that time Glittering, pink-and-silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower.
<PER>Harry</PER> stomach gave a sickening jolt as <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> had Occlumency the following evening <PER>Harry</PER> spent the whole of the next day dreading what <PER>Snape</PER> was going to say if <PER>Harry</PER> found out how much farther into the Department of Mysteries His had penetrated during <PER>Harry</PER>'s last dream.
With a surge of guilt <PER>Harry</PER> realized that <PER>Harry</PER> had not practiced Occlumency once since their last lesson: There had been too much going on since <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had left.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure <PER>Harry</PER> would not have been able to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind even if <PER>Harry</PER> had tried.
<PER>Harry</PER> doubted, however, whether <PER>Snape</PER> would accept that excuse <PER>Harry</PER> attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good, <PER>Hermione</PER> kept asking <PER>Harry</PER> what was wrong whenever <PER>Harry</PER> fell silent trying to rid <PER>Harry</PER> of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain was not while teachers were firing review questions at the class.
Halfway across the entrance hall, however, <PER>Cho</PER> came hurrying up to <PER>Cho</PER>.
“Over here,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with <PER>Snape</PER> and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall where the giant hourglasses stood.
“No, it was only Well, I just wanted to say <PER>Harry</PER>, I never dreamed Marietta would tell” “Yeah, well,” said <PER>Harry</PER> moodily.
<PER>Harry</PER> did feel <PER>Cho</PER> might have chosen <PER>Cho</PER>'s friends a bit more carefully.
“You know, her mum works for the Ministry, it’s really difficult for her — ” “<PER>Ron</PER>’s dad works for the Ministry too!” <PER>Harry</PER> said furiously.
“And in case you hadn’t noticed, <PER>Harry</PER> hasn’t got ‘sneak’ written across <PER>Harry</PER>'s face — ” “That was a really horrible trick of <PER>Hermione</PER> Granger’s,” said <PER>Cho</PER> fiercely.
“<PER>Cho</PER> should have told us she’d jinxed that list — ” “I think it was a brilliant idea,” said <PER>Harry</PER> coldly.
<PER>Cho</PER> flushed and <PER>Cho</PER>'s eyes grew brighter.
“Oh yes, I forgot — of course, if it was darling <PER>Hermione</PER>’s idea — ” “Don’t start crying again,” said <PER>Harry</PER> warningly.
Fuming, <PER>Harry</PER> descended the stairs to <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, and though <PER>Harry</PER> knew from experience how much easier it would be for <PER>Snape</PER> to penetrate <PER>Snape</PER>'s mind if <PER>Snape</PER> arrived angry and resentful, <PER>Snape</PER> succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more good things <PER>Snape</PER> should have said to <PER>Cho</PER> about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door.
“You’re late, Potter,” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly, as <PER>Harry</PER> closed the door behind him.
<PER>Snape</PER> was standing with <PER>Snape</PER>'s back to <PER>Harry</PER>, removing, as usual, certain of <PER>Harry</PER>'s thoughts and placing them carefully in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s Pensieve.
“Have you been practicing?” “Yes,” <PER>Harry</PER> lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk.
“Wand out, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> moved into <PER>Harry</PER>'s usual position, facing <PER>Snape</PER> with the desk between them.
<PER>Harry</PER> heart was pumping fast with anger at <PER>Cho</PER> and anxiety about how much <PER>Snape</PER> was about to extract from <PER>Snape</PER>'s mind.
“One — two — ” <PER>Snape</PER>’s office door banged open and <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> sped in.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, sir — oh — sorry — ” <PER>Malfoy</PER> was looking at <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> in some surprise.
“It’s all right, <PER>Draco</PER>,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, lowering his wand.
“Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions.” <PER>Harry</PER> had not seen <PER>Malfoy</PER> look so gleeful since <PER>Umbridge</PER> had turned up to inspect <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“I didn’t know,” <PER>Harry</PER> said, leering at <PER>Harry</PER>, who knew his face was burning.
“Well, <PER>Draco</PER>, what is it?” asked <PER>Snape</PER>.
“It’s Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, sir — she needs your help,” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> mouthed “Remedial Potions?” at <PER>Harry</PER> behind <PER>Snape</PER> ’s back before following <PER>Harry</PER> behind <PER>Snape</PER> ’s.
<PER>Snape</PER>’s thoughts things he did not want <PER>Harry</PER> to see if he broke through <PER>Snape</PER>’s defenses accidentally <PER>Harry</PER> gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside <PER>Harry</PER> What was it that <PER>Snape</PER> was so keen to hide from <PER>Harry</PER>?
Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that <PER>Snape</PER> was determined to keep from <PER>Snape</PER>?
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart now pumping harder and faster than ever.
Would <PER>Snape</PER> come straight back to <PER>Snape</PER>'s office afterward, or accompany Montague to the hospital wing?
Surely Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, <PER>Snape</PER> would want to make sure <PER>Snape</PER> was all right <PER>Harry</PER> walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over the Pensieve, gazing into the Pensieve depths.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, listening, then pulled out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand again.
<PER>Harry</PER> was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling In fact, unless <PER>Harry</PER> was much mistaken, <PER>Harry</PER> was looking down upon the Great Hall He breath was actually fogging the surface of <PER>Snape</PER>’s thoughts <PER>Snape</PER> brain seemed to be in limbo It would be insane to do the thing that <PER>Harry</PER> was so strongly tempted to do <PER>Harry</PER> was trembling <PER>Snape</PER> could be back at any moment but <PER>Harry</PER> thought of <PER>Cho</PER>’s anger, of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> took a great gulp of breath and plunged <PER>Harry</PER>'s face into the surface of <PER>Snape</PER>’s thoughts.
At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping <PER>Harry</PER> headfirst into <PER>Harry</PER> was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as <PER>Harry</PER> went, and then — <PER>Harry</PER> was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four House tables were gone.
<PER>Snape</PER> had to be here somewhere This was <PER>Snape</PER>'s memory And there <PER>Snape</PER> was, at a table right behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Snape</PER>-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about <PER>Snape</PER>-the-teenager, like a plant kept in the dark.
<PER>Harry</PER> moved around behind <PER>Snape</PER> and read the heading of the examination paper: So <PER>Snape</PER> had to be fifteen or sixteen, around <PER>Harry</PER>’s own age.
<PER>Harry</PER> hand was flying across the parchment; <PER>Harry</PER> had written at least a foot more than <PER>Harry</PER>'s closest neighbors, and yet <PER>Harry</PER>'s writing was minuscule and cramped.
“Five more minutes!” The voice made <PER>Harry</PER> jump; turning, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the top of Professor Flitwick’s head moving between the desks a short distance away.
Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair very untidy black hair <PER>Harry</PER> moved so quickly that, had <PER>Harry</PER> been solid, <PER>Harry</PER> would have knocked desks flying.
The back of the black-haired boy’s head drew nearer and nearer the black-haired boy’s was straightening up now, putting down the black-haired boy’s's quill, pulling the black-haired boy’s's roll of parchment toward the black-haired boy’s so as to reread what the black-haired boy’s had written <PER>Harry</PER> stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s fifteen-year- old father.
James’s hair stuck up at the back exactly as <PER>Harry</PER>’s did, his hands could have been <PER>Harry</PER>’s, and <PER>Harry</PER> could tell that when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other’s heights.
Sirius was lounging in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chair at <PER>Harry</PER>'s ease, tilting it back on two legs.
He was very good-looking; He's dark hair fell into He's eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James’s nor <PER>Harry</PER>’s could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind <PER>Harry</PER> was eyeing <PER>Harry</PER> hopefully, though <PER>Harry</PER> didn’t seem to have noticed.
and was absorbed in the exam: As <PER>Harry</PER> reread <PER>Harry</PER>'s answers <PER>Harry</PER> scratched <PER>Harry</PER>'s chin with the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill, frowning slightly.
“Very well, everybody, you’re free to go!” <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s father, who had hastily crossed out the L. E. <PER>Harry</PER> had been embellishing, jumped to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet, stuffed <PER>Harry</PER>'s quill and the exam question paper into <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, which <PER>Harry</PER> slung over <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join his.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and glimpsed <PER>Snape</PER> a short way away, moving between the tables toward the doors into the entrance hall, still absorbed in <PER>Harry</PER>'s own examination paper.
Round-shouldered yet angular, <PER>Harry</PER> walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, <PER>Harry</PER>'s oily hair swinging about <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
A gang of chattering girls separated <PER>Snape</PER> from James and Sirius, and by planting <PER>Harry</PER> in the midst of this group, <PER>Harry</PER> managed to keep <PER>Snape</PER> in sight while straining <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears to catch the voices of James and his friends.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked anxiously behind <PER>Harry</PER> again.
<PER>Snape</PER> remained close by, still buried in <PER>Harry</PER>'s examination questions; but this was <PER>Snape</PER>’s memory, and <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that if <PER>Snape</PER> chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, he, <PER>Harry</PER>, would not be able to follow James any farther.
To James's intense relief, however, when James and James's three friends strode off down the lawn toward the lake, <PER>Snape</PER> followed, still poring over the paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where <PER>Snape</PER> was going.
They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> had spent a Sunday finishing <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>'s homework, and threw They down on the grass.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder yet again and saw, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s delight, that <PER>Snape</PER> had settled <PER>Harry</PER> on the grass in the dense shadows of a clump of bushes.
<PER>Harry</PER> noticed <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had a habit of rumpling up <PER>Harry</PER>'s hair as though to make sure it did not get too tidy, and also that <PER>Harry</PER> kept looking over at the girls by the water’s edge.
<PER>Snape</PER> was on <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet again, and was stowing the O.W.L.
Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to <PER>Snape</PER> with a look of avid anticipation on <PER>Snape</PER>'s face.
<PER>Snape</PER> reacted so fast it was as though <PER>Snape</PER> had been expecting an attack: Dropping <PER>Snape</PER>'s bag, <PER>Snape</PER> plunged <PER>Snape</PER>'s hand inside <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes, and <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, “ ExpelliarmusV’ <PER>Snape</PER> ’s wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him.
<PER>Snape</PER> was trying to get up, but the jinx was still operating on <PER>Snape</PER>; <PER>Snape</PER> was struggling, as though bound by invisible ropes.
“What’re you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?” <PER>Snape</PER> let out a stream of mixed swearwords and hexes, but <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand being ten feet away nothing happened.
<PER>Snape</PER> was beginning to inch toward <PER>Snape</PER>'s fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as <PER>Snape</PER> crawled.
“OY!” But too late; <PER>Snape</PER> had directed <PER>Snape</PER>'s wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James’s face, spattering his robes with blood.
Disentangling <PER>Snape</PER> from <PER>Snape</PER>'s robes, <PER>Snape</PER> got quickly to <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet, wand up, but Sirius said, “Petrificus Totalusl” and <PER>Snape</PER> keeled over again at once, rigid as a board.
“There you go,” James said, as <PER>Snape</PER> struggled to <PER>Snape</PER>'s feet again, “you’re lucky Evans was here, Snivellus — ” “I don’t need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!” Lily blinked.
Wincing, <PER>Harry</PER> looked around to see who had hold of <PER>Harry</PER>, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized <PER>Snape</PER> standing right beside him, white with rage.
“Having fun?” <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> rising into the air.
The summer’s day evaporated around <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was floating upward through icy blackness, <PER>Snape</PER>’s hand still tight upon <PER>Harry</PER>'s upper arm.
Then, with a swooping feeling as though <PER>Harry</PER> had turned head over heels in midair, <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet hit the stone floor of <PER>Snape</PER>’s dungeon, and <PER>Harry</PER> was standing again beside the Pensieve on <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master’s study.
“So,” said <PER>Snape</PER>, gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so tightly <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand was starting to feel numb.
“So been enjoying yourself, Potter?” “N-no ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to free <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm.
It was scary: <PER>Snape</PER>’s lips were shaking, <PER>Snape</PER>'s face was white, <PER>Snape</PER>'s teeth were bared.
“Amusing man, your father, wasn’t he?” said <PER>Snape</PER>, shaking <PER>Harry</PER> so hard that <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses slipped down <PER>Harry</PER>'s nose.
“I — didn’t — ” <PER>Snape</PER> threw <PER>Harry</PER> from <PER>Snape</PER> with all his might.
“No,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, getting to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet as far from <PER>Snape</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> could.
“No, of course I w — ” “Get out, get out, I don’t want to see you in this office ever again!” And as <PER>Harry</PER> hurtled toward the door, ajar of dead cockroaches exploded over <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor to tell <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> what He had just seen.
What was making <PER>Harry</PER> feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at <PER>Harry</PER> — it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how <PER>Snape</PER> had felt as <PER>Snape</PER>'s father had taunted him, and that judging from what him had just seen, him's father had been every bit as arrogant as <PER>Snape</PER> had always told <PER>Snape</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> reckons I can carry on by myself now I’ve got the basics” “So you’ve stopped having funny dreams?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> skeptically.
“Well, I don’t think <PER>Snape</PER> should stop until you’re absolutely sure you can control them!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> indignantly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I think you should go back to <PER>Harry</PER> and ask — ” “No,” said <PER>Harry</PER> forcefully.
“Just drop it, <PER>Hermione</PER>, okay?” It was the first day of the Easter holidays and <PER>Hermione</PER>, as was her custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedules for the three of them.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had let her do it — it was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.
“How can that come as a shock?” <PER>Hermione</PER> demanded, as <PER>Hermione</PER> tapped each little square on <PER>Ron</PER>’s schedule with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand so that it flashed a different color according to it subject.
“I dunno ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, “there’s been a lot going on” “Well, there you are,” she said, handing him him's schedule, “if you follow that you should do fine.” <PER>Ron</PER> looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was looking at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.
“I saw <PER>Cho</PER> earlier,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively, “and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked really miserable too Have you two had a row again?” “Wha — oh yeah, we have,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, seizing gratefully on the excuse.
“If it hadn’t been for her ” <PER>Ron</PER> went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which <PER>Harry</PER> found helpful.
Hadn’t people like <PER>Hagrid</PER> and Sirius told <PER>Harry</PER> how wonderful <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had been?
( Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head <PER>Harry</PER> was as bad, wasn’t <PER>Harry</PER>?)
Yes, he had once overheard Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and <PER>Harry</PER> could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside down for the fun of it not unless them really loathed them Perhaps <PER>Malfoy</PER>, or somebody who really deserved it <PER>Harry</PER> tried to make a case for <PER>Snape</PER> having deserved what <PER>Harry</PER> had suffered at James’s hands — but hadn’t Lily asked, “What’s he done to you?” And hadn’t James replied, “It’s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean?” Hadn’t James started it all simply because Sirius said James was bored?
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had made <PER>Harry</PER> prefect in the hope that <PER>Harry</PER> would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius But in the Pensieve, <PER>Harry</PER> had sat there and let it all happen <PER>Harry</PER> reminded <PER>Harry</PER> that Lily had intervened; <PER>Harry</PER>'s mother had been decent, yet the memory of the look on Lily's face as Lily had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else.
She had clearly loathed James and <PER>Harry</PER> simply could not understand how James and <PER>Harry</PER> could have ended up married.
<PER>Harry</PER> pretended that <PER>Harry</PER>'s bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, fellow Gryffindors's excuse went unchallenged.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m talking to <PER>Harry</PER>, can you hear me?” “Huh?” <PER>Harry</PER> looked around.
<PER>Ginny</PER> Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined <PER>Harry</PER> at the library table where <PER>Harry</PER> had been sitting alone.
It was late on Sunday evening; <PER>Hermione</PER> had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to review Ancient Runes; <PER>Ron</PER> had Quidditch practice.
“Oh hi,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER>'s books back toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Anyway a package just arrived, a package’s only just got through <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s new screening process” She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped, and there was a scribbled note across it in red ink, reading INSPECTED AND PASSED BY THE “It’s Easter eggs from Mum,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked at it for a moment, then, to <PER>Harry</PER>'s horror, felt a hard lump rise in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“Are you okay, <PER>Harry</PER>?” asked <PER>Ginny</PER> quietly.
“You know, I’m sure if you just talked to <PER>Cho</PER> ” “It’s not <PER>Cho</PER> I want to talk to,” said <PER>Harry</PER> brusquely.
“But I know I can’t.” More to give He something to do than because He really wanted any, <PER>Harry</PER> unwrapped <PER>Harry</PER>'s Easter egg, broke off a large bit, and put his Easter egg into his mouth.
“Well,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> slowly, helping <PER>Ginny</PER> to a bit of egg too, “if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it” “Come on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> hopelessly.
“With <PER>Umbridge</PER> policing the fires and reading all our mail?” “The thing about growing up with Fred and George,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> thoughtfully, “is that you sort of start thinking anything’s possible if you’ve got enough nerve.” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate — Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementors — or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside he for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful “Oh damn,” whispered <PER>Ginny</PER>, jumping to <PER>Ginny</PER>'s feet.
“Out — out And whipping out her wand, her caused <PER>Harry</PER>’s books, bag, and ink bottle to chase him and <PER>Ginny</PER> from the library, whacking him and <PER>Ginny</PER> <PER>Ginny</PER> repeatedly over the head as they ran.
“She says you need to talk to Sirius?” “What?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply, freezing with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hand halfway toward picking up MAKE A BANG AT “Yeah ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to sound casual, “yeah, I thought I’d like — ” “Don’t be so ridiculous,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, straightening up and looking at <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Hermione</PER> could not believe <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes.
“And if we’re going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that <PER>Harry</PER> can have <PER>Harry</PER>'s chat with Sirius?” “Yes, but still,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, “even if you do cause a diversion, how is <PER>Harry</PER> supposed to talk to him?” “<PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could think of no alternative; <PER>Umbridge</PER> herself had told <PER>Harry</PER> that the only fire that was not being watched was <PER>Umbridge</PER> herself's own.
“So even if she’s bewitched the door so Alohomora won’t work, which I bet she has — ” “What do you think about this?” <PER>Hermione</PER> demanded of <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> was reminded irresistibly of Mistress Weasley appealing to her husband during <PER>Harry</PER>’s first dinner in Grimmauld Place.
“If <PER>Harry</PER> wants to do it, it’s up to <PER>Harry</PER>, isn’t it?” “Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,” said Fred, clapping <PER>Ron</PER> hard on the back.
“At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy’s corridor round about five o’clock tomorrow.” <PER>Harry</PER> awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as <PER>Harry</PER> had done on the morning of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hearing at the Ministry of Magic.
It was not only the prospect of breaking into <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making <PER>Harry</PER> feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough — today also happened to be the first time <PER>Harry</PER> would be in close proximity with <PER>Snape</PER> since <PER>Snape</PER> had thrown him out of him's office, as they had Potions that day.
After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside <PER>Neville</PER>’s bed, staring out on a truly glorious morning.
Directly ahead of him, <PER>Harry</PER> could see the towering beech tree below which <PER>Harry</PER>'s father had once tormented <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to <PER>Harry</PER> that would make up for what <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in the Pensieve, but <PER>Harry</PER> was desperate to hear Sirius’s own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for He's father’s behavior Something caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
<PER>Harry</PER> squinted into the sun and saw <PER>Hagrid</PER> emerging from between the trees.
As <PER>Harry</PER> watched, <PER>Hagrid</PER> staggered to the door of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin and disappeared inside ] cabin.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so <PER>Hagrid</PER> could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire <PER>Harry</PER> turned away from the window, headed back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk, and started to dress.
With the prospect of forcing entry into <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> had never expected the day to be a restful one, but <PER>Harry</PER> had not reckoned on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s almost continual attempts to dissuade <PER>Harry</PER> from what <PER>Harry</PER> was planning to do at five o’clock.
For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that <PER>Harry</PER> tried very hard to ignore. "
and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, shell be able to guess you’ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she’ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer shis questions” “<PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a low and indignant voice, “are you going to stop telling <PER>Harry</PER> off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take notes instead?” “You take notes for a change, it won’t kill you!” By the time they reached the dungeons, neither <PER>Harry</PER> nor <PER>Ron</PER> was speaking to <PER>Hermione</PER> any longer.
Undeterred, <PER>Hermione</PER> took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all uttered under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking Seamus's cauldron for leaks.
<PER>Snape</PER>, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though <PER>Harry</PER> were invisible.
<PER>Harry</PER> was, of course, well used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernon’s favorites, and on the whole was grateful <PER>Harry</PER> had to suffer nothing worse.
In fact, compared to what <PER>Harry</PER> usually had to endure from <PER>Snape</PER> in the way of taunts and snide remarks, <PER>Harry</PER> found the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to find that when left well alone, <PER>Harry</PER> was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily.
At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked some of the potion, and took some of the potion up to <PER>Snape</PER>’s desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an he had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise; <PER>Malfoy</PER> gave a gleeful yell of laughter.
<PER>Harry</PER> potion sample lay in pieces on the floor, and <PER>Snape</PER> was watching <PER>Snape</PER> with a look of gloating pleasure.
“I’m really sorry, Potter <PER>Harry</PER>, I thought you’d finished, so I cleared up!” Potter <PER>Harry</PER> could not bring Potter <PER>Harry</PER> to answer.
When the bell rang Potter <PER>Harry</PER> hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure that Potter <PER>Harry</PER> found Potter <PER>Harry</PER> a seat between <PER>Neville</PER> and Seamus for lunch so that <PER>Hermione</PER> could not start nagging him about using <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office again.
him was in such a bad mood by the time that him got to Divination that him had quite forgotten him's career appointment with Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, remembering only when <PER>Ron</PER> asked him why him wasn’t in her office.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was sitting there, a clipboard on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s knee, a fussy little pie-frill around Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s neck, and a small, horribly smug smile on Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> sat down with <PER>Harry</PER>'s back to <PER>Umbridge</PER> and did <PER>Harry</PER>'s best to pretend <PER>Harry</PER> could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.
<PER>Harry</PER> was finding the scratching noise from behind <PER>Harry</PER> very distracting.
“Yes?” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> prompted <PER>Harry</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> ignored Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> closed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.
“May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> asked curtly, without looking at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“Oh no, thank you very much,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, with that simpering laugh <PER>Harry</PER> hated so much.
“Well, then, I am confused I’m afraid I don’t quite understand how you can give Potter false hope that — ” “False hope?” repeated Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, still refusing to look round at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“He has achieved high marks in all He's Defense Against the Dark Arts tests — ” “I’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, <PER>Harry</PER> has been achieving very poor results in <PER>Harry</PER>'s classes with me — ” “I should have made my meaning plainer,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, turning at last to look <PER>Umbridge</PER> directly in the eyes.
“<PER>Harry</PER> has achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.” Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb blowing.
Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> turned back to <PER>Harry</PER>, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s thin nostrils flared, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s eyes burning.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s fussy, simpering demeanor had given place to a hard fury that made Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s broad, flabby face look oddly sinister.
“Aha!” shrieked Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, pointing a stubby finger at <PER>McGonagall</PER>.
“Potter, that concludes our career consultation.” <PER>Harry</PER> swung <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> was still breathing as though Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had just run a race when Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.
“I hope you’ve thought better of what you were planning to do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, the moment they had opened their books to chapter thirty- four (“Non-Retaliation and Negotiation”).
“<PER>Umbridge</PER> looks like she’s in a really bad mood already” Every now and then <PER>Umbridge</PER> shot glowering looks at <PER>Harry</PER>, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking his could just imagine Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s reaction if his were caught trespassing in Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office mere hours after she had vouched for him There was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that sometime during the next summer holiday him would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene him had witnessed in the Pensieve Nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into him's stomach And then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father’s old Invisibility Cloak But the fact remained that if he were caught “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sacrificed himself to keep you in school, <PER>Harry</PER>!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, raising her book to hide her face from <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, don’t do it, please don’t do it!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not answer; <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what to do.
<PER>Ron</PER> seemed determined to give neither <PER>Harry</PER>'s opinion nor <PER>Harry</PER>'s advice.
He would not look at <PER>Harry</PER>, though when <PER>Hermione</PER> opened <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth to try dissuading <PER>Harry</PER> some more, <PER>Harry</PER> said in a low voice, “Give it a rest, okay?
<PER>Harry</PER> was halfway along the corridor outside when <PER>Harry</PER> heard the unmistakable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance.
People exiting the classrooms all around <PER>Harry</PER> were stopping in People exiting the classrooms all around <PER>Harry</PER>'s tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully Then <PER>Umbridge</PER> came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — please!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> weakly.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled off <PER>Harry</PER>'s cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what <PER>Harry</PER> was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder.
<PER>Harry</PER> crouched down in front of the empty grate, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands shaking.
<PER>Harry</PER> had never done this before, though <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> knew how it must work.
Sticking <PER>Harry</PER>'s head into the fireplace, Sticking <PER>Harry</PER> took a large pinch of powder and dropped a large pinch of powder onto the logs stacked neatly beneath Sticking <PER>Harry</PER>.
Feeling rather sick and as though he was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes to find that <PER>Harry</PER> was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment.
<PER>Harry</PER> wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire — <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s hard stone floor.
“Look, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Sirius placatingly, “James and <PER>Snape</PER> hated each other from the moment James and <PER>Snape</PER> set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can’t you?
“Did I ever tell you to lay off <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Snape</PER> said.
“Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?” “Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of us sometimes That was something” “And,” said <PER>Harry</PER> doggedly, determined to say everything that was on <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind now <PER>Harry</PER> was here, “<PER>Harry</PER> kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching <PER>Harry</PER>!” “Oh, well, <PER>Harry</PER> always made a fool of <PER>Harry</PER> whenever Lily was around,” said Sirius, shrugging.
“<PER>Harry</PER> couldn’t stop <PER>Harry</PER> showing off whenever <PER>Harry</PER> got near Lily.” “How come Lily married him?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked miserably.
“Even <PER>Snape</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I mean, James didn’t take “<PER>Snape</PER> on dates with James's and jinx him in front of James, did him?” Sirius frowned at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was still looking unconvinced.
“I just never thought I’d feel sorry for <PER>Snape</PER>.” “Now you mention it,” said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, “how did <PER>Snape</PER> react when <PER>Snape</PER> found you’d seen all this?” <PER>Snape</PER> told me <PER>Snape</PER>’d never teach me Occlumency again,” said <PER>Harry</PER> indifferently, “like that’s a big disappoint “He WHAT?” shouted Sirius, causing <PER>Harry</PER> to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes.
“<PER>Harry</PER>’s stopped giving you lessons?” “Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, surprised at what <PER>Harry</PER> considered a great overreaction.
“But it’s okay, I don’t care, it’s a bit of a relief to tell you the — ” “I’m coming up there to have a word with <PER>Snape</PER>!” said Sirius forcefully and <PER>Snape</PER> actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched <PER>Snape</PER> back down again.
“If anyone’s going to tell <PER>Snape</PER> it will be me!” anyone’s going to tell <PER>Snape</PER> it will be me!
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, first of all, you’re to go back to <PER>Snape</PER> and tell <PER>Snape</PER> that on no account is <PER>Snape</PER> to stop giving you lessons — when <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hears — ” “I can’t tell <PER>Snape</PER> that, <PER>Snape</PER>’d kill me!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, outraged.
“You didn’t see <PER>Harry</PER> when we got out of the Pensieve — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!” said Lupin sternly.
“Ah, she’s left it open” <PER>Harry</PER> dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over <PER>Harry</PER> when Filch burst into the office.
<PER>Harry</PER> leapt to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet and, making sure that <PER>Harry</PER> had <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen <PER>Harry</PER> go.
One landing down from <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office and <PER>Harry</PER> thought it was safe to become visible again; <PER>Harry</PER> pulled off the cloak, shoved it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag and hurried onward.
“So!” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> triumphantly, whom <PER>Harry</PER> realized was standing just a few stairs in front of <PER>Harry</PER>, once more looking down upon her prey.
And before <PER>Umbridge</PER> could say a word, they raised their wands and said together, “Accio BroomsV’ <PER>Harry</PER> heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance.
“Give her hell from us, Peeves.” And Peeves, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had never seen take an order from a student before, swept <PER>Harry</PER>'s belled hat from <PER>Harry</PER>'s head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.
<PER>Harry</PER> was certain that teachers like <PER>McGonagall</PER> or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George’s Wildfire Whiz- Bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch <PER>Umbridge</PER> struggle.
Filch fitted a new door and removed <PER>Harry</PER>’s Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumored, <PER>Umbridge</PER> had set an armed security troll to guard it.
In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy- snouted niffler into <PER>Umbridge</PER> ’s office, which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on <PER>Umbridge</PER> on her re-entrance, and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers.
<PER>Umbridge</PER> only had to enter <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers, or else spout blood from both nostrils.
Indeed, a week after Fred and George’s departure <PER>Harry</PER> witnessed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn <PER>Harry</PER> heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, “It unscrews the other way.” To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from Montague's sojourn in the toilet.
“Should we say something?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a worried voice, pressing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s cheek against the Charms window so that <PER>Hermione</PER> could see Mister and Mistress Montague marching inside.
“Anyway, more trouble for <PER>Umbridge</PER>, isn’t it?” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a satisfied voice.
“Reparo\” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, mending <PER>Ron</PER>’s cup with a wave of <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand.
“Why should I be worried about you?” “When Mum’s next letter finally gets through <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s screening process,” said <PER>Ron</PER> bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, “I’m going to be in deep trouble.
“How do you know?” said <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> together.
“ ’Specially if she thinks they’re receiving stolen cauldrons or something” <PER>Hermione</PER> said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but <PER>Harry</PER> had a shrewd suspicion that shis self- restraint was bound to crack before long.
<PER>Ron</PER> snorted disbelievingly and <PER>Hermione</PER> threw him a very dirty look.
“As a matter of fact, I was going to ask <PER>Harry</PER> when <PER>Harry</PER>’s going to go back to <PER>Snape</PER> and ask for Occlumency lessons again!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart sank.
Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George’s dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> had wanted to hear news of Sirius.
As <PER>Harry</PER> had not confided in them the reason <PER>Harry</PER> had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of things to tell them.
He had been regretting this ever since; <PER>Hermione</PER> would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when <PER>Harry</PER> least expected it.
“You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said now, “because <PER>Ron</PER> told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again” <PER>Harry</PER> threw <PER>Ron</PER> a furious look.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a kind of vindictive pleasure: <PER>Harry</PER> had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort.
<PER>Harry</PER> had passed through the circular room, then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres <PER>Harry</PER> had hurried straight toward row number ninety- seven, turned left, and ran along it It had probably been then that <PER>Harry</PER> had spoken aloud Just a bit farther for <PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Harry</PER>'s conscious self struggling to wake and before <PER>Harry</PER> had reached the end of the row, <PER>Harry</PER> had found <PER>Harry</PER> lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of <PER>Harry</PER>'s four-poster.
“You are trying to block your mind, aren’t you?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking beadily at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You know,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose ears were still flaming red, “if Montague doesn’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup.” “Yeah, I s’pose so,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, glad of a change of subject.
“I mean, we’ve won one, lost one — if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday — ” “Yeah, that’s right,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, losing track of what <PER>Harry</PER> was agreeing to: <PER>Cho</PER> Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I mean, I can’t get any worse, can I?” he told <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match.
“Nothing to lose now, is there?” “You know,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, “I think <PER>Ron</PER> might do better without Fred and George around.
“<PER>Cho</PER> will be playing, won’t <PER>Cho</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER>, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted.
<PER>Ron</PER> could not wish for better, and <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> hoping against hope that <PER>Ron</PER> would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of “Weasley Is Our King.” Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George had left, was commentating as usual.
Bradley Davies Chang,” he said, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as <PER>Cho</PER> walked out onto the pitch, <PER>Cho</PER>'s shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze.
<PER>Cho</PER> was not sure what <PER>Cho</PER> wanted to happen anymore, except that <PER>Cho</PER> could not stand any more rows.
“And he’s scored.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors.
Predictably, horribly, the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing: Weasley cannot save a thing, Weasley cannot block a single ring “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said a hoarse voice in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s enormous bearded face sticking between the seats; apparently <PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> had squeezed <PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Harry</PER>'s way all along the row behind, for the first and second years <PER>Hermione</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> had just passed had a ruffled, flattened look about them.
“No, <PER>Harry</PER>, it’s gotta be now while ev’ryone’s lookin’ the other way Please?” <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s nose was gently dripping blood.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not seen <PER>Harry</PER> this close up since <PER>Harry</PER>'s return to the school; <PER>Harry</PER> looked utterly woebegone.
“ ’Course,” said <PER>Harry</PER> at once, “ ’course we’ll come” He and <PER>Hermione</PER> edged back along their row of seats, causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them.
The people in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s row were not complaining, merely attempting to make The people in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s row as small as possible.
“I jus’ hope she doesn’ notice us goin’” “You mean <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Give us more time ” “What is it, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking up at him with a concerned expression on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face as they hurried across the lawn toward the edge of the forest.
When They reached his cabin, <PER>Hermione</PER> turned automatically left toward the front door; <PER>Hagrid</PER>, however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree.
“C’mon now, quick, before we’re spotted!” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other, then ducked into the cover of the trees behind <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who was already striding away from them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> ran to catch up with <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, why are you armed?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other, startled, but <PER>Hagrid</PER>, scowling, did not elaborate.
“Anyway,” he said, breathing a little more heavily than usual, “since then the other centaurs Ve bin livid with Ve bin an’ the trouble is, the other centaurs’ve got a lot of influence in the forest Cleverest creatures in here “Is that why we’re here, <PER>Hagrid</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>.
They were soon a long way past the clearing where <PER>Hagrid</PER> had shown them the thestrals, but <PER>Harry</PER> felt no sense of unease until <PER>Hagrid</PER> stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees toward the dark heart of the forest.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, fighting <PER>Harry</PER>'s way through thickly knotted brambles over which <PER>Hagrid</PER> had stepped easily and remembering very vividly what had happened to <PER>Harry</PER> on the other occasions <PER>Harry</PER> had stepped off the forest path.
“C’mon, <PER>Harry</PER> We need ter keep together now” It was a great struggle to keep up with <PER>Hagrid</PER>, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which <PER>Hagrid</PER> marched as easily as though they were cobwebs, but which snagged <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free they.
They were so deep in the forest now that sometimes all <PER>Harry</PER> could see of <PER>Hagrid</PER> in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him.
It occurred to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature — their absence struck him as rather ominous.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, would it be all right if we lit our wands?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
“Before we ge’ there, like.” “Good!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> set her back on her feet.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Harry</PER> looked nervous and sad again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> looked at each other, then back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What makes you think — ” “<PER>Umbridge</PER> reckons it was me that put tha’ niffler in her office.” “And was it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, before <PER>Harry</PER> could stop <PER>Harry</PER>.
“What do you want us to do?” <PER>Hagrid</PER> gave a great sniff and patted <PER>Harry</PER> wordlessly on the shoulder with such force that <PER>Harry</PER> was knocked sideways into a tree.
<PER>Harry</PER> had opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth to ask how much farther they had to go when <PER>Hagrid</PER> threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop.
“Very quiet, now ” They crept forward and <PER>Harry</PER> saw that they were facing a large, smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as <PER>Hagrid</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> thought, with a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal.
Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that Trees stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> now stood.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” her said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature, “who is he?” <PER>Harry</PER> found this an odd question “What is it?” was the one he had been planning on asking.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, you told us,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, her wand now shaking in her hand, “you told us none of them wanted to come!” <PER>Harry</PER> looked from her to <PER>Hagrid</PER> and then, as realization hit <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror.
The great mound of earth, on which he, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> could easily have stood, was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep, grunting breathing.
“But I had ter bring him, <PER>Hermione</PER>, I had ter!” “But why?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, who sounded as though <PER>Hermione</PER> wanted to cry.
“Why — what — oh, <PER>Hagrid</PER>\” “I knew if I jus’ got him back,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, sounding close to tears himself, “an’ — an’ taught himself a few manners — I’d be able ter take ter outside an’ show ev’ryone ter’s harmless!” “Harmless!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrilly, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep.
“Oh <PER>Hagrid</PER>, why did you bring him back if him didn’t want to come, wouldn’t him have been happier with him's own people?” “They were all bullyin’ him, <PER>Hermione</PER>, ’cause he’s so small!” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“Small?” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, I couldn’ leave him,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, tears now trickling down him's bruised face into him's beard.
“See — him’s my brother!” <PER>Hermione</PER> simply stared at him, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mouth open.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>, when you say ‘brother,’ ” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly, “do you mean — ?” “Well — half-brother,” amended <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees toward the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with <PER>Harry</PER>'s back to them.
“You have to keep <PER>Harry</PER> tied up?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> faintly.
“So what is it you want <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> and me to do?” <PER>Hermione</PER> asked apprehensively.
“After I’m gone.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> exchanged miserable looks, <PER>Harry</PER> uncomfortably aware that <PER>Harry</PER> had already promised <PER>Hagrid</PER> that <PER>Harry</PER> would do whatever <PER>Harry</PER> asked.
What <PER>Harry</PER> had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound <PER>Harry</PER> now recognized as Grawp ’s head.
“You want us to teach <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said in a hollow voice.
Of course, the other creatures who lived in the forest would have heard <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English “Yeah — even if yeh jus’ talk ter him a bit,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> hopefully.
“ ’Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he’ll understand more that we all like he really, an’ want he to stay” <PER>Harry</PER> looked at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who peered back at <PER>Harry</PER> from between the fingers over her face.
“Yeh’ll do it, then?” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, who did not seem to have caught what <PER>Harry</PER> had just said.
“We’ll ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, already bound by <PER>Harry</PER>'s promise.
“We’ll try, <PER>Hagrid</PER>” “I knew I could count on yeh, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Hagrid</PER> said, beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again.
“An’ I don’ wan’ yeh ter put yerself out too much, like I know yeh’ve got exams If yeh could jus’ nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an’ have a little chat with yeh I’ll wake yeh up, then — introduce you — ” “Wha — no!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, jumping up, “<PER>Hagrid</PER>, no, don’t wake yeh, really, we don’t need — ” But “<PER>Hagrid</PER> had already stepped over the great trunk in front of them and was proceeding toward Grawp.
When “<PER>Hagrid</PER> was around ten feet away, “<PER>Hagrid</PER> lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled reassuringly over “<PER>Hagrid</PER>'s shoulder at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, and then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough.
In front of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push he onto his knees and turned his head to see who and what had disturbed he.
“Had a nice sleep, eh?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights.
“Oh my ” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Hermione</PER> squeal, terrified, beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“This,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, hastening over to where <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stood, “is <PER>Harry</PER>, Grawp!
Turning to <PER>Hermione</PER> he said, “Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, <PER>Hermione</PER>?
“We’ll — er — We’ll go back now, shall We?” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded.
And he had promised that he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> would continue <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s totally pointless attempts to civilize the giant How could <PER>Hagrid</PER>, even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were lovably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans?
“Hold it,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> abruptly, just as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> raised their wands; now that they had stopped walking, they too could hear movement close by.
<PER>Harry</PER> recognized the black-bodied and bearded Bane, whom <PER>Harry</PER> had met nearly four years ago on the same night <PER>Harry</PER> had met Firenze.
“There can be no return from such disgrace.” “If yeh say so,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER>, shrugging, “but personally I think yeh ’re makin’ a big mistake — ” “As are you, human,” said Bane, “coming back into our forest when we warned you — ” “Now, you listen ter me,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> angrily.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as both Bane and the gray centaur pawed at the ground, “let’s go, please lets go!
“You’ll tolerate him as long as him’s here, it’s as much him's forest as yours!” he yelled, while <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> both pushed with all their might against <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forward.
“Ruddy old nags though, eh?” “<PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, “if the centaurs don’t want humans in the forest, it doesn’t really look as though <PER>Harry</PER> and I will be able “Ah, you heard what they said,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> dismissively “they wouldn’t hurt foals — I mean, kids.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hermione</PER> looked much the worse for wear; <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hair was full of bits of twig and leaves, <PER>Hermione</PER>'s robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face and arms.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> could look little better.
“Well see you later, then, <PER>Hagrid</PER>” “I don’t believe him,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a very unsteady voice, the moment they were out of earshot of <PER>Hagrid</PER>.
“He’s not asking us to do anything unless He gets chucked out and that might not even happen — ” “Oh come off it, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily, stopping dead in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s tracks so that the people behind <PER>Hermione</PER>'s had to swerve to avoid <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Of course he’s going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest, after what we’ve just seen, who can blame <PER>Umbridge</PER>?” There was a pause in which <PER>Harry</PER> glared at her, and her eyes filled slowly with tears.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> ” said <PER>Harry</PER> slowly.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of “Weasley Is Our King” died away.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure whether it was <PER>Harry</PER>'s imagination or not, but <PER>Harry</PER> rather thought <PER>Harry</PER> saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the treetops in the distance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch Cup was such that <PER>Ron</PER>’s could not settle to anything next day.
All he wanted to do was talk over the match and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp — not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring <PER>Ron</PER> back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion.
“And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later — what?” <PER>Ron</PER> said, stopping mid- sentence at the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
“Why are you grinning?” “I’m not,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quickly, looking down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s Transfiguration notes and attempting to straighten <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
The truth was that <PER>Ron</PER> had just reminded <PER>Harry</PER> forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree.
“Well, actually no, <PER>Ron</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> with a heavy sigh, putting down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s book and looking at him apologetically.
“As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match <PER>Harry</PER> and I saw was Davies’s first goal.” <PER>Ron</PER>’s carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment.
“But <PER>Ron</PER>, we didn’t want to leave — we had to!” “Yeah?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, whose face was growing rather red.
“How come?” “It was <PER>Hagrid</PER>,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And <PER>Hagrid</PER> wants us to ?” “Teach him English, yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the O.W.L.s from <PER>Harry</PER>’s mind, though <PER>Harry</PER> did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told <PER>Snape</PER> that he must continue giving <PER>Harry</PER> Occlumency tuition: If he had, then <PER>Snape</PER> had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as <PER>Snape</PER> was now ignoring <PER>Harry</PER>.
This suited <PER>Harry</PER> very well; <PER>Harry</PER> was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with <PER>Snape</PER>, and to <PER>Harry</PER>'s relief <PER>Hermione</PER> was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency. ]
relief <PER>Hermione</PER> was spending a lot of time muttering to ] relief <PER>Hermione</PER> and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.
“How many hours d’you think you’re doing a day?” he demanded of <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.
Meanwhile <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> had found a different way to induce panic.
“Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran’s, and she’s never mentioned the <PER>Malfoy</PER>s.” “What’s she like, <PER>Neville</PER>?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> at once.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> glanced at one another, but didn’t know what to say.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio’s Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine “Outstanding” O.W.L.s <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had gained the previous summer and was offering the whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons.
<PER>Ron</PER> assured <PER>Harry</PER> he would reimburse <PER>Harry</PER> for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, <PER>Hermione</PER> had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, we wanted to buy that!” shouted <PER>Ron</PER>.
“It’s supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours — <PER>Hermione</PER>, let me have a pinch, go on, it can’t hurt — ” “This stuff can,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> grimly.
“I’ve had a look at it, and it’s actually dried doxy droppings.” This information took the edge off <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER>’s desire for brain stimulants.
“Excellent,” said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, “so we don’t have to worry about it till the holidays” <PER>Harry</PER> imagined sitting in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks’ time, waiting for his O.W.L.
<PER>Harry</PER> agreed to test <PER>Hermione</PER> after lunch on Sunday but regretted it almost at once.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from <PER>Harry</PER> to check that <PER>Hermione</PER> had gotten the answer completely right, finally hitting <PER>Harry</PER> hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day.
<PER>Umbridge</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> nodded and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> hastened toward the double doors into the entrance hall, slowing down as <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; <PER>Umbridge</PER> was speaking to her very deferentially.
“No idea where he is, I suppose?” “None at all,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, shooting a malevolent look at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as <PER>Ron</PER> pretended to do up his shoelace.
<PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Harry</PER>'s careers consultation and <PER>McGonagall</PER>’s furious declaration that she would help <PER>Harry</PER> become an Auror if it was the last thing she did <PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here <PER>Harry</PER> knew that <PER>Harry</PER> was not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally, one by one, none of the others in the dormitory fell asleep.
Parvati was practicing incantations under Parvati's breath while the salt cellar in front of Parvati's twitched, <PER>Hermione</PER> was rereading Achievement in Charming so fast that <PER>Hermione</PER>'s eyes appeared blurred, and <PER>Neville</PER> kept dropping <PER>Neville</PER>'s knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.
Then, at half-past nine, they were called forward class by class to reenter the Great Hall, which was now arranged exactly as <PER>Harry</PER> had seen it in the Pensieve when his father, Sirius, and <PER>Snape</PER> had been taking their O.W.L.s.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned over <PER>Harry</PER>'s paper, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart thumping hard Three rows to <PER>Harry</PER>'s right and four seats ahead, <PER>Hermione</PER> was already scribbling <PER>Harry</PER> lowered <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes to the first question: a) Give the incantation, and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly <PER>Harry</PER> had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll Smiling slightly, <PER>Harry</PER> bent over the paper and began to write “Well, it wasn’t too bad, was it?” asked <PER>Hermione</PER> anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later, still clutching the paper.
Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had no idea how <PER>Hermione</PER> had done.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>’ll be fine — remember <PER>Hermione</PER> got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests?” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, “Parkinson, Pansy — Patil, Padma — Patil, Parvati — Potter, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Good luck,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked into the Great Hall, clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand so tightly <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand shook.
Professor Tofty pointed <PER>Harry</PER> toward what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner, who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
“The famous Potter?” Out of the corner of his eye, <PER>Harry</PER> distinctly saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> throw a scathing look over at <PER>Harry</PER>; the wine glass <PER>Malfoy</PER> had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed.
“That’s it,” he said in his quavery old voice, “no need to be nervous Now, if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some cartwheels for me” On the whole <PER>Harry</PER> thought it went rather well; <PER>Harry</PER>'s Levitation Charm was certainly much better than <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s had been, though <PER>Harry</PER> wished <PER>Harry</PER> had not mixed up the incantations for Color- Change and Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before <PER>Harry</PER> could rectify his mistake.
he was glad <PER>Hermione</PER> had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s afterward.
He could tell <PER>Ron</PER>, though; <PER>Ron</PER> had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened.
<PER>Harry</PER> went to bed, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head buzzing with complex spell models and theories.
<PER>Harry</PER> forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during <PER>Harry</PER>'s written exam next morning, but thought <PER>Harry</PER>'s practical could have been a lot worse.
At least <PER>Harry</PER> managed to vanish the whole of <PER>Harry</PER>'s iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost Hannah Abbott's head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply Hannah Abbott's ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall.
the birds had the birds's Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER> had done reasonably well) and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Here, for the first time, <PER>Harry</PER> felt sure <PER>Harry</PER> had passed.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining <PER>Harry</PER> again, when <PER>Harry</PER> demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell.
“Very well, Potter, you may go!” As <PER>Harry</PER> passed <PER>Umbridge</PER> beside the door their eyes met.
On Friday, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> had a day off while <PER>Hermione</PER> sat <PER>Hermione</PER>'s Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front of them, them permitted them a break from studying.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> in the distance, teaching a class on the edge of the forest.
<PER>Harry</PER> was trying to guess what creatures they were examining <PER>Harry</PER> thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little — when the portrait hole opened and <PER>Hermione</PER> clambered in, looking thoroughly bad tempered.
“It means ‘partnership,’ not ‘defense,’ I mixed it up with ‘eihwaz.’ ” “Ah well,” said <PER>Ron</PER> lazily, “that’s only one mistake, isn’t it, you’ll still get — ” “Oh shut up,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> angrily, “it could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> thinks it’s <PER>Hagrid</PER> doing it, remember?
“Oh, you’re so naive sometimes, <PER>Harry</PER>, you really think <PER>Umbridge</PER> will wait for proof?” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she swept off toward the girls’ dormitories, banging the door behind she.
“Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, very quietly, prodding his queen forward so that she could begin beating up one of <PER>Harry</PER>’s knights.
<PER>Hermione</PER> ’s bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday studying for Potions on Monday, the exam to which <PER>Harry</PER> was looking forward least and which <PER>Harry</PER> was sure would be the one that would be the downfall of <PER>Harry</PER>'s ambitions to become an Auror.
Sure enough, <PER>Harry</PER> found the written exam difficult, though <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion: <PER>Harry</PER> could describe its effects extremely accurately, having taken its illegally in <PER>Harry</PER>'s second year.
<PER>Neville</PER>, who was sitting very near <PER>Harry</PER>, also looked happier than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen <PER>Harry</PER> during a Potions class.
“I’ve got Arithmancy and it’s probably the toughest subject there is!” Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so <PER>Hermione</PER> was unable to vent <PER>Hermione</PER>'s spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first years for giggling too loudly in the common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> was determined to perform well in Tuesday’s Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let <PER>Hagrid</PER> down.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Hagrid</PER> watching anxiously out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s cabin window.
When <PER>Harry</PER>’s examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at him and told him him could leave, <PER>Harry</PER> gave <PER>Hagrid</PER> a fleeting thumbs-up before heading back up to the castle.
The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went well enough; <PER>Harry</PER> was not convinced <PER>Harry</PER> had got the names of all of Jupiter’s moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice.
<PER>Harry</PER> might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; <PER>Harry</PER> lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s head completely during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to <PER>Harry</PER> as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger, and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that her ought to have died the previous Tuesday.
He had just made <PER>Harry</PER> feel rather better by telling <PER>Harry</PER> how <PER>Harry</PER> told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look up and realize his had been describing his examiner’s reflection.
“No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly ” “And from now on, I don’t care if my tea leaves spell die, <PER>Ron</PER>, die — I’m just chucking them in the bin where them belong.” <PER>Harry</PER> laughed just as <PER>Hermione</PER> came running up behind them.
“Well, I think I’ve done all right in Arithmancy,” she said, and <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> both sighed with relief.
As <PER>Harry</PER> completed the constellation Orion on <PER>Harry</PER>'s chart, however, the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where <PER>Harry</PER> was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced down as <PER>Harry</PER> made a slight adjustment to the position of <PER>Harry</PER>'s telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the front doors of the castle swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye back to <PER>Harry</PER>'s telescope and refocused <PER>Harry</PER>'s telescope, now examining Venus.
Even at this distance, <PER>Harry</PER> had a funny feeling that <PER>Harry</PER> recognized the walk of the squattest among them, who seemed to be leading the group.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not think why <PER>Umbridge</PER> would be taking a stroll outside past midnight, much less accompanied by five others.
Then somebody coughed behind <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> remembered that <PER>Harry</PER> was halfway through an exam.
<PER>Harry</PER> had quite forgotten Venus’s position — jamming <PER>Harry</PER>'s eye to <PER>Harry</PER>'s telescope, <PER>Harry</PER> found it again and was again on the point of entering it on <PER>Harry</PER>'s chart when, alert for any odd sound, <PER>Harry</PER> heard a distant knock that echoed through the deserted grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked up, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart hammering.
<PER>Harry</PER> glanced around to see whether <PER>Ron</PER> or <PER>Hermione</PER> had noticed what <PER>Harry</PER> had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind Professor Marchbanks at that moment, and not wanting to appear as though Professor Marchbanks was sneaking looks at anyone else’s work, he hastily bent over his star chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet toward <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
Several of the people around <PER>Harry</PER> ducked out from behind the people around <PER>Harry</PER>'s telescopes and peered instead in the direction of <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked to <PER>Harry</PER>'s left.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was gazing transfixed at <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
<PER>Hermione</PER> jumped and returned at once to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s star chart; <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at <PER>Harry</PER>'s own and noticed that <PER>Harry</PER> had mislabelled Venus as Mars.
<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s's direction, seemed to be attempting to Stun <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s.
Cries and yells echoed across the grounds; a man yelled, “Be reasonable, <PER>Hagrid</PER>!” and <PER>Hagrid</PER> roared, “Reasonable be damned, yeh won’ take me like this, Dawlish!” <PER>Harry</PER> could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend <PER>Hagrid</PER>, leaping at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and him fell to the ground.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gasped, both hands over her mouth; <PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Ron</PER> and saw that <PER>Harry</PER> too was looking scared.
“How dare you!” “It’s <PER>McGonagall</PER>!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw him double over and thought for a moment that <PER>Harry</PER> had finally been overcome by a spell, but on the contrary, next moment <PER>Hagrid</PER> was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back — then <PER>Harry</PER> realized that Fang’s limp body was draped around <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulders.
“Get <PER>Harry</PER>, get <PER>Harry</PER>!” screamed <PER>Umbridge</PER>, but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of <PER>Hagrid</PER> ’s fists.
<PER>Hagrid</PER> had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck; <PER>Umbridge</PER> sent one last Stunning Spell after him but it missed, and <PER>Hagrid</PER>, running full-pelt toward the distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.
When it came at last he, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> did well, didn’t he?” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who looked more alarmed than impressed.
“At least they didn’t get to take <PER>Hagrid</PER> off to Azkaban,” said <PER>Ron</PER>.
“I ’spect he’s gone to join <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, hasn’t he?” “I suppose so,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked tearful.
“Oh, this is awful, I really thought <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would be back before long, but now we’ve lost <PER>Hagrid</PER> too” They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full.
Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, were now telling everyone what they had heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.
“It’s not like Trelawney, he’s been teaching much better than usual this year!” “<PER>Umbridge</PER> hates part-humans,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> bitterly, flopping down into an armchair.
“<PER>Hermione</PER> was always going to try and get <PER>Hagrid</PER> out.” “And <PER>Hermione</PER> thought <PER>Hagrid</PER> was putting nifflers in her office,” piped up Katie Bell.
“He was too close to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.” “That’s true,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, sinking into an armchair beside <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt wide awake — the image of <PER>Hagrid</PER> sprinting away into the dark was haunting <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was so angry with <PER>Umbridge</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though <PER>Ron</PER>’s suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had its merits.
<PER>Harry</PER> would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but <PER>Harry</PER> had been counting on the morning for a spot of last- minute studying, so instead <PER>Harry</PER> sat with <PER>Harry</PER>'s head in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands by the common room window, trying hard not to doze off as <PER>Harry</PER> read through some of the notes stacked three-and-a-half feet high that <PER>Hermione</PER> had lent him.
<PER>Harry</PER> just wanted this to be over so that <PER>Harry</PER> could go and sleep.
Then tomorrow, <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch — <PER>Harry</PER> was going to have a fly on <PER>Ron</PER>’s broom and savor their freedom from studying “Turn over your papers,” said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass.
I know this, <PER>Harry</PER> thought, though <PER>Harry</PER>'s brain felt torpid and slack.
<PER>Harry</PER> could visualize a heading, in <PER>Hermione</PER>’s handwriting: The Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards <PER>Harry</PER> had read these notes only this morning <PER>Harry</PER> began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks.
Once or twice <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved shis head very slightly and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it.
<PER>Harry</PER> had a feeling it had something to do with trolls <PER>Harry</PER> gazed blankly at the back of Parvati ’s head again.
It did not seem very informative or detailed, yet he was sure <PER>Hermione</PER>’s notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages he closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember the confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had written that already Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted he had written that too And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come Think, he told he, his face in his hands, while all around he quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled through the hourglass at the front he was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last The black door swung open for he as usual, and here he was in the circular room with its many doors Straight across the stone floor and through the second door patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry he jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the others Once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass spheres he heart was beating very fast now he was going to get there this time When he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving upon the floor like a wounded animal <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach contracted with fear with excitement A voice issued from <PER>Harry</PER>'s own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human kindness, “Take it for me Lift it down, now I cannot touch it but you can” The black shape upon the floor shifted a little.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw a long-fingered white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of <PER>Harry</PER>'s own arm heard the high, cold voice say, “ Cruciol ” The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell back, writhing.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, the curse lifted, and the figure groaned and became motionless.
“Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> is waiting” Very slowly, Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s arms trembling, the man on the ground raised Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s shoulders a few inches and lifted Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> hit the ground and awoke, still yelling, <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar on fire, as the Great Hall erupted all around <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m — I’m fine, sir,” <PER>Harry</PER> stammered, wiping the sweat from <PER>Harry</PER>'s face.
“Potter, what do you think you’re doing?” “I need to see Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>,” gasped <PER>Harry</PER>, the breath tearing his lungs.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had gone, <PER>Hagrid</PER> had gone, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had always expected Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> to be there, irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly present “I don’t wonder you’re shocked, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in Madam Pomfrey's face.
He strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where He stood, buffeted by the crowd, the panic expanding inside He like poison gas so that He's head swam and He could not think what to do <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>, said a voice in He's head.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> at once, looking very frightened.
“Come on, I’ve got to tell you something” He led them along the first-floor corridor, peering through doorways, and at last found an empty classroom into which He dived, closing the door behind <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> the moment they were inside and leaning against it, facing they.
Then <PER>Ron</PER> said, “G-get there?” “Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius!” <PER>Harry</PER> said loudly.
“But — <PER>Harry</PER> ” said <PER>Ron</PER> weakly.
“<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> in a rather frightened voice, “er how how did <PER>Voldemort</PER> get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing <PER>Voldemort</PER> was there?” “How do I know?” bellowed <PER>Harry</PER>.
“The question is how we’re going to get in there!” “But <PER>Harry</PER>, think about this,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, taking a step toward him, “it’s five o’clock in the afternoon the Ministry of Magic must be full of workers How would <PER>Voldemort</PER> and Sirius have got in without being seen?
“Anyway, the Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever I’ve been — ” “You’ve never been there, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly.
“How d’you explain <PER>Ron</PER>’s dad then, what was all that about, how come I knew what had happened to him?” “He’s got a point,” said <PER>Ron</PER> quietly, looking at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, how on earth could <PER>Voldemort</PER> have got hold of Sirius when <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s been in Grimmauld Place all the time?” “Sirius might’ve cracked and just wanted some fresh air,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, sounding worried.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s been desperate to get out of that house for ages — ” “But why,” <PER>Hermione</PER> persisted, “why on earth would <PER>Voldemort</PER> want to use “Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is?” “I dunno, there could be loads of reasons!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled at her.
“Maybe “Sirius is just someone <PER>Voldemort</PER> doesn’t care about seeing hurt — ” “You know what, I’ve just thought of something,” said <PER>Ron</PER> in a hushed voice.
“Look, I’m sorry,” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, “but neither of you are making sense, and we’ve got no proof for any of this, no proof <PER>Voldemort</PER> and Sirius are even there — ” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>’s seen them!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, rounding on her.
I mean, it was really great of you and everything,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on <PER>Harry</PER>’s face.
“Everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do — ” “That’s funny,” said <PER>Harry</PER> in a trembling voice, “because I definitely remember <PER>Ron</PER> saying I’d wasted time acting the hero Is that what you think this is?
“I’m trying to say — <PER>Voldemort</PER> knows you, <PER>Harry</PER>!
“But <PER>Harry</PER>, you’ve just said it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> fiercely.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> whipped around.
<PER>Ginny</PER> walked in, looking curious, followed by Luna, who as usual looked as though <PER>Ginny</PER> had drifted in accidentally.
“We recognized <PER>Harry</PER>’s voice — what are you yelling about?” “Never you mind,” said <PER>Harry</PER> roughly.
“Wait <PER>Harry</PER>, they can help.” <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> looked at her.
“Listen,” she said urgently, “<PER>Harry</PER>, we need to establish whether Sirius really has left headquarters “I’ve told you, I saw — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, I’m begging you, please!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> desperately.
“We haven’t got time to waste — ” “But if this is a trick of V-<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s — <PER>Harry</PER>, we’ve got to check, we’ve got to — ” “How?” <PER>Harry</PER> demanded.
“How’re we going to check?” “we’ll have to use <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s fire and see if we can contact him,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, who looked positively terrified at the thought.
“Well draw <PER>Umbridge</PER> away again, but we’ll need lookouts, and that’s where we can use <PER>Ginny</PER> and Luna.” Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, <PER>Ginny</PER> said immediately, “Yeah, well do it,” and Luna said, “When you say ‘Sirius,’ are you talking about Stubby Boardman?” Nobody answered <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Okay,” <PER>Harry</PER> said aggressively to <PER>Hermione</PER>, “Okay, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I’m with you, otherwise I’m going to the Department of Mysteries right now — ” “the Department of Mysteries?” said Luna, looking mildly surprised.
“Right,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, twisting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands together and pacing up and down between the desks.
“Now, we need to keep students away from shis office while we force entry, or some Slytherin’s bound to go and tip shis off” “Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> promptly, “and warn people not to go down there because someone’s let off a load of Garroting Gas.” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked surprised at the readiness with which <PER>Ginny</PER> had come up with this lie.
<PER>Ginny</PER> shrugged and said, “Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.” “Okay,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, “well then, <PER>Harry</PER>, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak, and we’ll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius — ” “He’s not there, <PER>Hermione</PER>!” “I mean, you can — can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don’t think you should be in there alone, Lee’s already proved the window’s a weak spot, sending those nifflers through it.” Even through Lee’s's anger and impatience <PER>Harry</PER> recognized <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s offer to accompany <PER>Harry</PER> into <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty.
“Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don’t think we’re going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking relieved that <PER>Harry</PER> seemed to have accepted the plan, “not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.” “Five minutes’ll be enough,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we’ll meet you at the end of <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s corridor, okay?” <PER>Harry</PER> did not answer, but flung okay?” <PER>Harry</PER> out of the room and began to fight okay?” <PER>Harry</PER>'s way through the milling crowds outside.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius’s knife secure in <PER>Harry</PER>'s bag, before they noticed <PER>Harry</PER> had left they.
“So <PER>Ron</PER> — you go and head <PER>Umbridge</PER> off <PER>Ginny</PER>, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor <PER>Harry</PER> and I will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear” <PER>Ron</PER> strode away, his bright red hair visible right to the end of the passage.
“Get over here,” muttered <PER>Hermione</PER>, tugging at <PER>Harry</PER>’s wrist and pulling <PER>Harry</PER> back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column.
It had hurt much worse than this when <PER>Voldemort</PER> had been punishing Avery “Here,” <PER>Voldemort</PER> said.
When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, <PER>Hermione</PER> said quietly, “I think that’s as good as we’re going to get, <PER>Harry</PER> — come on, let’s do it.” Together they moved forward, covered by the cloak.
As they passed <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER> whispered, “Good one don’t forget the signal ” “What’s the signal?” muttered <PER>Harry</PER>, as they approached <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s door.
“A loud chorus of Weasley Is Our King’ if they see <PER>Umbridge</PER> coming,” replied <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> inserted the blade of Sirius’s knife in the crack between door and wall.
<PER>Hermione</PER> hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand out.
<PER>Harry</PER> knelt down quickly, thrust <PER>Harry</PER>'s head into the dancing fire, and cried, “Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!” <PER>Harry</PER> head began to spin as though <PER>Harry</PER> had just got off a fairground ride though <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees remained firmly planted upon the cold office floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes screwed up against the whirling ash, and when the spinning stopped, <PER>Harry</PER> opened them to find <PER>Harry</PER> looking out upon the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place.
“I’m warning you!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, fully aware that <PER>Harry</PER>'s scope for inflicting punishment upon Kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position.
<PER>Harry</PER> could just make out the back of <PER>Harry</PER>'s bald head through the forest of chair legs before <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You — !” But before he could utter a single curse or insult, <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great pain at the top of <PER>Harry</PER>'s head.
<PER>Harry</PER> inhaled a lot of ash and, choking, found <PER>Harry</PER> being dragged backward through the flames until, with a horrible abruptness, <PER>Harry</PER> was staring up into the wide, pallid face of Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who had dragged <PER>Harry</PER> backward out of the fire by the hair and was now bending <PER>Harry</PER>'s neck back as far as it would go as though she was going to slit <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
“You think,” she whispered, bending <PER>Harry</PER>’s neck back even farther, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s was looking up at the ceiling above him, “that after two nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge?
“Hers too ” <PER>Harry</PER> heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that <PER>Hermione</PER> had just had <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand wrested from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s as well.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> was leaning on the windowsill, smirking as he threw <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand into the air one- handed and then caught it again.
There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered, each gripping <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, Luna, and — to <PER>Harry</PER>’s bewilderment — <PER>Neville</PER>, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation.
“ That one.” he poked a thick finger at <PER>Neville</PER>, “tried to stop me taking her,” he pointed at <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her, “so I brought him along too.” “Good, good,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, watching <PER>Ginny</PER>’s struggles.
“You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon,” she nodded at <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Malfoy</PER> laughed even louder, “to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mister Filch having just informed me so.
<PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER> was so full of rage and hatred <PER>Harry</PER> was shaking.
<PER>Ron</PER>’s lip was bleeding onto <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s carpet as <PER>Ron</PER>’s lip struggled against Warrington’s half nelson.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was still trying to stamp on the feet of the sixth-year girl who had both <PER>Ginny</PER>'s upper arms in a tight grip.
<PER>Neville</PER> was turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at Crabbe’s arms, and <PER>Hermione</PER> was attempting vainly to throw Millicent Bulstrode off <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back at <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who was watching <PER>Harry</PER> closely.
<PER>Harry</PER> kept <PER>Harry</PER>'s face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and <PER>Draco</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> came back into the room, holding open the door for <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Ah, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, smiling widely and standing up again.
<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s thought desperately.
<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s got Sirius — “You are on probation!” shrieked Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, and <PER>Snape</PER> looked back at Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, <PER>Snape</PER>'s eyebrows slightly raised.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER>'s last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door.
“He’s got Padfoot at the place where it’s hidden!” <PER>Snape</PER> had stopped with <PER>Snape</PER>'s hand on <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s door handle.
“Padfoot?” cried Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, looking eagerly from <PER>Harry</PER> to <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not tell whether <PER>Harry</PER> had understood or not, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare speak more plainly in front of <PER>Umbridge</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt horribly powerless without <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand as <PER>Harry</PER> watched her.
“You are forcing me, Potter I do not want to,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, still moving restlessly on the spot, “but sometimes circumstances justify the use I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice” <PER>Malfoy</PER> was watching her with a hungry expression on his face.
“Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> — it’s illegal” — but <PER>Umbridge</PER> took no notice.
“The Minister wouldn’t want you to break the law, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>!” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“What <PER>Cornelius</PER> doesn’t know won’t hurt What <PER>Cornelius</PER>,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who was now panting slightly as she pointed shis wand at different parts of <PER>Harry</PER>’s body in turn, apparently trying to decide what would hurt the most.
“<PER>Harry</PER> never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last summer, but <PER>Harry</PER> was delighted to be given the chance to expel <PER>Harry</PER>, all the same” “It was you?” gasped <PER>Harry</PER>.
“ You sent the dementors after me?” “ Somebody had to act,” breathed <PER>Umbridge</PER>, as her wand came to rest pointing directly at <PER>Harry</PER>’s forehead.
“No — <PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER>, well have to tell her!” “No way!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, staring at the little of <PER>Hermione</PER> he could see.
“We’ll have to, <PER>Harry</PER>, shell force it out of you anyway, what’s what’s the point ?” And <PER>Hermione</PER> began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode ’s robes.
<PER>Ginny</PER> was staring at <PER>Hermione</PER> as though <PER>Ginny</PER> had never seen <PER>Ginny</PER>'s before; <PER>Neville</PER>, still choking for breath, was gazing at <PER>Ginny</PER>'s too.
Though <PER>Hermione</PER> was sobbing desperately into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands, there was no trace of a tear “I’m — I’m sorry everyone,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“But — I can’t stand it — ■” “That’s right, that’s right, girl!” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, seizing <PER>Hermione</PER> by the shoulders, thrusting <PER>Hermione</PER>'s into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Now then with whom was Potter communicating just now?” “Well,” gulped <PER>Hermione</PER> into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands, “well, he was trying to speak to Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>” <PER>Ron</PER> froze, his eyes wide; <PER>Ginny</PER> stopped trying to stamp on her Slytherin captor’s toes; even Luna looked mildly surprised.
Fortunately, the attention of <PER>Umbridge</PER> and her minions was focused too exclusively upon <PER>Hermione</PER> to notice these suspicious signs.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> eagerly.
“You know where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> is, then?” “Well no!” sobbed <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“We’ve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog’s Head — ” “Idiot girl, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> won’t be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry’s looking for him!” shouted <PER>Umbridge</PER>, disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face.
“But — but we needed to tell him something important!” wailed <PER>Hermione</PER>, holding <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands more tightly over <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face, not, <PER>Harry</PER> knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears.
“What’s ready?” demanded <PER>Umbridge</PER>, and now <PER>Umbridge</PER> grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulders again and shook <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s slightly.
“But he had to leave before it was finished and n-n-now we’ve finished it for he, and we c-c-can’t find him t-t-to tell he!” “What kind of weapon is it?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> harshly, her stubby hands still tight on <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s shoulders.
“We j-j-just did what P-P-Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER> told us t-t-to do ” <PER>Umbridge</PER> straightened up, looking exultant.
‘Tm not showing them,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> shrilly, looking around at the Slytherins through <PER>Hermione</PER> shrilly's fingers.
“Fine,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now sobbing into <PER>Hermione</PER>'s hands again, “fine let them see it, I hope them use it on you!
<PER>Umbridge</PER> contemplated <PER>Hermione</PER> for another long moment and then spoke in what She clearly thought was a motherly voice.
“And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> with <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand.
“Lead on” <PER>Harry</PER> had no idea what <PER>Hermione</PER> was planning, or even whether <PER>Hermione</PER> had a plan.
It seemed incredible to <PER>Harry</PER> that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world <PER>Hermione</PER> walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air.
The sun was falling toward the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now as <PER>Hermione</PER> marched purposefully across the grass, <PER>Umbridge</PER> jogging to keep up.
“It’s hidden in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s hut, is it?” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> eagerly in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER> might have set it off accidentally.” “Yes,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, whose excitement seemed to be mounting.
<PER>Harry</PER> scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as <PER>Harry</PER> knew it would if <PER>Voldemort</PER> had moved in for the kill “Then where is it?” asked <PER>Umbridge</PER>, with a hint of uncertainty in <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s voice as <PER>Hermione</PER> continued to stride toward the forest.
“No, I don’t think so, Potter,” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> sweetly, poking <PER>Harry</PER> in the back with it.
“The Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours, I’m afraid.” As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, <PER>Harry</PER> tried to catch <PER>Hermione</PER> ’s eye; walking into the forest without wands seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening.
She, however, merely gave <PER>Umbridge</PER> a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that <PER>Umbridge</PER>, with Shis shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up.
<PER>Hermione</PER> had not been with him on that occasion; him doubted <PER>Hermione</PER> had any idea what danger lay at the end of it.
Neither of them paused to help her up again; <PER>Hermione</PER> merely strode on, calling loudly over her shoulder, “It’s a bit further in!” “<PER>Hermione</PER>, keep your voice down,” <PER>Harry</PER> muttered, hurrying to catch up with “<PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had the feeling <PER>Harry</PER> had had before in the forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes “How much further?” demanded <PER>Umbridge</PER> angrily from behind him.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel the forest floor trembling; <PER>Umbridge</PER> gave a little scream and pushed <PER>Harry</PER> in front of her like a shield — <PER>Harry</PER> wrenched <PER>Harry</PER> free of her and turned.
Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Umbridge</PER>, who backed slowly into the center of the clearing, <PER>Umbridge</PER> uttering odd little whimpers of terror.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked sideways at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
On <PER>Harry</PER>’s right, <PER>Umbridge</PER> was still whimpering, her wand trembling violently as her pointed it at the advancing centaur.
“I am Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER>!” said <PER>Umbridge</PER> in a high- pitched, terrified voice.
“Don’t call them that!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said furiously, but <PER>Umbridge</PER> did not appear to have heard <PER>Hermione</PER>.
Still pointing <PER>Hermione</PER>'s shaking wand at Magorian, <PER>Hermione</PER> continued, “Law Fifteen B states clearly that ‘Any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions — ’ ” “ ‘Near-human intelligence’?” repeated Magorian, as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground.
<PER>Harry</PER> grabbed <PER>Hermione</PER> and pulled <PER>Hermione</PER>'s to the ground.
Lifting his head a few inches, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Umbridge</PER> had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright.
“Now!” roared a voice in <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged <PER>Harry</PER> upright; <PER>Hermione</PER> too had been pulled to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet.
Over the plunging, many-colored backs and heads of the centaurs <PER>Harry</PER> saw <PER>Umbridge</PER> being borne away through the trees by Bane, still screaming nonstop; her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them.
“We do not attack foals.” “They brought her here, <PER>Ron</PER>an,” replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“And they are not so young He is nearing manhood, this one” He shook <PER>Harry</PER> by the neck of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Please,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> breathlessly, “please, don’t attack us, us don’t think like <PER>Hermione</PER>, us aren’t Ministry of Magic employees!
“We do not help humans!” snarled the centaur holding <PER>Harry</PER>, tightening <PER>Harry</PER>'s grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet left the ground momentarily.
A bearded centaur toward the back of the crowd shouted, “They came here unasked, They must pay the consequences!” A roar of approval met these words and a dun-colored centaur shouted, “They can join the woman!” “You said you didn’t hurt the innocent!” shouted <PER>Hermione</PER>, real tears sliding down <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face now.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s centaur let <PER>Harry</PER> fall to the ground again as <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands flew to <PER>Harry</PER>'s bow and quiver of arrows; <PER>Hermione</PER> had been dropped too, and <PER>Harry</PER> hurried toward <PER>Hermione</PER>'s as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap.
“Hagger.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what “hagger” meant, or what language it was from, nor did <PER>Harry</PER> much care — <PER>Harry</PER> was watching Grawp ’s feet, which were almost as long as <PER>Harry</PER>’s whole body.
<PER>Hermione</PER> gripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose huge, round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped.
<PER>Harry</PER> could feel <PER>Hermione</PER> shaking as Grawp opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling voice, “Hermy.” “Goodness,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, gripping <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint, “he — he remembered!” “Hermy!” roared Grawp.
Wandless, <PER>Harry</PER> braced <PER>Harry</PER> to punch, kick, bite, or whatever else it took as the hand flew toward <PER>Harry</PER> and knocked a snow- white centaur off <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs.
It was what the centaurs had been waiting for — Grawp’s outstretched fingers were a foot from <PER>Harry</PER> when fifty arrows went soaring through the air at the giant, peppering <PER>Harry</PER>'s enormous face, causing <PER>Harry</PER> to howl with pain and rage and straighten up again, rubbing <PER>Harry</PER>'s face with <PER>Harry</PER>'s enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the heads in still deeper.
<PER>Harry</PER> yelled and stamped <PER>Harry</PER>'s enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way.
Pebble-sized droplets of Grawp’s blood showered <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Hermione</PER> to <PER>Hermione</PER>'s feet and the pair of them ran as fast as them could for the shelter of the trees.
As <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> watched, — Grawp gave another roar of fury and plunged after them, smashing more trees aside as he went.
“Oh no,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, quaking so badly that <PER>Hermione</PER>'s knees gave way.
As <PER>Harry</PER> listened to them <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him.
Not only had <PER>Harry</PER> managed to lose <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever.
“By the time we’ve done that, Sirius 11 probably be dead!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, kicking a nearby tree in temper; there was a high-pitched chattering overhead and <PER>Harry</PER> looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Well, we can’t do anything without wands,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> hopelessly, dragging <PER>Hermione</PER> up again.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> moved instinctively together, peering through the trees, as <PER>Ron</PER> came into sight, with <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna hurrying along behind him.
All of them looked a little the worse for wear — there were several long scratches running the length of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s cheek, a large purple lump was swelling above <PER>Neville</PER>’s right eye, <PER>Ron</PER>’s lip was bleeding worse than ever — but all were looking rather pleased with themselves.
“So,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand, “had any ideas?” “How did you get away?” asked <PER>Harry</PER> in amazement, taking <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand from <PER>Ron</PER>.
“Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, <PER>Neville</PER> brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,” said <PER>Ron</PER> airily, now handing back <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand too.
“But <PER>Ginny</PER> was best, <PER>Ginny</PER> got <PER>Malfoy</PER> — Bat-Bogey Hex — it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great flapping things.
“<PER>Hagrid</PER>’s little brother,” said <PER>Ron</PER> promptly.
“Okay,” said <PER>Harry</PER> irritably, rounding on her, “first of all, “we’ aren’t doing anything if you’re including yourself in that, and second of all, <PER>Ron</PER>’s the only one with a broomstick that isn’t being guarded by a security troll, so — ” “I’ve got a broom!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>'s jaw set so that <PER>Ginny</PER>'s resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking.
“I’m three years older than you were when you fought <PER>Voldemort</PER> over the Sorcerer’s Stone,” she said fiercely, “and it’s because of me <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s stuck back in <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office with giant flying bogeys attacking him — ” “Yeah, but — ” “We were all in the D.A.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes met <PER>Ron</PER>’s.
in addition to himself, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius, him would not have picked <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, or Luna.
“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can’t fly,” said Luna in a dignified voice, “but they can, and <PER>Hagrid</PER> says they’re very good at finding places their riders are looking for.” <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around.
They tossed They's reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and <PER>Harry</PER> stretched out <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand eagerly and patted the nearest one’s shining neck.
“Is it those mad horse things?” said <PER>Ron</PER> uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the thestral <PER>Harry</PER> was patting.
“Four, <PER>Hermione</PER>,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>, scowling.
“Look, you three” — <PER>Harry</PER> pointed at <PER>Neville</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna — “you’re not involved in this, you’re not — ” They burst into more protests.
“But unless we can find more thestrals you’re not going to be able — ” “Oh, more of them will come,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> confidently, who like <PER>Ron</PER> was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that <PER>Ginny</PER> was looking at the horses.
“What makes you think that?” “Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and <PER>Hermione</PER> are both covered in blood,” <PER>Hermione</PER> said coolly, “and we know <PER>Hagrid</PER> lures thestrals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the first place” <PER>Harry</PER> felt a soft tug on <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest thestral licking <PER>Harry</PER>'s sleeve, which was damp with Grawp’s blood.
“<PER>Ron</PER> and I will take these two and go ahead, and <PER>Hermione</PER> can stay here with you three and <PER>Hermione</PER>’ll attract more thestrals — ” “I’m not staying behind!” said <PER>Hermione</PER> furiously.
He had no excuse now “All right,” He said angrily, “pick one and get on, then.” <PER>Harry</PER> wound <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand tightly into the mane of the nearest thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby, and scrambled clumsily onto the horse’s silken back.
<PER>Neville</PER> had heaved <PER>Neville</PER> over the back of the next thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature’s back.
<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, openmouthed and staring.
“When we can’t see the things?” “Oh it’s easy,” said Luna, sliding obligingly from her thestral and marching over to him, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Ginny</PER>.
Then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended, the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast and so steeply that <PER>Harry</PER> had to clench <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backward over its bony rump.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not think <PER>Harry</PER> had ever moved so fast: The thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating.
The cooling air was slapping <PER>Harry</PER>’s face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, <PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s five fellows soaring along behind <PER>Harry</PER>, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of them's thestral to protect them from its slipstream.
In the falling darkness <PER>Harry</PER> saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills “This is bizarre!” <PER>Harry</PER> heard <PER>Ron</PER> yell from somewhere behind him, and him imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support Twilight fell: The sky turned to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon it was only the lights of Muggle towns that gave them any clue of how far from the ground them were or how very fast them were traveling.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s arms were wrapped tightly around <PER>Harry</PER>'s horse’s neck as <PER>Harry</PER> willed it to go even faster.
All <PER>Harry</PER> knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as <PER>Voldemort</PER> wanted, nor died, for <PER>Voldemort</PER> was convinced that either outcome would cause <PER>Voldemort</PER> to feel <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s jubilation or fury course through <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own body, making <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Arthur was attacked On they flew through the gathering darkness; <PER>Harry</PER>’s face felt stiff and cold, <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs numb from gripping the thestral’s sides so tightly, but <PER>Harry</PER> did not dare shift positions lest <PER>Harry</PER> slip <PER>Harry</PER> was deaf from the thundering in <PER>Harry</PER>'s ears and <PER>Harry</PER>'s mouth was dry and frozen from the rush of cold night air.
<PER>Harry</PER> had lost all sense of how far they had come; all <PER>Harry</PER>'s faith was in the beast below <PER>Harry</PER>, still streaking purposefully through the night, barely flapping its wings as its sped ever onward If they were too late <PER>Harry</PER>’s still alive, <PER>Harry</PER>’s still fighting, I can feel it If <PER>Voldemort</PER> decided Sirius was not going to crack I’d know <PER>Harry</PER>’s stomach gave a jolt.
<PER>Harry</PER> gripped the thestral with every last ounce of <PER>Harry</PER>'s strength, braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and <PER>Harry</PER> slid from <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, looking around at the street where the overflowing dumpster still stood a short way from the vandalized telephone box, both drained of color in the flat orange glare of the streetlights.
“Never, ever again that was the worst — ” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> touched down on either side of him.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> marched in obediently; <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna squashed <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna in after <PER>Neville</PER>, and Luna; <PER>Harry</PER> took one glance back at the thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the dumpster, then forced <PER>Harry</PER> into the box after Luna.
<PER>Hermione</PER> scooped them up and handed them mutely to <PER>Harry</PER> over <PER>Ginny</PER> ’s head; he glanced at the topmost one.
“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.” “Fine!” <PER>Harry</PER> said loudly, as <PER>Harry</PER>'s scar gave another throb.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees and held <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand as ready as <PER>Harry</PER> could in such cramped conditions, peering through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed to be completely empty.
The door of the telephone box burst open; <PER>Harry</PER> toppled out of it, followed by <PER>Neville</PER> and Luna.
“Come on,” said <PER>Harry</PER> quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall, <PER>Harry</PER> in the lead, past the fountain, toward the desk where the security man who had weighed <PER>Harry</PER>’s wand had sat and which was now deserted.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt sure that there ought to be a security person there, sure that their absence was an ominous sign, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the day that <PER>Harry</PER> had come with Arthur — <PER>Harry</PER> was sure that the din would raise every security person within the building, yet when the lift halted, the cool female voice said, “Department of Mysteries,” and the grilles slid open again, they stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of air from the lift.
After months and months of dreaming about it, <PER>Harry</PER> was here at last “Let’s go,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered, and <PER>Harry</PER> led the way down the corridor, Luna right behind him, gazing around with her mouth slightly open.
“Maybe maybe a couple of people should stay here as a — as a lookout, and — ” “And how’re we going to let you know something’s coming?” asked <PER>Ginny</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>'s eyebrows raised.
“You could be miles away.” “We’re coming with you, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> still did not want to take them all with <PER>Harry</PER>, but it seemed <PER>Harry</PER> had no choice.
Just as it had in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dream, it swung open and <PER>Harry</PER> marched forward, leading the others over the threshold.
<PER>Harry</PER> regretted giving this order the moment <PER>Neville</PER> had obeyed this order.
<PER>Hermione</PER> grabbed <PER>Harry</PER>’s arm as though frightened the floor might move too, but it did not.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all <PER>Harry</PER> could see.
<PER>Harry</PER> realized at once that she was right: <PER>Harry</PER> could no sooner have picked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-black floor.
“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” said <PER>Harry</PER> forcefully, blinking to try and erase the blue lines from <PER>Harry</PER>'s vision, and clutching <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand tighter than ever.
“We won’t need to get out till We’ve found Sirius — ” “Don’t go calling for <PER>Harry</PER>, though!” <PER>Hermione</PER> said urgently, but <PER>Harry</PER> had never needed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s advice less; <PER>Harry</PER>'s instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for the time being.
“Where do we go, then, <PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked.
After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter, though there were no glittering, shimmering lights such as <PER>Harry</PER> had seen in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dreams.
<PER>Harry</PER> scrambled down the benches one by one until <PER>Harry</PER> reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit.
<PER>Harry</PER> footsteps echoed loudly as <PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly toward the dais.
The pointed archway looked much taller from where <PER>Harry</PER> stood now than when <PER>Harry</PER> had been looking down on it from above.
“Sirius?” <PER>Harry</PER> spoke again, but much more quietly now that <PER>Harry</PER> was nearer.
Gripping <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand very tightly, <PER>Harry</PER> edged around the dais, but there was nobody there.
“This isn’t right, <PER>Harry</PER>, come on, let’s go” She sounded scared, much more scared than She had in the room where the brains swam, yet <PER>Harry</PER> thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it, old though it was.
The gently rippling veil intrigued <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, let’s go, okay?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> more forcefully.
“Nobody’s talking, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now moving over to him.
“Is that you, <PER>Ron</PER>?” “I’m here, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, appearing around the side of the archway.
“Can’t anyone else hear it?” <PER>Harry</PER> demanded, for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put it there, <PER>Harry</PER> found <PER>Harry</PER>'s foot was on the dais.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to — well, come on, then!” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> led the way back around the dais.
On the other side, <PER>Ginny</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil too.
Without speaking, <PER>Hermione</PER> took hold of <PER>Ginny</PER>’s arm, <PER>Ron</PER> <PER>Neville</PER>’s, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door.
“What d’you reckon that arch was?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER> as they regained the dark circular room.
“It’s locked ” said <PER>Harry</PER>, throwing <PER>Harry</PER>'s weight at the door, but it did not budge.
“This is it, then, isn’t it?” said <PER>Ron</PER> excitedly, joining <PER>Harry</PER> in the attempt to force the door open.
<PER>Hermione</PER> pointed <PER>Hermione</PER>'s wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said, “Alohomora\” Nothing happened.
“Sirius’s knife!” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> pulled it out from inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall.
What was more, when <PER>Harry</PER> looked down at the knife, <PER>Harry</PER> saw that the blade had melted.
“It can’t be, <PER>Harry</PER> could get through all the doors in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dream,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, marking the door with another fiery cross as <PER>Harry</PER> replaced the now-useless handle of Sirius’s knife in <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket.
“Something blibbering, no doubt,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> under <PER>Hermione</PER>'s breath, and <PER>Neville</PER> gave a nervous little laugh.
As <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes became more accustomed to the brilliant glare <PER>Harry</PER> saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfather and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching footsteps.
“This way!” <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart was pumping frantically now that <PER>Harry</PER> knew they were on the right track.
<PER>Harry</PER> led the way forward down the narrow space between the lines of the desks, heading, as <PER>Harry</PER> had done in <PER>Harry</PER>'s dream, for the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as <PER>Harry</PER> was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering wind.
“Keep going!” said <PER>Harry</PER> sharply, because <PER>Ginny</PER> showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg’s progress back into a bird.
“This is it,” <PER>Harry</PER> said again, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was now pumping so hard and fast <PER>Harry</PER> felt it must interfere with <PER>Harry</PER>'s speech.
“Anywhere here really close ” “<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> tentatively, but “<PER>Harry</PER>?
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” said <PER>Hermione</PER> again.
This was where <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>, had seen <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down them.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Ron</PER> called.
“What?” He did not want to hear what <PER>Ron</PER> had to say, did not want to hear <PER>Ron</PER> tell He He had been stupid, or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts.
“What?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, but eagerly this time — it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there, a clue — he strode back to where they were all standing, a little way down row ninety-seven, but found nothing except <PER>Ron</PER> staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelves.
<PER>Harry</PER> Potter <PER>Harry</PER> stared at it.
“None of the rest of us are here” “<PER>Harry</PER>, I don’t think you should touch it,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> sharply, as he stretched out his hand.
“It’s something to do with me, isn’t it?” “Don’t, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> suddenly.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s looked as though <PER>Neville</PER>’s could not take much more suspense.
And feeling slightly reckless, <PER>Harry</PER> closed <PER>Harry</PER>'s fingers around the dusty ball’s surface.
The others moved in closer around <PER>Harry</PER>, gazing at the orb as <PER>Harry</PER> brushed it free of the clogging dust.
“To me, Potter,” repeated the drawling voice of <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> as <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> held out <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s hand, palm up.
A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to <PER>Harry</PER>’s left said triumphantly, “The Dark Lord always knows!” “Always,” echoed <PER>Malfoy</PER> softly.
the woman and the woman's fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from <PER>Harry</PER> and the others, the light from their wands dazzling <PER>Harry</PER>’s eyes.
“You’ve got him,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, ignoring the rising panic in <PER>Harry</PER>'s chest, the dread <PER>Harry</PER> had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Ron</PER> stir beside him.
“Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.” “Go on, then,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, raising <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand to chest height.
As he did so, the five wands of <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, <PER>Neville</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna rose on either side of him.
“Very well, then — ” “I TOLD YOU, NO!” <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> roared at the woman.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s arm was pressed against <PER>Neville</PER>’s, and <PER>Neville</PER>’s could feel <PER>Neville</PER>’s shaking.
<PER>Neville</PER>’s could feel one of the other’s quickened breath on the back of <PER>Neville</PER>’s's head.
“You jest, <PER>Harry</PER> Potter.” “Nope, not jesting,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape.
“Yeah,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, maintaining <PER>Harry</PER>'s tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I’m not playing games,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, half <PER>Harry</PER>'s mind on the conversation, half on <PER>Harry</PER>'s wandering foot.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER> sneeringly.
“I — what?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> quite forgot <PER>Harry</PER>'s plan.
“What about my scar?” “ What?” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER> more urgently behind <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Can this be?” said <PER>Malfoy</PER>, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of some of the Death Eaters's laughter, <PER>Harry</PER> hissed to <PER>Hermione</PER>, moving <PER>Harry</PER>'s lips as little as possible, “Smash shelves — ” “<PER>Dumbledore</PER> never told you?” <PER>Malfoy</PER> repeated.
“Well, this explains why you didn’t come earlier, Potter, <PER>the Dark Lord</PER> wondered why — ” “ — when I say go — ” “ — you didn’t come running when <PER>the Dark Lord</PER> showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams.
“Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as <PER>the Dark Lord</PER> discovered when <PER>the Dark Lord</PER> attempted to use others to steal it for him.” “And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?” “About both of you, Potter, about both of you Haven’t you ever wondered why <PER>Voldemort</PER> tried to kill you as a baby?” <PER>Harry</PER> stared into the slitted eyeholes through which <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s gray eyes were gleaming.
Was this prophecy the reason <PER>Harry</PER>’s parents had died, the reason <PER>Harry</PER> carried <PER>Harry</PER>'s lightning-bolt scar?
“Someone made a prophecy about <PER>Voldemort</PER> and me?” Someone said quietly, gazing at <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Someone's fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in Someone's hand.
“But <PER>Voldemort</PER> knows you are not unintell — ” “NOW!” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>.
The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, pearly-white figures's voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor — “RUN!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above, <PER>Harry</PER> seized a handful of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s robes and dragged <PER>Hermione</PER>'s forward, one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them.
They were all yelling, there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres — <PER>Harry</PER> found the way ahead clear and saw <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear footsteps right behind him and <PER>Hermione</PER>’s voice urging <PER>Neville</PER> on.
The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead, <PER>Harry</PER> could see the glittering light of the bell jar, <PER>Harry</PER> pelted through the glittering light of the bell jar, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them — “ Colloportus\” gasped <PER>Hermione</PER> and the door sealed “ Colloportus\” with an odd squelching noise.
He had thought that <PER>Ron</PER>, Luna, and <PER>Ginny</PER> had been ahead of them, that them would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there.
“They must have gone the wrong way!” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>, terror in <PER>Hermione</PER>'s face.
<PER>Harry</PER> put <PER>Harry</PER>'s ear close to the door to listen and heard <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER> roar: “Leave Nott, leave <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I say, <PER>Voldemort</PER> will not care for Nott’s injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson, come back here, we need to organize!
They were almost there when <PER>Harry</PER> heard something large and heavy collide with the door <PER>Hermione</PER> had charmed shut.
“Alohomora\” As the door flew open, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> dived under desks.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters’ robes drawing nearer, <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>'s feet moving rapidly.
Poking <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand out from under the desk <PER>Harry</PER> shouted, A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; <PER>Harry</PER> fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked a grandfather clock over.
The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid <PER>Harry</PER>’s spell and now pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand at <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim.
“Avada — ” <PER>Harry</PER> launched Avada — ” <PER>Harry</PER> across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing Avada — ” <PER>Harry</PER> to topple and Avada — ” <PER>Harry</PER>'s aim to go awry.
<PER>Neville</PER> overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, “EXPELLIARMUS\” Both <PER>Harry</PER>’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of Both <PER>Harry</PER>’s and the Death Eater’s wands's hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to both's feet and charged after both, the Death Eater in front and <PER>Harry</PER> hot on <PER>Harry</PER>'s heels, <PER>Neville</PER> bringing up the rear, plainly horrors truck at what <PER>Neville</PER> had done.
“Get out of the way, <PER>Harry</PER>!” yelled <PER>Neville</PER>, clearly determined to repair the damage.
<PER>Harry</PER> flung <PER>Harry</PER> sideways as <PER>Neville</PER> took aim again and shouted, “ STUPEFY !” The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater’s shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses.
<PER>Harry</PER> ducked down behind another desk as the man turned — his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, “STUP — “STUPEFY]” screamed <PER>Hermione</PER>, who had just caught up with them.
<PER>Harry</PER> expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor, but instead, <PER>Harry</PER>'s head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and <PER>Harry</PER> came to rest, sprawled on <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on the table, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and her threw it to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>!” <PER>Hermione</PER> screamed.
<PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand but to <PER>Harry</PER>'s amazement <PER>Hermione</PER> seized his arm.
<PER>Harry</PER> could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and knew, too late, that <PER>Harry</PER> ought not to have shouted and given away their position.
“Collo — ” began <PER>Hermione</PER>, but before <PER>Hermione</PER> could complete the spell the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside.
With a cry of triumph, both yelled, “ IMPEDIMENT A\” <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> were all knocked backward off their feet.
<PER>Neville</PER> was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view, <PER>Hermione</PER> smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head slammed into the stone wall behind <PER>Harry</PER>, tiny lights burst in front of <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, and for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> was too dizzy and bewildered to react.
“WEVE GOT HIM!” yelled the Death Eater nearest <PER>Harry</PER>, “IN AN OFFICE OFF — ” “ Silenciol ” cried <PER>Hermione</PER>, and the man’s voice was extinguished.
It passed right across <PER>Hermione</PER>’s chest; the Death Eater <PER>Hermione</PER> gave a tiny “oh!” as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where the Death Eater <PER>Hermione</PER> lay motionless.
<PER>Harry</PER> fell to <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees beside her as <PER>Neville</PER> crawled rapidly toward her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of his.
The Death Eater kicked out hard at <PER>Neville</PER>’s head as The Death Eater emerged — The Death Eater's foot broke <PER>Neville</PER>’s wand in two and connected with his face — <PER>Neville</PER> gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching — <PER>Neville</PER>'s mouth and nose.
<PER>Harry</PER> twisted around, <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand held high, and saw that The Death Eater had ripped off <PER>Harry</PER>'s mask and was pointing his wand directly at <PER>Harry</PER>, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts.
With his free hand, his pointed from the prophecy still clutched in <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand, to <PER>Harry</PER>, then at <PER>Hermione</PER>.
A whine of panic inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s head was preventing <PER>Harry</PER> thinking properly.
<PER>Harry</PER> had one hand on <PER>Hermione</PER>’s shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s properly.
Don’t let her be dead, don’t let her be dead, it’s my fault if her’s dead “Whaddever you do, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Neville</PER> fiercely from under the desk, lowering <PER>Neville</PER>'s hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, “don’d gib it to his!” Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around his.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>,” <PER>Harry</PER> said at once, shaking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again.
“<PER>Hermione</PER>, wake up” “Whaddid “Whaddid do to <PER>Hermione</PER>?” said <PER>Neville</PER>, crawling out from under the desk again to kneel at <PER>Hermione</PER>'s other side, blood streaming from “Whaddid's rapidly swelling nose.
“I dunno” <PER>Neville</PER> groped for <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wrist.
“Dat’s a pulse, <PER>Harry</PER>, I’b sure id is” Such a powerful wave of relief swept through <PER>Harry</PER> that for a moment <PER>Harry</PER> felt light-headed.
“She’s alive?” “Yeah, I dink so” There was a pause in which <PER>Harry</PER> listened hard for the sounds of more footsteps, but all <PER>Harry</PER> could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby Death Eater in the next room.
“<PER>Neville</PER>, we’re not far from the exit,” <PER>Harry</PER> whispered.
“We’re right next to that circular room If we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I’ll bet you can get <PER>Hermione</PER> up the corridor and into the lift Then you could find someone Raise the alarm ” “And whad are you going do do?” said <PER>Neville</PER>, mopping <PER>Neville</PER>'s bleeding nose with <PER>Neville</PER>'s sleeve and frowning at <PER>Harry</PER>.
“But <PER>Hermione</PER> — ” “We’ll dake her wid us,” said <PER>Neville</PER> firmly.
“I’ll carry her — you’re bedder at fighding dem dan I ab — ” He stood up and seized one of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s arms, glared at <PER>Harry</PER>, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist <PER>Hermione</PER>’s limp form over <PER>Neville</PER>’s shoulders.
“Wait,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, snatching up <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand from the floor and shoving it into <PER>Neville</PER>s hand, “you’d better take this” <PER>Neville</PER> kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly toward the door.
“My gran’s going do kill be,” said <PER>Neville</PER> thickly, blood spattering from his nose as his spoke, “dat was by dad’s old wand” <PER>Harry</PER> stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously.
They walked a few steps forward, <PER>Neville</PER> tottering slightly due to <PER>Hermione</PER>’s weight.
The recent blow on the back of <PER>Harry</PER>’s head seemed to have unsteadied <PER>Harry</PER>; <PER>Harry</PER> narrowed <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again.
With a sinking heart <PER>Harry</PER> saw that <PER>Hermione</PER>’s fiery crosses had faded from the doors.
“<PER>Ron</PER>!” croaked <PER>Harry</PER>, dashing toward them.
“<PER>Ginny</PER> — are you all — ?” “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes and gazing at <PER>Harry</PER> with unfocused eyes.
“There you are Ha ha ha You look funny, <PER>Harry</PER> You’re all messed up <PER>Ron</PER>’s face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth.
“What happened?” But <PER>Ginny</PER> shook <PER>Ginny</PER>'s head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle.
“Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very odd place, some of the time us were just floating in the dark — ” “<PER>Harry</PER>, we saw Uranus up close!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, still giggling feebly.
“Anyway, one of them grabbed <PER>Ginny</PER>’s foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but ” Luna gestured hopelessly at <PER>Ginny</PER>, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed.
“And what about <PER>Ron</PER>?” said <PER>Harry</PER> fearfully, as <PER>Ron</PER> continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of <PER>Harry</PER>’s robes.
“I don’t know what they hit him with,” said Luna sadly, “but him’s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all” “<PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER>’s ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, “you know who this girl is, <PER>Harry</PER>?
“Luna, can you help <PER>Ginny</PER>?” “Yes,” said Luna, sticking Luna's wand behind Luna's ear for safekeeping, putting an arm around <PER>Ginny</PER>’s waist and pulling <PER>Ginny</PER>'s up.
“It’s only my ankle, I can do it myself!” said <PER>Ginny</PER> impatiently, but next moment <PER>Ginny</PER> had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support.
<PER>Harry</PER> pulled <PER>Ron</PER>’s arm over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder just as, so many months ago, <PER>Harry</PER> had pulled <PER>Dudley</PER>’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around: They had a one-in-twelve chance of getting the exit right the first time — <PER>Harry</PER> heaved <PER>Ron</PER> toward a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped into the hall, led by Bellatrix Lestrange.
Stunning Spells shot across the room: <PER>Harry</PER> smashed <PER>Harry</PER>'s way through the door ahead, flung <PER>Ron</PER> unceremoniously from <PER>Harry</PER>, and ducked back to help <PER>Neville</PER> in with <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“ Colloportus\” shouted <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side.
“Luna — <PER>Neville</PER> — help me!” The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as them went: <PER>Harry</PER> crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in <PER>Harry</PER>'s haste to reach the next door.
Luna and <PER>Neville</PER> were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall — then, as <PER>Harry</PER> reached the very top of the room, <PER>Harry</PER> heard Luna cry, “Collo — aaaaaaaaargh <PER>Harry</PER> turned in time to see her flying through the air.
<PER>Harry</PER> dodged her and sprinted back up the room; <PER>Harry</PER> was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy — “Hey!” said <PER>Ron</PER>, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward <PER>Harry</PER>, giggling.
“Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn’t that weird, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “<PER>Ron</PER>, get out of the way, get down — ” But “<PER>Ron</PER> had already pointed his wand at the tank.
<PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER> and each of the Death Eaters to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish.
For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared toward <PER>Ron</PER>, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film — “Ha ha ha, <PER>Harry</PER>, look at it — ” said <PER>Ron</PER>, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, come and touch it, bet it’s weird — ” <PER>Harry</PER> did not know what would happen if <PER>Ron</PER> touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but <PER>Harry</PER> was sure it would not be anything good.
<PER>Harry</PER> darted forward but <PER>Ron</PER> had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, look what’s happen — no — no, I don’t like it — no, stop — stop — ” But the thin ribbons were spinning around <PER>Ron</PER>’s chest now.
<PER>Harry</PER> tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against <PER>Harry</PER> like an octopus’s body.
“Diffindol” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around <PER>Ron</PER> before his eyes, but they would not break.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, it’ll suffocate <PER>Harry</PER>!” screamed <PER>Ginny</PER>, immobilized by <PER>Ginny</PER>'s broken ankle on the floor — then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater’s wands and hit her squarely in the face.
“ STUBEFYl” shouted <PER>Neville</PER>, wheeling around and waving <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand at the oncoming Death Eaters.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> that left craters in the wall behind <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange sprinted right at <PER>Harry</PER>.
Inwardly praying that <PER>Neville</PER> would stay with <PER>Ron</PER> — find some way of releasing him — <PER>Neville</PER> ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish — <PER>Neville</PER> was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of <PER>Neville</PER>'s body, — <PER>Neville</PER> landed flat on — <PER>Neville</PER>'s back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on the stone archway dais.
<PER>Harry</PER> got to <PER>Harry</PER>'s feet though <PER>Harry</PER>'s legs were trembling so badly they barely supported <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Potter, your race is run,” drawled <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, pulling off his mask.
“You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,” said <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>, his pale face flushed with pleasure.
<PER>Neville</PER> was scrambling down the stone benches toward them, <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand held fast in <PER>Neville</PER>'s trembling hand.
“<PER>Neville</PER> — no — go back to <PER>Ron</PER> — ” “STUBEFYl” <PER>Neville</PER> shouted again, pointing <PER>Neville</PER>'s wand at each Death Eater in turn, “STUBEFYl.
“It’s Longbottom, isn’t it?” sneered <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
She looked transported, alive with excitement as She glanced at <PER>Harry</PER>, then back at <PER>Neville</PER>.
the prophecy was hot with the heat from <PER>Harry</PER>'s clutching hand as <PER>Harry</PER> held it out.
The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as them jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, <PER>Harry</PER> could see <PER>Neville</PER> crawling along.
<PER>Harry</PER> dodged another jet of red light and flung <PER>Harry</PER> flat on the ground to reach <PER>Neville</PER>.
“And <PER>Ron</PER>?” “I dink he’s all right — he was still fighding the brain when I left — ” The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where <PER>Neville</PER>’s hand had been seconds before.
Both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized <PER>Harry</PER> around the neck and pulled <PER>Harry</PER> upright, so that <PER>Harry</PER>'s toes were barely touching the floor.
Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix — nobody seemed to realize that <PER>Harry</PER> was dying <PER>Harry</PER> turned his wand backward toward The man’s side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man’s free hand was groping toward the hand in which <PER>Harry</PER> was grasping the prophecy — <PER>Neville</PER> had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a spell, — <PER>Neville</PER> had jabbed <PER>Hermione</PER>’s wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater’s mask.
The man relinquished <PER>Harry</PER> at once with a howl of pain and <PER>Harry</PER> whirled around to face him and gasped, The Death Eater keeled over backward and The Death Eater's mask slipped off.
“Thanks!” <PER>Harry</PER> said to <PER>Neville</PER>, pulling <PER>Harry</PER> aside as Sirius and <PER>Harry</PER>'s Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs.
Then <PER>Harry</PER>’s foot made contact with something round and hard and <PER>Harry</PER>’s slipped — for a moment <PER>Harry</PER>’s thought <PER>Harry</PER>’s had dropped the prophecy, then saw Moody’s magic eye spinning away across the floor.
Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER>: Dolohov, Dolohov's long pale face twisted with glee.
“Now, Potter — ” Potter — made the same slashing movement with Potter —'s wand that he had used on <PER>Hermione</PER> just as <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “Protego\” <PER>Harry</PER> felt something streak across <PER>Harry</PER>'s face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and him fell over <PER>Neville</PER>’s jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.
The prophecy had again flown to the tips of <PER>Harry</PER>’s fingers but <PER>Harry</PER> had managed to cling to it.
Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand tips — Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, take the prophecy, grab <PER>Neville</PER>, and run!” Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across <PER>Harry</PER>'s field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew over <PER>Harry</PER>’s head as <PER>Harry</PER> launched <PER>Harry</PER> toward <PER>Neville</PER> — “Can you stand?” he bellowed in <PER>Neville</PER>’s ear, as <PER>Neville</PER>’s legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably.
“Put your arm round my neck — ” <PER>Neville</PER> did so — <PER>Harry</PER> heaved — <PER>Neville</PER>’s legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them.
Both fell backward, <PER>Neville</PER>’s legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle’s, <PER>Harry</PER> with <PER>Harry</PER>'s left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed.
“The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!” snarled <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s voice in <PER>Lucius</PER> <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s's ear, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt the tip of <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s wand pressing hard between <PER>Harry</PER>'s ribs.
“No — get — off — me <PER>Neville</PER> — catch it!” <PER>Harry</PER> flung the prophecy across the floor, <PER>Neville</PER> spun <PER>Neville</PER> around on <PER>Neville</PER>'s back and scooped the ball to his chest.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> pointed the wand instead at <PER>Neville</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> jabbed his own wand back over <PER>Harry</PER>'s shoulder and yelled, “Impedimental” <PER>Malfoy</PER> was blasted off his back.
As <PER>Harry</PER> scrambled up again <PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw <PER>Malfoy</PER> smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling.
<PER>Malfoy</PER> aimed <PER>Malfoy</PER>'s wand at <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Neville</PER> again, but before <PER>Malfoy</PER> could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, round up the others and GO!” <PER>Harry</PER> seized <PER>Neville</PER> by the shoulder of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone steps.
<PER>Harry</PER> heaved again with all the strength <PER>Harry</PER> possessed and they climbed another step A spell hit the stone bench at <PER>Harry</PER>’s heel.
It crumbled away and <PER>Harry</PER> fell back to the step below: <PER>Neville</PER> sank to the ground, <PER>Neville</PER>'s legs still jerking and thrashing, and thrust the prophecy into <PER>Neville</PER>'s pocket.
“Come on!” said <PER>Harry</PER> desperately, hauling at <PER>Neville</PER>’s robes.
“Just try and push with your legs — ” <PER>Harry</PER> gave another stupendous heave and <PER>Neville</PER>’s robes tore all along the left seam — the small spun-glass ball dropped from <PER>Harry</PER>'s pocket and before either of them could catch it, one of <PER>Neville</PER>’s floundering feet kicked it.
<PER>Harry</PER> could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could <PER>Harry</PER> hear.
“<PER>Harry</PER>, I’b sorry!” cried <PER>Neville</PER>, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder, “I’b so sorry, <PER>Harry</PER>, I didn’d bean do — ■” “It doesn’t matter!” <PER>Harry</PER> shouted.
“Just try and stand, let’s get out of — ” “ Dubbledorel” said <PER>Neville</PER>, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over <PER>Harry</PER>’s shoulder.
“What?” <PER>Harry</PER> turned to look where <PER>Neville</PER> was staring.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of <PER>Harry</PER>'s body — they were saved.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sped down the steps past <PER>Neville</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER>, who had no more thought of leaving.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was there.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s spell pulled <PER>Dumbledore</PER> back as easily and effortlessly as though <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had hooked <PER>Dumbledore</PER> with an invisible line — Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival.
<PER>Harry</PER> saw Sirius duck Bellatrix’s jet of red light: <PER>Harry</PER> was laughing at her.
<PER>Harry</PER> released <PER>Neville</PER>, though <PER>Harry</PER> was unaware of doing so.
<PER>Harry</PER> was jumping down the steps again, pulling out <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned to the dais too.
His body curved in a graceful arc as His sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch And <PER>Harry</PER> saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather’s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place.
<PER>Harry</PER> heard Bellatrix Lestrange’s triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing — Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, <PER>Harry</PER> would reappear from the other side any second But — Sirius did not reappear.
“SIRIUS!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled, “SIRIUS!” <PER>Harry</PER> had reached the floor, <PER>Harry</PER>'s breath coming in searing gasps.
Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, <PER>Harry</PER>, would pull him back out again But as him reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin grabbed <PER>Harry</PER> around the chest, holding <PER>Harry</PER> back.
“There’s nothing you can do, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “Get him, save him, him’s only just gone through!” “It’s too late, <PER>Harry</PER> — ” “We can still reach him — ” <PER>Harry</PER> struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go “There’s nothing you can do, <PER>Harry</PER> nothing <PER>Harry</PER>’s gone.” “<PER>Harry</PER> hasn’t gone!” <PER>Harry</PER> yelled.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not believe it, <PER>Harry</PER> would not believe it; still <PER>Harry</PER> fought Lupin with every bit of strength <PER>Harry</PER> had: Lupin did not understand, people hid behind that curtain, Lupin had heard people whispering the first time Lupin had entered the room — Sirius was hiding, simply lurking out of sight — “SIRIUS!” SIRIUS!
To <PER>Harry</PER> it was meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered except that Lupin stop pretending that Sirius, who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain, was not going to emerge at any moment, shaking back <PER>Harry</PER>'s dark hair and eager to reenter the battle — Lupin dragged <PER>Harry</PER> away from the dais, <PER>Harry</PER> still staring at the archway, angry at Sirius now for keeping <PER>Harry</PER> waiting — But some part of <PER>Harry</PER> realized, even as <PER>Harry</PER> fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept <PER>Harry</PER> waiting before Sirius had risked everything, always, to see <PER>Harry</PER>, to help <PER>Harry</PER> If Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when <PER>Harry</PER> was yelling for <PER>Harry</PER> as though <PER>Harry</PER>'s life depended on it, the only possible explanation was that he could not come back That he really was <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room, seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes.
“<PER>Harry</PER>?” <PER>Neville</PER> had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where <PER>Harry</PER> stood.
<PER>Harry</PER> was no longer struggling against Lupin, who maintained a precautionary grip on <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm nevertheless.
“<PER>Harry</PER> I’b really sorry” said <PER>Neville</PER>.
her was halfway up the steps now — “<PER>Harry</PER> — no!” cried Lupin, but <PER>Harry</PER> had already ripped <PER>Harry</PER>'s arm from Lupin’s slackened grip.
he leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past <PER>Ginny</PER>, who said, “<PER>Harry</PER> — what — ?” past <PER>Ron</PER>, who giggled feebly, and <PER>Hermione</PER>, who was still unconscious.
The doors slid shut and <PER>Harry</PER> was rising <PER>Harry</PER> forced <PER>Harry</PER>'s way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around.
“Aaaaaah did you love him, little baby Potter?” Hatred rose in <PER>Harry</PER> such as <PER>Harry</PER> had never known before.
“I was and am <PER>the Dark Lord</PER>’s most loyal servant, I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete — ” “Stupefy\” yelled <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Give me the prophecy — roll it out toward me now — and I may spare your life!” “Well, you’re going to have to kill me, because it’s gone!” <PER>Harry</PER> roared — and as <PER>Harry</PER> shouted it, pain seared across <PER>Harry</PER>'s forehead.
<PER>Harry</PER> scar was on fire again, and <PER>Harry</PER> felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with <PER>Harry</PER>'s own rage.
<PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes.
Tall, thin, and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupiled eyes staring Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at <PER>Harry</PER> who stood frozen, quite unable to move.
“So you smashed my prophecy?” said <PER>Voldemort</PER> softly, staring at <PER>Harry</PER> with those pitiless red eyes.
“No, Bella, <PER>Harry</PER> is not lying I see the truth looking at me from within <PER>Harry</PER>'s worthless mind Months of preparation, months of effort and my Death Eaters have let <PER>Harry</PER> Potter thwart me again” “Master, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus Black!” sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s feet as he paced slowly nearer.
But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between <PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
And then he breathed, “<PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” <PER>Harry</PER> looked behind <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart pounding.
<PER>Voldemort</PER> raised <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s wand and sent another jet of green light at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak; next second he had reappeared behind <PER>Voldemort</PER> and waved his wand toward the remnants of the fountain; the other statues sprang to life too.
The headless statue thrust <PER>Harry</PER> backward, away from the fight, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> advanced on <PER>Voldemort</PER> and the golden centaur cantered around them both.
The force of the spell that emanated from it was such that <PER>Harry</PER>, though shielded by <PER>Harry</PER>'s stone guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed, and this time <PER>Voldemort</PER> was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect a shining silver shield.
The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gonglike note reverberated from it, an oddly chilling sound “You do not seek to kill me, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” called <PER>Voldemort</PER>, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield.
“Above such brutality, are you?” “We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said calmly, continuing to walk toward <PER>Voldemort</PER> as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s stroll up the hall.
“Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit — ” “There is nothing worse than death, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” snarled <PER>Voldemort</PER>.
“You are quite wrong,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still closing in upon <PER>Voldemort</PER> and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt scared to see <PER>Harry</PER> walking along, undefended, shieldless.
<PER>Harry</PER> wanted to cry out a warning, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s headless guard kept shunting him backward toward the wall, blocking him's every attempt to get out from behind it.
This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had drawn back <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip.
For a moment, it seemed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold upon <PER>Voldemort</PER> at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike — There was a burst of flame in midair above <PER>Dumbledore</PER> just as <PER>Voldemort</PER> reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> from <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s wand and the snake had struck — Fawkes swooped down in front of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, opened — Fawkes's beak wide, and swallowed the jet of green light whole.
At the same moment, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> brandished <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand in one, long, fluid movement — the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; the water in the pool rose up and covered <PER>Voldemort</PER> like a cocoon of molten glass — For a few seconds <PER>Voldemort</PER> was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass — Then <PER>Voldemort</PER> was gone, and the water fell with a crash back into the water pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor.
Sure it was over, sure <PER>Voldemort</PER> had decided to flee, <PER>Harry</PER> made to run out from behind <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s statue guard, but <PER>Dumbledore</PER> bellowed, “Stay where you are, <PER>Harry</PER>!” For the first time, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> sounded frightened.
<PER>Harry</PER>’s knew <PER>Harry</PER>’s was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance — <PER>Harry</PER>’s was gone from The hall, <PER>Harry</PER>’s was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that <PER>Harry</PER> did not know where <PER>Harry</PER>'s body ended and the creature’s began.
They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape — And when the creature spoke, the creature used <PER>Harry</PER>’s mouth, so that in <PER>Harry</PER>'s agony <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s jaw move “ Kill me now, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>” Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, <PER>Harry</PER> felt the creature use <PER>Harry</PER> again “If death is nothing, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, kill the boy” Let the pain stop, thought <PER>Harry</PER>.
Let <PER>Harry</PER> kill us End it, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> Death is nothing compared to this And I’ll see Sirius again And as <PER>Harry</PER>’s heart filled with emotion, the creature’s coils loosened, the pain was gone, <PER>Harry</PER> was lying facedown on the floor, <PER>Harry</PER>'s glasses gone, shivering as though <PER>Harry</PER> lay upon ice, not wood And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than there should have been: <PER>Harry</PER> opened <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyes, saw his glasses lying at the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding <PER>Harry</PER>, but which now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile.
“Are you all right, <PER>Harry</PER>?” “Yes,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, shaking so violently <PER>Harry</PER> could not hold <PER>Harry</PER>'s head up properly.
As <PER>Dumbledore</PER> pulled him back to him's feet, <PER>Harry</PER> saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin leading a stunned-looking <PER>Cornelius</PER> Fudge forward.
“I saw <PER>Harry</PER>, Mister Fudge, I swear, it was <PER>Voldemort</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> grabbed a woman and Disapparated!” “I know, Williamson, I know, I saw <PER>Voldemort</PER> too!” gibbered Fudge, who was wearing pajamas under <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though <PER>Voldemort</PER> had just run miles.
“You — here — I — I — ” He looked wildly around at the Aurors He had brought with He, and it could not have been clearer that He was in half a mind to cry, “Seize He!” “<PER>Cornelius</PER>, I am ready to fight your men — and win again!” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> in a thunderous voice.
“We can discuss that after I have sent <PER>Harry</PER> back to Hogwarts,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Harry</PER> — <PER>Harry</PER> Potter?” Fudge spun around and stared at <PER>Harry</PER>, who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had been guarding him during <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s duel.
“Why — what’s all this about?” “I shall explain everything,” repeated <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “when <PER>Harry</PER> is back at school.” <PER>Harry</PER> walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard’s head lay on the floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> pointed <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand at it and muttered, “Portus.” The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more.
“Now see here, <PER>Dumbledore</PER>!” said Fudge, as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> picked up The head and walked back to <PER>Harry</PER> carrying it.
“You will give the order to remove Dolores <PER>Umbridge</PER> from Hogwarts,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I — you — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> turned <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s back on <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Take this Portkey, <PER>Harry</PER>.” He held out the golden head of the statue, and <PER>Harry</PER> placed He's hand upon it, past caring what He did next or where He went.
“One two three ” <PER>Harry</PER> felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s navel.
The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the Atrium, Fudge, and <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had all disappeared, and his was flying forward in a whirlwind of color and sound <PER>Harry</PER>’s feet hit solid ground again; <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees buckled a little and the golden wizard’s head fell with a resounding clunk to the floor.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked around and saw that <PER>Harry</PER> had arrived in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
If he, <PER>Harry</PER>, had not been stupid enough to fall for <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s trick, if <PER>Voldemort</PER> had not been so convinced that what <PER>Voldemort</PER> had seen in <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s dream was real, if <PER>Voldemort</PER> had only opened <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s mind to the possibility that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was, as <PER>Hermione</PER> had said, banking on <PER>Harry</PER>’s love of playing the hero It was unbearable, <PER>Harry</PER> would not think about it, <PER>Harry</PER> could not stand it There was a terrible hollow inside <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> did not want to feel or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had vanished.
<PER>Harry</PER> did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent space, <PER>Harry</PER> could not stand it — A picture behind <PER>Harry</PER> gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and a cool voice said, “Ah <PER>Harry</PER> Potter ” Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching <PER>Harry</PER>'s arms as <PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER> with shrewd, narrow eyes.
Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead, but <PER>Harry</PER> could not tell <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I hope this means,” said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk, “that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> will soon be back with us?” <PER>Harry</PER> turned.
<PER>Harry</PER> tugged again on the doorknob behind <PER>Harry</PER>'s back, but it remained immovable.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said comfortably.
<PER>Harry</PER> could not stand this, <PER>Harry</PER> could not stand being <PER>Harry</PER> anymore <PER>Harry</PER> had never felt more trapped inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s own head and body, never wished so intensely that <PER>Harry</PER> could be somebody — anybody — else The empty fireplace burst into emerald-green flame, making <PER>Harry</PER> leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> did not look at <PER>Harry</PER> at first, but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s robes, the tiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom <PER>Harry</PER> placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usually stood.
“Well, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, finally turning away from the baby bird, “you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night’s events.” <PER>Harry</PER> tried to say “Good,” but no sound came out.
It seemed to <PER>Harry</PER> that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was reminding <PER>Harry</PER> of the amount of damage <PER>Harry</PER> had caused by <PER>Harry</PER>'s actions tonight, and although <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was for once looking at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> directly, and though <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s expression was kindly rather than accusatory, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could not bear to meet <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes.
“Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. Mungo’s, but it seems that Madam Pomfrey will make a full recovery.” <PER>Harry</PER> contented <PER>Harry</PER> with nodding at the carpet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure that all the portraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word <PER>Dumbledore</PER> spoke, wondering where <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and <PER>Harry</PER> had been and why there had been injuries.
“I know how you are feeling, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> very quietly.
“No, you don’t,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice was suddenly loud and strong.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> knew nothing about <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s feelings.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s back on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and stared determinedly out of the opposite window.
Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy black dog, so <PER>Harry</PER> could watch <PER>Harry</PER> play <PER>Harry</PER> had probably come to see whether <PER>Harry</PER> was as good as James had been <PER>Harry</PER> had never asked <PER>Harry</PER> “There is no shame in what you are feeling, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s voice.
“On the contrary the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.” <PER>Harry</PER> felt the white-hot anger lick <PER>Harry</PER>'s insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling <PER>Harry</PER> with the desire to hurt <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for <PER>Harry</PER>'s calmness and <PER>Harry</PER>'s empty words.
“My greatest strength, is it?” said <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s voice shaking as <PER>Harry</PER> stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it.
He had not flinched or made a single move to stop <PER>Harry</PER> demolishing <PER>Harry</PER>'s office.
“You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.” “I — DONT!” <PER>Harry</PER> screamed, so loudly that <PER>Harry</PER> felt <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat might tear, and for a second <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to rush at <PER>Dumbledore</PER> and break him too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned back to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“I daresay I have too many.” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked around <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk and sat down behind it, watching <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Let me out,” <PER>Harry</PER> said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s.
<PER>Harry</PER> hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing <PER>Dumbledore</PER> ’s desk.
“Am I to understand,” said Phineas Nigellus slowly from <PER>Harry</PER>’s left, “that my great-great-grandson — the last of the Blacks — is dead?” “Yes, Phineas,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head in time to see Phineas marching out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place.
he would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, calling for Sirius through the house “<PER>Harry</PER>, I owe you an explanation,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“And this ability of yours — to detect <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s presence, even when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused — has become more and more pronounced since <PER>Voldemort</PER> returned to <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s own body and his full powers.” <PER>Harry</PER> did not bother to nod.
“More recently,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “I became concerned that <PER>Voldemort</PER> might realize that this connection between you exists.
“Professor <PER>Snape</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> corrected him quietly.
“I believed it could not be long before <PER>Voldemort</PER> attempted to force <PER>Voldemort</PER>'s way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to give <PER>Voldemort</PER> more incentives to do so.
“<PER>Voldemort</PER>’s aim in possessing you, as <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s demonstrated tonight, would not have been my destruction.
<PER>Harry</PER> was letting the words wash over <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, and now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside <PER>Harry</PER> that was the loss of Sirius, none of it mattered “Sirius told me that you felt <PER>Voldemort</PER> awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley’s attack.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill.
<PER>Harry</PER> could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s explanation.
Phineas Nigellus had still not returned “Professor <PER>Snape</PER> discovered,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> resumed, “that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months.
“I didn’t practice, I didn’t bother, I could’ve stopped myself having those dreams, <PER>Hermione</PER> kept telling me to do it, if I had he’d never have been able to show me where to go, and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t — ” Something was erupting inside <PER>Harry</PER>’s head: a need to justify himself, to explain — “I tried to check if he’d really taken Sirius, I went to <PER>Umbridge</PER>’s office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and he said — Sirius wasn’t there, he said he’d gone!” Kreacher lied,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> calmly.
“You are not <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s master, <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could lie to you without even needing to punish <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Dumbledore</PER> hasn’t been out of Grimmauld Place for years.” “Kreacher seized “Kreacher's opportunity shortly before Christmas,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to ‘get out.’ He took Sirius at He's word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house.
“You see, when you gave Professor <PER>Snape</PER> that cryptic warning, Professor <PER>Snape</PER> realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries.
“So when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night ” “The <PER>Malfoy</PER>s — undoubtedly on <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s instructions — had told <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER> must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured.
“But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I — persuaded He — to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.” “And,” whispered <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER>'s hands curled in cold fists on <PER>Harry</PER>'s knees, “and <PER>Hermione</PER> kept telling us to be nice to him — ” “She was quite right, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Kreacher ’s a lying — foul — Kreacher deserved — ” Kreacher is what Kreacher has been made by wizards, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
he was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, who had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered “What about <PER>Snape</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> spat.
“<PER>Snape</PER> — <PER>Snape</PER> g-goaded Sirius about staying in the house — he made out Sirius was a coward — ” “Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“<PER>Snape</PER> stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!” <PER>Harry</PER> snarled.
“<PER>Harry</PER> threw me out of <PER>Harry</PER>'s office!” “I am aware of it,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> heavily.
“I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to <PER>Voldemort</PER> while in my presence — ” “<PER>Snape</PER> made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him — ” <PER>Harry</PER> remembered <PER>Ron</PER>’s thoughts on the subject and plunged on.
“How do you know him wasn’t trying to soften me up for <PER>Voldemort</PER>, make it easier for <PER>Voldemort</PER> to get inside my — ” “I trust Severus <PER>Snape</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> simply.
“It’s okay for <PER>Snape</PER> to hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher?” “Sirius did not hate Kreacher,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“People don’t like being locked up!” <PER>Harry</PER> said furiously, rounding on <PER>Harry</PER>.
“You did it to me all last summer — ” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> closed <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s eyes and buried <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s face in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s long-fingered hands.
<PER>Harry</PER> watched <PER>Harry</PER>, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, did not soften <PER>Harry</PER>.
On the contrary, <PER>Harry</PER> felt even angrier that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> was showing signs of weakness.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no business being weak when <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to rage and storm at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> lowered <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s hands and surveyed <PER>Harry</PER> through <PER>Harry</PER>'s half-moon glasses.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at <PER>Harry</PER> and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, <PER>Harry</PER>, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended.
“She doesn’t give a damn — ” “But She took you,” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> cut across <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“Don’t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, why <PER>Voldemort</PER> had tried to kill you when you were a baby?” <PER>Harry</PER> nodded.
“Ought I to have told you then?” <PER>Harry</PER> stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but <PER>Harry</PER>'s heart was racing again.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office was bathed in <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s office.
The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments <PER>Harry</PER> had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind <PER>Harry</PER>, the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in the baby Fawkes's nest of ashes.
He bent down, slid back a catch, and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which <PER>Harry</PER> had seen <PER>Harry</PER>'s father tormenting <PER>Snape</PER>.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s wand to <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s own temple.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> sat back down behind <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s desk and watched <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment.
“The one with the power to vanquish <PER>Voldemort</PER> approaches Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies and <PER>the Dark Lord</PER> will mark him as him's equal, but him will have power <PER>Voldemort</PER> knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives The one with the power to vanquish <PER>Voldemort</PER> will be born as the seventh month dies” The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished.
Neither <PER>Dumbledore</PER> nor <PER>Harry</PER> nor any of the portraits made a sound.
“Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>?” <PER>Harry</PER> said very quietly, for Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought.
“It did that mean What did that mean?” “It meant,” said Professor <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, “that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago.
“It means — me?” <PER>Dumbledore</PER> surveyed <PER>Dumbledore</PER> for a moment through <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s glasses.
“It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that <PER>Voldemort</PER> could only have tried to kill you because <PER>Voldemort</PER> knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.” “Then — it might not be me?” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I am afraid,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, “that there is no doubt that it is you.” “But you said — <PER>Neville</PER> was born at the end of July too — and his mum and dad — ” “You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish <PER>Voldemort</PER> <PER>Voldemort</PER> himself would ‘mark him as him's equal.’ And so he did, <PER>Harry</PER>.
If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again, <PER>Harry</PER> asked, without caring much about the answer, “The end of the prophecy it was something about ‘neither can live’ ” “ ‘ while the other survives,’ ” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
“So,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him, “so does that mean that that one of us has got to kill the other one in the end?” “Yes,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER>.
Sirius seemed a million miles away already, even if a part of <PER>Harry</PER> still believed that if <PER>Harry</PER> had only pulled back that veil, <PER>Harry</PER> would have found Sirius looking back at <PER>Harry</PER>, greeting <PER>Harry</PER>, perhaps, with <PER>Harry</PER>'s laugh like a bark “I feel I owe you another explanation, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Dumbledore</PER> hesitantly.
Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived — “There you are, <PER>Harry</PER>, I knew they’d drag you into it somehow,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, looking over the top of the paper at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sitting on the end of <PER>Ron</PER>’s bed and they were both listening to <PER>Hermione</PER> read the front page of the Sunday Prophet.
<PER>Ginny</PER>, whose ankle had been mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of <PER>Hermione</PER>’s bed; <PER>Neville</PER>, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was reading the magazine upside down and apparently not taking in a word <PER>Hermione</PER> was saying.
“Not such a show-off maniac anymore, eh?” He helped He to a handful of <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frogs from the immense pile on He's bedside cabinet, threw a few to <PER>Harry</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>, and <PER>Neville</PER>, and ripped off the wrapper of He's own with He's teeth.
“Yes, they’re very complimentary about you now, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, now scanning down the article.
The curse Dolohov had used on <PER>Hermione</PER>, though less effective than The curse Dolohov would have been had Dolohov been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in Madam Pomfrey’s words, “quite enough damage to be going on with.” <PER>Hermione</PER> was having to take ten different types of potion every day and although <PER>Hermione</PER> was improving greatly, was already bored with the hospital wing.
“ ‘You-Know- Who’s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four, What the Ministry Should Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Albus <PER>Dumbledore</PER>, pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with <PER>Harry</PER> Potter, page nine ’ Well,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, folding up the newspaper and throwing the newspaper aside, “it’s certainly given them lots to write about.
“He got a very good price for it too, so we’re going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a Crumple- Horned Snorkack.” <PER>Hermione</PER> seemed to struggle with <PER>Hermione</PER> for a moment, then said, “That sounds lovely.” <PER>Ginny</PER> caught <PER>Harry</PER>’s eye and looked away quickly, grinning.
“So anyway,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, sitting up a little straighter and wincing again, “what’s going on in school?” “Well, Flitwick’s got rid of Fred and George’s swamp,” said <PER>Ginny</PER>.
“They sent me all these, you know,” he told <PER>Harry</PER>, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?” <PER>Hermione</PER> looked rather disapproving and asked, “So has all the trouble stopped now <PER>Dumbledore</PER>’s back?” “Yes,” said <PER>Neville</PER>, “everything’s settled right back down again.” “I s’pose Filch is happy, is he?” asked <PER>Ron</PER>, propping a <PER>Cho</PER>colate Frog card featuring <PER>Dumbledore</PER> against his water jug.
<PER>Dumbledore</PER> had strode alone into the forest to rescue <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s from the centaurs.
How <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had done it — how <PER>Dumbledore</PER> had emerged from the trees supporting Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> without so much as a scratch on <PER>Dumbledore</PER> — nobody knew, and <PER>Umbridge</PER> was certainly not telling.
“Sulking, more like,” said <PER>Ginny</PER> “Yeah, <PER>Ginny</PER> shows signs of life if you do this,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises.
“No no ” said <PER>Umbridge</PER>, sinking back into <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s pillows, “no, I must have been dreaming” <PER>Hermione</PER> and <PER>Ginny</PER> muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.
“Speaking of centaurs,” said <PER>Hermione</PER>, when <PER>Hermione</PER> had recovered a little, “who’s Divination teacher now?
“Bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER> wishes Bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER> could’ve got rid of Trelawney for good,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, now munching on Bet <PER>Dumbledore</PER>'s fourteenth Frog.
<PER>Harry</PER> had not told <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Hermione</PER>, or anyone else what the prophecy had contained.
<PER>Neville</PER> had told them it had smashed while <PER>Harry</PER> was pulling <PER>Harry</PER> up the steps in the Death Room, and <PER>Harry</PER> had not yet corrected this impression.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not ready to see their expressions when <PER>Harry</PER> told their that <PER>Harry</PER> must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way “It is a pity it broke,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> quietly, shaking <PER>Hermione</PER>'s head.
“Still, at least <PER>Voldemort</PER> never found out what was in it either — where are you going?” he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as <PER>Harry</PER> stood up.
“Er — <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s,” said <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Wish we could come ” “Say hello to he for we!” called <PER>Hermione</PER>, as <PER>Harry</PER> proceeded down the ward.
“And ask he what’s happening about about his little friend!” <PER>Harry</PER> gave a wave of <PER>Harry</PER>'s hand to show <PER>Harry</PER> had heard and understood as <PER>Harry</PER> left the dormitory.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of windows as <PER>Harry</PER> went.
<PER>Harry</PER> was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to be with people or not.
Whenever <PER>Harry</PER> was in company <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to get away, and whenever <PER>Harry</PER> was alone <PER>Harry</PER> wanted company.
He thought He might really go and visit <PER>Hagrid</PER>, though; He had not talked to He properly since He had returned <PER>Harry</PER> had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that <PER>Harry</PER> knew led down to the Slytherin common room.
<PER>Harry</PER> stopped dead; so did <PER>Malfoy</PER> and the others.
<PER>Harry</PER> knew <PER>Harry</PER> was checking for signs of teachers.
Then <PER>Harry</PER> looked back at <PER>Harry</PER> and said in a low voice, “You’re dead, Potter.” <PER>Harry</PER> raised <PER>Harry</PER>'s eyebrows.
“Funny,” he said, “you’d think I’d have stopped walking around” <PER>Malfoy</PER> looked angrier than <PER>Harry</PER> had ever seen him.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pale, pointed face contorted with rage.
“Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now — ” <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s hand flew toward his wand, but <PER>Harry</PER> was too quick for <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had drawn <PER>Harry</PER>'s own wand before <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s fingers had even entered the pocket of <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes.
“Potter!” The voice rang across the entrance hall; <PER>Snape</PER> had emerged from the staircase leading down to <PER>Snape</PER>'s office, and at the sight of <PER>Snape</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything <PER>Harry</PER> felt toward <PER>Malfoy</PER> Whatever <PER>Dumbledore</PER> said, <PER>Harry</PER> would never forgive <PER>Snape</PER> never “What are you doing, Potter?” said <PER>Snape</PER> coldly as ever, as <PER>Snape</PER> strode over to the four of them.
“I’m trying to decide what curse to use on <PER>Malfoy</PER>, sir,” said <PER>Harry</PER> fiercely.
<PER>Snape</PER> stared at <PER>Snape</PER>.
“Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>!” said <PER>Snape</PER>, striding forward.
“Out of St. Mungo’s, I see!” “Yes, Professor <PER>Snape</PER>,” said Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>, shrugging off her traveling cloak, “I’m quite as good as new.
“Well, Potter, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this,” Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> continued briskly.
<PER>Harry</PER> thrust <PER>Harry</PER>'s wand back inside <PER>Harry</PER>'s robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at <PER>Snape</PER> and <PER>Malfoy</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago, but <PER>Harry</PER> had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it that way.
<PER>Harry</PER> thought at first when <PER>Harry</PER> knocked on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s cabin door that <PER>Harry</PER> was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled Fang over with the enthusiasm of Fang's welcome.
“All righ’, <PER>Harry</PER>!” he said, beaming, when <PER>Harry</PER> approached the fence.
“You — er — feelin’ all righ’, are yeh?” <PER>Harry</PER> knew from the look of concern on <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s face that he was not referring to <PER>Harry</PER>’s physical well- being.
“I’m fine,” <PER>Harry</PER> said quickly, because <PER>Harry</PER> could not bear to discuss the thing that <PER>Harry</PER> knew was in <PER>Hagrid</PER>’s mind.
“Up in a cave, like Sirius did when he — ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at <PER>Harry</PER>, and took a long draft of juice.
<PER>Harry</PER> was starting to wish <PER>Harry</PER> was alone again, and with the idea of hastening <PER>Harry</PER>'s departure <PER>Harry</PER> took several large gulps of <PER>Harry</PER>'s dandelion juice, half emptying <PER>Harry</PER>'s glass.
“Ev’ryone knows you’ve bin tellin’ the truth now, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hagrid</PER> softly and unexpectedly.
“Look ” <PER>Hagrid</PER> leaned toward him across the table, “I knew Sirius longer ’n you did He died in battle, an’ tha’s the way He’d’ve wanted ter go — ” “He didn’t want to go at all!” said <PER>Harry</PER> angrily.
“But still, <PER>Harry</PER> <PER>Harry</PER> was never one ter sit around at home an’ let other people do the fightin’.
“I’ve got to go and visit <PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> in the hospital wing,” he said mechanically.
“Oh all righ then, <PER>Harry</PER> Take care of yerself then, an’ drop back in if yeh’ve got a mo” “Yeah right ” <PER>Harry</PER> crossed to the door as fast as <PER>Harry</PER> could and pulled it open.
<PER>Harry</PER> was out in the sunshine again before <PER>Hagrid</PER> had finished saying goodbye and walked away across the lawn.
Once again, people called out to <PER>Harry</PER> as <PER>Harry</PER> passed.
He closed He's eyes for a few moments, wishing they would all vanish, that He could open He's eyes and find He alone in the grounds A few days ago, before He's exams had finished and He had seen the vision <PER>Voldemort</PER> had planted in He's mind, He would have given almost anything for the Wizarding world to know that He had been telling the truth, for them to believe that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was back and know that <PER>Voldemort</PER> was neither a liar nor mad.
<PER>Ron</PER> and <PER>Hermione</PER> left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term.
<PER>Hermione</PER> showed signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but <PER>Ron</PER> tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name.
<PER>Harry</PER> was not sure whether or not <PER>Harry</PER> wanted to talk about <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather yet; his wishes varied with his mood.
It seemed that Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>, Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER> met Peeves on the way, who seized Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s last chance to do as Fred had instructed and chased Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s gleefully from the premises, whacking Professor <PER>Umbridge</PER>'s alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk.
Indeed, Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> sank back into Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER> could not run cheering after <PER>Umbridge</PER> herself, because Peeves had borrowed Professor <PER>McGonagall</PER>'s walking stick.
“Come on, I’m starving” “I won’t be long Look, you go ahead” But when the dormitory door closed behind <PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Harry</PER> made no effort to speed up <PER>Harry</PER>'s packing.
<PER>Harry</PER> was worried that <PER>Dumbledore</PER> would make some reference to <PER>Harry</PER> in <PER>Harry</PER>'s speech.
<PER>Harry</PER> was sure to mention <PER>Voldemort</PER>’s return; <PER>Harry</PER> had talked to them about it last year, after all <PER>Harry</PER> pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk to make way for folded ones and, as <PER>Harry</PER> did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it.
<PER>Harry</PER> bent down, pulled it out from underneath <PER>Harry</PER>'s trainers, and examined it.
<PER>Harry</PER> sank down onto <PER>Harry</PER>'s bed and unwrapped the package.
<PER>Harry</PER> held it up to <PER>Harry</PER>'s face and saw <PER>Harry</PER>'s own reflection looking back at <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that <PER>Harry</PER> was going to see Sirius, talk to <PER>Harry</PER> again Disappointment was burning in <PER>Harry</PER>'s throat.
<PER>Harry</PER> got up and began throwing <PER>Harry</PER>'s things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror — But then an idea struck <PER>Harry</PER> A better idea than a mirror A much bigger, more important idea How had <PER>Harry</PER> never thought of it before — why had <PER>Harry</PER> never asked?
<PER>Harry</PER> was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as <PER>Harry</PER> ran and barely noticing.
<PER>Harry</PER> hurtled across the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after <PER>Harry</PER>, “The feast is about to start, you know, you’re cutting The feast very fine!” But <PER>Harry</PER> had no intention of going to The feast How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn’t need one, yet now <PER>Harry</PER> ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead.
“Can’t it wait until after the feast?” “No — Nick — please,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, “I really need to talk to <PER>Harry</PER>.
“I can’t pretend I haven’t been expecting it.” <PER>Harry</PER> was holding the door open for <PER>Harry</PER>, but <PER>Harry</PER> drifted through the wall instead.
“Expecting what?” <PER>Harry</PER> asked, as <PER>Harry</PER> closed the door.
“Only only wizards.” “Oh,” said <PER>Harry</PER>, and <PER>Harry</PER> almost laughed with relief.
“Anyway — it doesn’t matter — Sirius won’t care if it’s unusual, he’ll come back, I know he will!” And so strong was his belief that <PER>Harry</PER> actually turned <PER>Harry</PER>'s head to check the door, sure, for a split second, that <PER>Harry</PER> was going to see Sirius, pearly white and transparent but beaming, walking through it toward <PER>Harry</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> felt almost as though <PER>Harry</PER> had lost <PER>Harry</PER>'s godfather all over again in losing the hope that <PER>Harry</PER> might be able to see or speak to <PER>Harry</PER> once more.
<PER>Harry</PER> walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle, wondering whether <PER>Harry</PER> would ever feel cheerful again.
<PER>Harry</PER> had turned the corner toward the Fat Lady’s corridor when <PER>Harry</PER> saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall.
Luna believed so many extraordinary things yet <PER>Harry</PER> had been sure <PER>Harry</PER> had heard voices behind the veil too “Are you sure you don’t want me to help you look for your stuff?” <PER>Harry</PER> said.
“No, I think I’ll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up It always does in the end Well, have a nice holiday, <PER>Harry</PER>.” “Yeah yeah, you too.” She walked away from <PER>Harry</PER>, and as <PER>Harry</PER> watched Shis go, <PER>Harry</PER> found that the terrible weight in <PER>Harry</PER>'s stomach seemed to have lessened slightly.
Firstly, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle, who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses, attempted to ambush <PER>Harry</PER> halfway down the train as <PER>Harry</PER> made <PER>Harry</PER>'s way back from the toilet.
By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes <PER>Harry</PER> had taught them, <PER>Malfoy</PER>, Crabbe, and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as <PER>Harry</PER>, Ernie, and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze.
“I must say, I’m looking forward to seeing <PER>Malfoy</PER>’s mother’s face when he gets off the train,” said Ernie with some satisfaction, as he watched <PER>Malfoy</PER> squirm above him.
“He’s loads betterlooking now Anyway, <PER>Harry</PER>, the food trolley’s just stopped if you want anything” <PER>Harry</PER> thanked the others and accompanied <PER>Ron</PER> back to their compartment, where he bought a large pile of Cauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Pasties.
<PER>Hermione</PER> was reading the Daily Prophet again, <PER>Ginny</PER> was doing a quiz in The Quibbler, and <PER>Neville</PER> was stroking his Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched.
<PER>Harry</PER> and <PER>Ron</PER> whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while <PER>Hermione</PER> read out snippets from the Prophet It was now full of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord <PER>Voldemort</PER> walking past their house that very morning “It hasn’t really started yet,” sighed <PER>Hermione</PER> gloomily, folding up the newspaper again.
“But it won’t be long now” “Hey, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Ron</PER>, nodding toward the glass window onto the corridor.
<PER>Cho</PER> and <PER>Cho</PER>’s eyes met for a moment.
<PER>Harry</PER> looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of <PER>Harry</PER>'s pawns chased off its square by <PER>Ron</PER>’s knight.
Wanting to impress <PER>Cho</PER> seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with <PER>Cho</PER>.
So much of what <PER>Cho</PER> had wanted before Sirius’s death felt that way these days The week that had elapsed since <PER>Cho</PER> had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer: It stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in It, and the one without.
“Who’s she with now anyway?” <PER>Ron</PER> asked <PER>Hermione</PER>, but it was <PER>Ginny</PER> who answered.
As the train slowed down in the approach to King’s Cross, <PER>Harry</PER> thought <PER>Harry</PER> had never wanted to leave it less.
<PER>Harry</PER> even wondered fleetingly what would happen if <PER>Harry</PER> simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take <PER>Harry</PER> back to Hogwarts.
When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, <PER>Harry</PER> lifted down Hedwig’s cage and prepared to drag <PER>Harry</PER>'s trunk from the train as usual.
When the ticket inspector signaled to him, <PER>Ron</PER>, and <PER>Hermione</PER> that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, <PER>Harry</PER> found a surprise awaiting <PER>Harry</PER> on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet <PER>Harry</PER> whom <PER>Harry</PER> had not expected at all.
“<PER>Ron</PER>, <PER>Ginny</PER>!” called Molly, hurrying forward and hugging Molly's children tightly.
“Oh, and <PER>Harry</PER> dear — how are you?” “Fine,” lied <PER>Harry</PER>, as she pulled <PER>Harry</PER> into a tight embrace.
“Business is booming and we thought we’d treat we.” “Hello, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said Lupin, as Molly let go of <PER>Harry</PER> and turned to greet <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Harry</PER> leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see <PER>Harry</PER>’s reception committee.
“Ah, <PER>Harry</PER>!” said Arthur, turning from <PER>Hermione</PER>’s parents, whom he had been greeting enthusiastically, and who were taking it in turns to hug <PER>Hermione</PER>.
<PER>Hermione</PER> disengaged <PER>Hermione</PER> gently from <PER>Hermione</PER>'s mother to join the group.
“You might remember me, my name’s Arthur Weasley.” As Arthur had singlehandedly demolished most of the Dursleys’ living room two years previously, <PER>Harry</PER> would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten <PER>Harry</PER>.
“Yes,” said Arthur, “even if you won’t let <PER>Harry</PER> use the fellytone — ” “ Telephone ,” whispered <PER>Hermione</PER>.
“Keep in touch.” “<PER>Harry</PER>, we’ll have you away from there as soon as we can,” Molly whispered, hugging “<PER>Harry</PER> again.
“We’ll see you soon, mate,” said <PER>Ron</PER> anxiously, shaking <PER>Harry</PER>’s hand.
“Really soon, <PER>Harry</PER>,” said <PER>Hermione</PER> earnestly.
